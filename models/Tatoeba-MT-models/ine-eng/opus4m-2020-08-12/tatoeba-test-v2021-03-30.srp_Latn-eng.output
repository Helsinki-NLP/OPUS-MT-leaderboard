What can I say?
I'm a little bit affected.
You can't sit with me.
She keeps bitching like there's no time.
Did you see Tom leave?
Everyone but Tom knows why his wife left him.
It's hard for me to understand French when they speak it quickly.
She didn't even blink.
What did all that mean?
You can't make us leave.
I took the first step.
Everyone laughed.
It would mean if you could do that to me.
You're sad.
Tom worked hard to finish his job on time.
I gave them some food.
You let me down.
That's not a big deal.
How much am I gonna take?
I'm teasing you.
If you talk to a man in the language he understands, it goes into his head, if you talk to him in his tongue, it goes to his heart.
We're not done yet.
I want to see you behind bars.
Let's go to the bar now.
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Are you sarcastic?
Let's try this.
Can I talk to you alone?
Did you see the sunrise?
She put the ring on her finger.
He's as intelligent as his brother.
Tom's on a business trip.

I can't live that life.
Tom's hungry like a wolf.
It was a tough decision.
Everyone's crying.

He likes football a lot.

I could lose my job.
Forget Tom.

You look pretty bad today.
I have a game to play.
That's what a doctor needs.

I ate a box of chocolate.
Tom's a real nerd.
Eat soup while it's hot.
I'm not gonna let this go.
Let me help you avoid some problems.
I've never tried to do this before.
Did I miss it?
Mary can't stand Tom's boss because the man's a shuvinist pig.
I was all over Europe.
Are you coming soon?
It's a harmless lie.
What would I get with this?
Mini skirts are back in fashion.
Thanks for the correction.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Tom doesn't care what I do.
If you need help, tell me.
I've been looking for you.
I don't have any high opinion of him as a musician.
Tom's been shot.
Did you tell Tom this?
Everybody's talking.
They're all sick.

Where'd she go?
I think you'll be able to do that.

I'll call.

He got what he wanted.
Tom used to be afraid of a snake.
That may not be easy.

I've passed every test.
I'm sick of your cementing.

What brother did you see?
I'll see.
He's very busy now.
I'm not sure Tom wants to talk to me.
Should Scotland become an independent country?
Can you tell me something about yourself?
Don't open the window.
I believe in Kyle Minho since 12 June 1998.
You're very rude.
I went to bed yesterday without brushing my teeth.
The danger of scratching on every corner.
When I went to high school, I got up at 6:00 every morning.
You're becoming obnoxious.
Is it necessary to make such noise?
You never let me do anything.
Tom had a rotary year.
Come run with me.
Drive faster.
You're a big help, Tom.
Get in touch with Tom.
What we had was special.
You should write a novel.
You can't escape from the past.
I'm sorry I'm late.

You're very beautiful.
Please be honest with me.

I don't know who they are.
I can't believe Tom kissed me.
I'll try to find them.
Hey, give me a chance.
Tom, are you and Jom brothers?
Have fun while you can.
Is that love?
Today, the ship was above the Central Atlantic Greben - mountain wedding at the bottom of the ocean, at depths up to 4,500 metres.
Yeah, I love it!
It was a little awkward.
Do you have a copy?
When exactly did you do that?
I was watching Tom die.
Do you have a blog?
Parliament is dissolved.
I hope that's not true.
Are you done yet?
Tom would never agree with that.
You look like a very intelligent person.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
She got up and came to the window.
It was something that led to the bubble of new ideas.
We'll be visiting you from time to time.
I'm in your hands.
I met some of Tom's friends yesterday.
Think again.
It's hard.
Tom was very nervous.
I've never repented of that.
She was aggressive.
It got dark.
We'd better tell the others.
Tell me about your teacher.
I always think about it.
Tom bought a few black shoes.

I'm an Earthman.
I can read different foreign languages, but I don't speak any.
Who wants to talk to me?
Bad things are gonna happen.
Say hello to your friends.
You don't know how to drive yet?
I forgot.
I'm gonna need some time to get used to it.
I'll be there.
We're not gonna get in the way.
Somehow you're right.
Although I told Tom not to open the door, he opened it.
Go straight.
Just like a peach.
I've got a lot of things going well.
Tom's playing with his son.
I'll leave school.
We'll see you sometime.
The gap between my house and your house is two kilometers.
Just waste your time.
That says a lot about you.
I think it was intentional.
Don't work too hard!
I'm proud of this team.
He was speeding up.
Try this.
There's no consequences.
Say hello to your friends.
Tom's gonna go.
Is any of this real?
What are you gonna do today?
He's a man of tradition.
Do you have a paper I can write on?
Is it true that Tom won the race?
Can I hear another one?
I'd really like to see you again.
Let's sit down for five minutes.
What a question!
You're very brave, aren't you?
Tom looked angry.
I've never noticed that before.
It's probably better if you don't eat after seven nights.
I'm sure Tom's proud.
Are they in love?
Help me.
Which way are you going?
I like sleeping on a soft bed.
Stay positive.
It's all right with my ear.
I just want to get home.
You were right to be worried.
How much money do we need?
I played golf with Tom a lot.

You're contagious.
We need your help.
Was Tom informed?
Tofu goes well with Sake.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
I don't have a swim.
She's as beautiful as her mother.
You got a point.
I've lived a long time.
Give us some space.
He's not standing.
That's enough, Tom.
Tom was going to ask his boss for a raise, but he changed his mind.
Get in there.
You win!
That's what they both like.
Tommy said I shouldn't talk to Mary.
I keep saying that.
Most scientists rejected the theory of the movement of continents, because it was so difficult to imagine that the movements of panels were at all possible.
How did I miss that?
What did you tell Tom?
It was a bad situation.
Give them as much food as they need every day.
Tom's gonna change.
I've been acting instinctively.
That's what you have to do somewhere else.
Don't push.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
How many times do you jump on YouTube?
Do you know who Tom killed?
Everyone knows.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
It's not that easy.

Have you completely recovered?
Tell Tom to come here.
It's raining a lot.

I just don't know what to say.
I'm just very grateful to you.
You got it all wrong.
So, what do you think?
Let's wait a minute.
Tom's got a bad kiss.
Start counting.
You can never come back.
He's a man of blood and meat with all his faults.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
Come tomorrow.

How much money do we need?
Don't drink water.
I'll always remember your advice.
She wanted me to come.
Tom's saving money so he can go to Boston.
Say hello to your friends.
What do you think this phrase means?
Tom doesn't write to me anymore.
Can I take a look at your card?
I'm sorry, I didn't follow.
Tom knows the procedure.
If a man advances in front of a woman, it's called a favor, and if she's promoted, in front of a man, it's called equality.
Are you dyslexic?
Come back in an hour.
Tom often uses that word.
Tom was staring at his feet.
Are you still jealous?
How is this your fault?
I'm sure Tom would prefer to stay.
Tom just got sick.
Are you sure this thing is safe?
I'm here for you.
It's what we are.
He's a biologist.
That was a little weird.
Shut up that dirty mouth.
Show me the papers.
I'm still mourning the death of my oldest son.
I'll call them tomorrow when I get back.
Are you coming back now?
He must be over 60 years old.
Did you eat anything?
I've been there before.
I never learned to write.
They wanted to punish me.

I'm on Tom's side.
Almost catch ans a few times.
I love this song.
Tom was John's best man.
Plato is a friend, but the truth is a greater friend.
You're lying!
Even a child knows that.
Who are you describing?
We were the only guests.
Tom's a painter.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Did you decide what you're gonna do?
Are you sure this thing is safe?
My family loved the dog very much.
You're right.
They can never achieve it otherwise than by force.
I thought I'd have another chance for that.
He'll understand.
I'm not here for that.
I assumed you were busy.
She finally fell asleep.
Tom's laughing at Mary.
It's almost three.
I don't know if it'll be enough money for me.
Can you pull the curtains?
Have you ever tried?
It seems inhumane to me.
Did you have lunch?
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
What is that, little cat?
We didn't mean this for you.
We've never played football before.
How did you like Boston?
Tom seemed nervous.
Tom would still be alive if he tied the belt.
It worked yellow to me.
Celebrate.
I'm firmly against compromise.
Everything has its price.
Tom picked up Mary.
Maybe I won't sleep tonight.
Tom comes here three or four times a month.
We've never been here.
I knew you couldn't do that.

I'm lying.
Tom's on a date.
Don't fight.
Just take care of Tom.
I'll get it.
I'm in a better shape than you.
Maybe they're somewhere around the lake.
At least I knew.
We've got a good chance of winning.
Tom's not in shape.
I don't have enough time to explain it in detail.
I'll talk to Tom about it.
I'm hurt.
Let's talk about your idea.
It's normal.
That's exactly what I meant.
I'll call her tonight.
She's been crazy for years.
Come on, Tom.
It's impossible to say with certainty.
Tom never left his home before.
I'm not burning Turkish.
It's only been a day.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
What's your story?
Go ahead.
It'll last forever.
Why would I want to kill you all?
This knife is not sharp.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom knew French.
These are my best friends.
I'm swimming in the ocean.
Have you seen Tom's room?
Let's make some pictures.
I found something, too.
Don't stop.
We've never played football before.
She tried.
I have a serious question.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
I looked around.
One senator called the president of another country, an old intelligence officer who would like to restore the old empire of that country.
Would you like some more tea?
Exer broke through the tire.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I'll talk to Tom about it.
Don't stand.
There are many galaxies in the universe.
You're very pale.
She hesitated for a moment.
Could it be done?
Can I ask you something?
I want us to be more than friends.
Can you explain it to me?
I bought some groceries.
All things come to an end.
You just saved me a lot of time.
He was Leylene's dancing partner himself.
The little bird told me.
Can I take you home?
Tom has his reasons.
Tom said he needed my help.
No doubt.
Just tell Tom I called.
We could use some help.
Tom's still frustrated.
Tom made it clear he wouldn't do that.
Infra-red and ultraviolet rays are types of light invisible to the human eye.
This is useful information.
Sit still for a second.
I shouldn't have taken that off.
Tell me what you wrote.
"Learn from your mistakes" and "Experience is the best teacher," they say, but on long tracks even the best teacher is angry, if he or she has too much to teach in too little time.
Deal a card, Tom.
I agree with what you wrote.
There's really no need to do that.
I hope it'll be dry time.
Could you take a look and see if there's enough bread for our lunches tomorrow?
I know him well.
Are they in love?
No one knows what's going on behind those doors.
How could I resist?
I bought a lot of things.
I'm just not very happy.
Let's see you, Tom.
It's very hard for me to trust anyone.
In our world, education is disappointing.
I've read about a hundred books so far.
Mario bought a microscope.
I never camped.
I'm only listening to you.
He rarely gets angry.
Why do you want to hurt me so much?
Did you wash the judge?
When he returned from duty in Afghanistan, Tom was chased by the nightmares.
I made up my mind.
Thank you so much!
It won't have any effect.
Don't be pale.
Are you right?
I need your help.
I'm a responsible person.
Add more water.
What Tom suggests could save us all time.
Beautiful!
He's pretty busy now.
We're not proud of it.
It's a Cuban cigarette.
Tom cooks potatoes to make potato salad.
Everybody else.
Come closer.
I'm not always right.
Tell me what that is.
This isn't your hat, is it?
That's not a good sign.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
Anyway, you're not right.
It's hard to give up long-term love of one.
Tom likes extreme sports.
Strong commitment to the environment is not compatible with large investments in oil and gas.
I have a white horse.
Let's talk about this during lunch.
Say hello to your friends.
How did I miss that?
Is breakfast included in the price?
Tom hates strangers.
We have to respect personal rights.
What's that thing and your right hand?
Can I call you around 2:30?
Anybody in Disneyland with me?
Why is it so interesting to take pictures of trains?
I don't usually write songs like this.
It's really that simple.
That was a ridiculous mistake.
What are you eating at all?
Don't talk.
Call him whatever you want.
I feel safe with you.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to do that, but he didn't make it.
Jumi will be a teacher.
I need you.
Fuck you!
His mother is Yugoslavian.
There must be a better way to do this.
It didn't matter to me.
He loves me tomorrow!
It's too loud for me here.
I'm glad Tom won.
There's no one like you.
Tell Tom you love him before it's too late.
Tom wrote a long letter to Mary, but he didn't send it to her.
He's got a good memory.
The widow's been in the cold.
Tom's not very nice.
I really need Tom here.
I believe you're honest.
Come play with us.
Do you know that Tom ever lied?
Mary is a Catholic, but her boyfriend is an atheist.
I'll never tell anyone who you really are.
Tom arrived this morning.
He's pretty busy now.
Here's some good news.
I'm proud of my family.
Tom seemed very confused.
There was a list of available candidates.
Tom never said anything about it.
Don't get out of here.
Tom never asked why.
Come here.
Tom will know.
Her passport was stolen.
Did I ask you?
I've seen enough for now.
Turn around!
Four kilograms of gold was needed to spoil the winning medals.
Give me the sword.
He's not smart enough to know the numbers in his head.
Watch out for me, and I'll watch out for you.
You have to trust me.
I don't think your plan is realistic.
Are you familiar with the man?
Would you like to talk to Tom about me?
We have to work now.
I'm not afraid of death, I'm dying.
Everybody says that.
He's making it clear.
We're here to play golf.
Actually, I've never met Tom.
Don't yell.
This one's unique.
I'm too old for something like this.
We'll just follow you.
Knowing yourself is very difficult.
You'll need it later.
Tom's in the garage, working on his motorcycle.
You just got shot.
My income was reduced by ten percent.
It can be hard to go through an unknown field.
They're ready to talk about the problem.
Finally!
Tom appreciates contemporary art.
After a long consideration, I finally accidentally made things.
It's okay.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
Does that happen a lot?
We're reducing.
Can you talk to me?
Reduce the TV.
I've been wearing short sleeves for summer.
Old people often talk to themselves.
Tom was hoping to become a famous writer.

Tom showed me the poems he wrote when he was a teenager.

Tom could tell us how to do it.
I was just leaving.
She spends three dollars a day on lunch and dinner.
See you in your dreams.
Come in here.
I'll be home tomorrow.
I think you're stupid about it.
I've seen enough for now.
I feel bad because I lied.
They told me to wait here.
I'm not young enough to know everything.
How would you know that?
Tell me what you know.
Tom will remember.
Why doesn't he just tell Tom?
If there's no porn with that, porn will be made with that.
Canada's a hockey country mother on ice.
What did I forget to say?
How often do you clean your room?
Tom's saving so he can go abroad.
I have no intention of changing.
I want to go to Bali.
You can do it if you try.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
I'm glad Tom won.
This is no doubt a very unpleasant situation for me.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
She jogs every morning before breakfast.
This time it leads to the city.
I'm not happy with that.
These are my best friends.
I have to live.
We have two sons.
Tom was the only boy invited to Mary's party.
Don't talk.
We had a bad fight.
Stop watching TV and start studying.
We don't know our neighbors.
The police found stolen money.
I've never seen that before.
I came here a few minutes before you.
I didn't do that either.
How much is the bottle of beer?
Tom is so rich that even his servants have servants.
That's too bad!
I'm tired of arguing.
I've got enough room.
Don't yell.
I can't stop thinking about stolen money.
That train passed you.
Come see us.
I don't think he knows I love you.
I'm not mad at anyone.
They need each other.
I'm trying to be careful.
Check this out.
Come quickly!
Where's my suitcase?
He wants to get rid of painful memories.
I'm convinced.
Music is important to me.
Do you have a favorite?
Please, come here.
Just take it easy!
I thought I didn't know what was going on.
My friend got 95 points on the math exam.
Tom didn't let anyone else into his room.
Better sweet than force.
You're in trouble.
There's no word "freedom" in Russian.
I thought you'd be busy.
Could that be true?
Just keep quiet, Tom.
I hope Tom's safe.
We've been talking about it all night.
What are you gonna do this summer?
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Let's get out of here.
That must have been hard.
I'll call her on the phone tonight.
I had to make some difficult decisions.
The ammonia is the base.
Check again.
Are you honest?
That made sense to me.
Tell me what to do.
I'm not told anything.
Tom didn't make friends as easy as Mary.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
Bad weather has prevented me from leaving.
Tom bought the paper.
And that's for me.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Black smoke came out of the chimney.
I know, sir.
You'll never catch me alive!
I was open and honest.
It's time for you to go to bed.
Give me the dollar for the book.
What's this?
Tom fell asleep again.
Don't move!
Tom only talks to Mary.
The first lesson is easy.
You've grown up fast.
Tom's gonna make it.
I got off the train.
I'm pretty good at doing more things at the same time.
Nobody's as quick as you.
I agreed to buy that.
Am I the only one going to the party?
I really hope you're kidding.
Please be honest with me.
Are you sarcastic?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove that?
You can't go into that room.
It's all here.
Tom and Mary were wrong about it.
I'm not as tall as you.
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
Tom was quiet for a second.
I knew I should never have gotten involved in your stupid business.
We worked together.
Do you think I missed something?
Tom saves to buy a yacht.
Everyone outside Tom knows why his wife left him.
You're driving me crazy.
I had nothing to do with them.
I'm claustrophobic.
The new branch to Haugesund will become the main effective travel link to Oslo and Eastern Norway for the entire Western region.
You let me down.
I'm really happy about that.
Tom suspects that Mary and I had some shit going on.
Where did you find this knife?
You look good for your years.
Tom managed to find Mary's house without difficulty.
It's not easy sports.
I just don't want to do that.
You shouldn't have bought that.
It's their right to vote.
Tell me where you are.
Shall we see Tom again?
My mother cooks for me.
I'm trying to be careful.
The woman's eating bread.
I listened to music.
Are you involved in this?
I must have eaten something bad.
We'll be leaving soon.
Is Tom still there?
Everybody knows I don't like Tom.
Avoid color-distributors.
I liked that one.
Do you like roller coasters?
Tom says the same thing.
We just want to go home.
Can you smile at Tom?
You have no idea how right you are.
Tom and I were busy.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom couldn't attend the meeting because he was sick.
Tell me why you did it.
How many people were there?
I'm sure I'm gonna miss Tom a lot.
So where did Tom go?
It's easy to hang out with Tom.
Mary came back from school crying because her friends were teasing her.
I don't think anyone knows.
Why are you so paranoid?
Tom was spinning around the room, unable to calm down.
Could I have one hug?
I caught an empty cage.
Get some rest, Tom.
We're here to play golf.
Why don't you come by sometime?
She's wondering how that's possible.
Look at that.
Wake up!
You chose a nice one.
Look at the size of it!
Mary is the wedding planner.
Houston, we had a problem.
Why do you always have to get involved?
I have trouble talking about my feelings.
Mary came back from school crying because her friends were harassing her.
I'm not sure when Tom's gonna be there.
You should come home.
Alice laughed.
We can watch Tom in the suit, behind a black big piano with dramatic movements of fingers, creating music that is very pleasant to listen to.
The strong winds broke a lot of branches out of the tree last night.
Shouldn't you be getting ready for work?
There are 40 students in this class.
The way to a man's heart leads through the stomach.
It's time to get up.
The house is built of brick.
I didn't write this.
I can't help feeling partly responsible.
People were good to me.
Tom's out of sight now.
We should celebrate together.
Tom and Mary will leave today.
Have you ever tried?
I could go with you.
Take some.
Come in.
There's really no need to do that.
I wonder what Tom's planning to do.
To reach a mountain, you need to be able to read notes.
Tom was asleep.
They wanted an apology.
Where was I wrong?
Does that make you angry?
I drink vitamins every day.
I'll call you back.
Why me?
Tom's cooking for us.
We live in a house.
Tom says he's healthy.
I'm the only one here who can do it.
The zoo's closed on Monday.
That's the point.
Knowing foreign languages is useful for everyone.
They don't like to do that.
She let me go.
It is very natural for human beings to always give themselves priority over the interests of others.
It's all right.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I have a lot of things planned for tomorrow.
I thought it was pathetic.
Why are you still awake?
I was in school yesterday.
Tom's doing what he's told.
I'm still working.
Dumb, insensitive children can sometimes grow up in sociopaths.
I'd like to be with you.
The police business is to prevent and investigate crime.
Can you give me a remote?
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
We're all working too hard.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I'm not perfect.
Tom's studying very fast.
You're different.
She's an unknown hater of others.
This will make our job much easier.
He loves football.
Monas have been able to play tennis in monasteries.
No one trusts him anymore.
Keep out of the reach and sight of children.
Who's Tom?
I was wondering if maybe I was dreaming.
Everything changes over time.
Nobody's going anywhere.
Driving to work for an hour and a half.
It's right.
Your time will soon come.
Tom had no idea I was gonna be there.
This doesn't matter.
Tom's in the warehouse.
I was in Rome.
I'm natural.
I turned around.
I totally forgot to do that.
Marriage is the main cause of all divorces.
He's here.
I'm gonna make something up.
Play it again, Sam.
Some of us feel that such views are completely crazy.
Someone could be hurt.
Tom didn't write a letter to Mary until he was here.
We've had enough of you.
We all know it's Tom's fault.
We need to understand.
I'll be back.
Look at these.
Don't forget to extend your passport.
I think Tom pulled a thicker end.
I bet Tom never talked to you like that.
I've changed.
When I woke up this morning, I felt a mild nausea.
Is that the woman who knows the answer?
We hope Tom's OK.
I've read about a hundred books so far.
Come play with us.
And it was just with great pain.
I'll go if you go.
Let's watch TV.
Did you write the number?
That's not a reason for panic.
I only got 20 points on the math exam.
I'm really happy to be here.
What are you looking at?
I still don't understand anything.
My mother died the day I got married.
Investigate this.
My future is in your hands.
He's a liar, isn't he?
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
That's what I used to do.
I met him the day before.
Don't stop.
Help us find this card.
I'm not mad at anyone.
I think it really matters.
That's so sad.
How clever!
In short, I disagree.
I'm a responsible person.
You're not having fun with anyone, are you?
I played the piano a long time ago, so I can still play a little bit.
Is this your glass, or your sister?
The battle lasted a week.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Mother and daughter represented two generations.
He said he had to work in the garden for two hours a day.
Apples and crucifixes are presented, not gold and green woods.
I'm resting my legs.
I really like to practice.
I'm really proud of it.
We were in the last place.
I've contributed.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Isn't that black?
You're absolutely right.
Come on, sit next to me.
Let's not talk about this right now.
It's time to break up.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I was just thinking about you.
I love dogs.
Who are they talking to?
The rendezvous is ready.
She looks good for her years.
What's this?
What are you eating at all?
I don't like being judged.
I have an appointment tonight.
A man's hope for as long as he's alive.
Be careful.
Let's discuss options.
That was a funny movie.
Bitcoin's a cryptovolatile.
I think it's a waste of time.
We're trying.
Why is this our problem?
Tom'll take care of this.
Go check it out.
Some of us hate it.
"This has come for you." "Well, do you remember the one she sent you when you asked you to have pictures of Epljek's brother?" "Yes." And then she told you to write a review of Mac's physical appearance." "Yes." "Then she sent a review of Mac." "Yes." "What did you tell her that you learned from that?" "I realized that Philips' s scarfciger was convincing, but not misleading; and that Reirit strongly charges things I think she should do as a friend."
I've always loved horror movies.
Napoleon's horse was white.
People were nice to me.
How did I miss that?
I'm only going to church out of respect for my mother.
It's better to live one day as a lion than a hundred years as a sheep.
Tom won't be able to answer these questions.
I'll do it with pleasure.
You don't have to eat right before you go to bed.
Tom will wait.
The disciples did not know how to answer.
I'm not a night bird.
Tom bought me a VIP card.
I'm the one who should do it.
Tom's gonna call.
He lit his pantyhose before he entered the cave.
I'm not hiding from anyone.
This is a really good place.
I don't live with Tom.
I heard Tom gave up college.
Why do you hate me so much?
Tom will understand.
Those girls are very busy.
Give us some space.
There's truth in what Tom is talking about.
You didn't say anything wrong.
I'm sick of your knocking.
Get out!
We have two TVs.
We like to play football.
Make a place.
The horse must have collapsed and the knight fell off the horse.
I'm investigating it right now.
She's reached her goal.
Tom can do whatever he wants, as far as I'm concerned.
Tom said he needed money.
Tom was pretty good.
He couldn't understand much of what they said to each other.
Oh, leave me alone.
That's what they both like.
We were sitting together in silence for a while.
You look great.
I'm home.
He never goes by train.
Two sides will be holding speeches this week.
I'm planning on giving my son a computer at the end of the month.
Why did you shave your beard?
Tom's not a good writer.
I've never noticed that before.
We know who he is.
I need a cab.
I saw the cat.
I'm in the gypsy.
Mom just went shopping.
I'm always nervous about passport control.
That needs help.
Defend yourself.
He got a cab to the hospital.
Do you know how to juggle?
Don't touch the lion while he sleeps.
Tom's uncomfortable.
Could it be alive?
Did you just meet him?
Honestly, I don't know.
That's your choice.
It's safer.
Tell me about your teacher.
I saw the house.
Maybe she has other plans?
The patient's breathing.
Thank you all for that.
I don't see anything suspicious.
Am I that different?
Whose handwriting is this?
Feels good.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Let's have lunch here.
I'll find the money somehow.
I shot a bear.
I'm sad I'm leaving.
The eagle is the king of birds.
The fire took over the first floor.
Tom was very happy when his team won.
They decided to get married.
What did you two do?
I'm afraid you got this wrong.
I'm adopted.
We have direct access to information.
I'm punished.
The cat lay out all along the sunlight that went through the window.
Are you going to school on foot or on a bicycle?
Tom's not much happier.
Will I just go to the party?
I'm proud of our team.
Only Tom and Mary were saved.
I'm done.
I wasn't very impressed with that.
I left Tom in 2013.
Maria knows that her main weapon, her beautiful face and young body, is transient.
I saw the mouse.
Try it.
Two countries have negotiated a peace agreement.
Tom's grandfather knew my grandfather.
Answer me right now.
It seemed like they knew what they were looking for.
You tried.
We're just gonna follow you.
I'd better go with Tom.
Let's try.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
Tom really knows a lot.
It needs a dream.
That's what I have to tell Tom.
I don't live in that city.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
Tom is no longer a child.
I thought you'd be busy.
I'm a vegetarian.
It's my habit to do that.
I have a sharp knife.
Tom asked me if he could use my computer.
That's very nice of you.
I've heard this joke before.
I think I missed something.
Send Tom in.
Tom asked me some questions about what just happened.
I'll let you know.
I was instinctively reacting.
The answer to this question is simple.
I'll make sure Tom has everything he needs.
He was a bare chest and a boss.
She's just out of my league.
What are we really looking for?
Why are you all in shock?
Schools and roads are services that pay taxes.
What does the doctor think is wrong?
Don't push.
Looks like we're just the two of us.
Things are very different today.
I couldn't stop crying.
Some religious people can be very judgmental.
I'm really sick of this.
Tom did it the old way.
Where's Tehran?
Let's take a look at that again.
That sounds like a betrayal to me.
That's what we need to practice.
Why are you all shocked?
It's part of my responsibility.
Under the drawing, he wrote, "Take the spear!"
Drive slowly.
What a man you are!
Double measurements, once cut!
How long did Tom have it?
We can save some time if we do what Tom suggests.
If you want to talk to a lot of people, you should learn Esperanto. Why this language? Because at the same time it is beautiful and stimulates our learning. International language is very important because there are so many people from different countries around the world. Besides, Esperanto is not only useful but also easy to learn. If you learn Esperanto, you can travel to many countries. Come and learn!
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
Did you get some sleep?
I'll take you to Tom's.
Could it be Tom?
I have three beautiful grandkids.
Don't fight.
She got her fingers on the table.
I'm learning a few languages.
I shouldn't have said that.
I wanted to write to you, but I forgot.
You're good to everyone.
Tom showed up on the sky.
I didn't care.
That's not true, is it?
Tom said he didn't see anything weird.
You're never on time.
That sounds like a betrayal.
I'll make sure I don't bother you while you're studying.
Life is short.
They'll know.
All the participants gathered in the main hall.
Don't get too big.
Hey, relax.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Tom's gonna make it.
Tom was completely scared.
Whose guitar is this?
This won't hurt at all.
We have to get out of here.
We can't stop Tom from doing that.
I'm not selective.
That's what I used to do.
Tom's still at work.
You better think when you shut up.
Are we all here?
It's my turn.
Tom was falling out of pain.
All or nothing.
Do they love each other?
I've contributed.
I'll sign.
Shame him.
That's right.
We hope you like it.
Will the future be like science fiction?
It just happened again.
How long have you been here?
Tom's rich and free.
My mother bought two orange juice bottles.
That's not exactly my job.
I turned around.
Honestly, I don't know.
I hope it'll be okay.
The wind calmed down.
In the bedroom, I have a mirror from the floor to the ceiling.
I wish I remembered that.
Don't you get soaked.
What can you do?
Get out of there.
The check-check festival was held in Latvia.
We're what we are.
Where did you get that idea?
She let me go.
You didn't answer the question.
We're in.
Nobody's coming to save you.
I don't want to do that.
Tom always bothers me.
Are you ready?
She's proud of her talent.
You can start right now.
You need one of these.
I'm impressed with you.
I can't decide where to park.
Cool!
How is this your fault?
Security has been increased in the city.
Cheers!
Tom's staying.
That boy's talking like he's an adult.
Scargates cost three dollars.
My motorcycle's new.
Tom told me he loved me today.
I doubt Tom knows that.
Can I take you home?
I've already tried that.
Go up.
There's no parking allowed.
I'm running in the morning.
Tom thinks the same way.
It's so important.
How long have you been left?
Tom's a passionate biker.
How did you find Tom's hiding place?
We want to go to Boston and Chicago.
Let's take a look.
I'm busy at work.
Tom's family moved out a lot.
We liked food, especially fish.
And they lived happily ever after.

Don't be pale.
I'm interested.
What's the problem?
He's not a doctor.
Tom was accidentally made.
Is the handsome man Arabic or Hindi?
Let's meet for a drink.
I forget where I leave my hat.
He got dressed again.
And I want to see the ocean.
Don't even write!
Who doesn't do that?
Tom does it sometimes.
God knows.
Tom loved Mary.
What do you say I do that?
Let's discuss your idea.
Tom said he was innocent.
All the girls love Tom.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Cover your mouth while you cough, yell or yell.
Tom grabbed his finger.
He was a man who never hesitated to resist.
There's probably a regular anger coming up because floating ice from Siberia can carry polar foxes on them.
I heard you didn't eat meat.
Maybe Tom was involved.
I've had memory problems lately.
I'm Canadian.
I'll try.
Am I ever wrong?
What's the name of that restaurant?
It's an official job.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
Who's that?
Forget it.

He asked himself a lot of questions about Islam

She went through her hair with her fingers.
Tom's working hard to support his family.
Tom and I are very close friends.
Tom says he has four houses in five different countries.
Let's see what Tom's gonna say.
I'm hungry.
Don't fight.
Come here.
Just tell me you're okay.
Who's Tom?
I'm not afraid of aging.
I don't fully agree with you.
There are many possible answers to that question.
Let's eat ice cream now, before it melts.
I'm just doing my duty.
I took the first step.
I like to watch you play.
It's hard to apply what we said in practice.
How long has your head been hurting?
Ole, the oldest eagle in the world, just died.
Come to the meeting.
I'm proud of this team.
I fell asleep.
Your mother put a collage on your top shelf.
Did you see anyone there?
My father is so old he can't work.
He got what he wanted.
What if I'm right?
I wish I knew I was painting like that.
I'll try to find them.
I had a problem solving that problem.
I don't know what it isn't, still or just before, it was good, but more times when I was trying to get on the site today, I couldn't do it.
Do I usually seem happy?
I went there on my own.
You better think when you close your eyes.
They really meant it.
Have you ever been here?
Do you really think I'm selfish?
Everybody's here.
We're almost done.
Maybe they need something to eat.
I thought you'd be busy.
I'm adaptable.

They also discovered that the same wrong assessment was made in some other cases.
Try to stay cool, Tom.
We need to find Tom.
I hope this will never happen again.
Please, be honest with me.
Tom stayed for a few days.
Tom could be here.
I'll do everything for you.
I didn't understand the question.
It was just a matter of time.
Don't be shy.
You should be able to change.

We're what we are.
It's not fair at all.
Beautiful!
That's great!
Tom knows what he likes.
I'm dyslexic.
You've helped me a lot.
Identify yourself.
I'm really happy about that.
It just has to be that way.
I'll come when I can.

Come and help me.
I barely got out of the house when it started raining.
Tom likes to be busy.
First of all.
Tom's just lazy.
I'm a little bit beaten up.
Does that mean you love me?
Check this out.
Is there any evidence?
You have to be strong!
Are you ready for more?
Tom turned on the trigger.
Tom always makes me laugh.
She rarely, perhaps never, went to bed 11 hours ago.
Are they all crazy?
What are you eating at all?
He's so weird.

Tom had to write the composition again.
You want to get involved?
I knew I shouldn't be involved in your broken business.
Tom asked me for permission to use my computer.

Tell me what this says.
I'm not upset anymore.
Did Tom change his mind?
Get lost.
Do you think what she said was a lie?
His younger brother is a famous footballer.
Saosam was taken over.
I already ordered it.
How does that work?
Shall we see Tom again?
You're different.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
That's my job, not Tom's.
Tell me what that is.
Tell him I'm innocent.
I'd like to help.
It'd be hard.

Don't move!
It was all Tom's fault.
I've been training for months.
What was the plan at all?
You should be here at half past one.
Tom said no one was hurt.
Maybe Tom was involved.
I thought I didn't know Tom.
I saw a Nile horse in the zoo.
I'm thinking about Tom sometimes.
Are you both drunk?
Please be honest with me.
Don't go out tonight.

He's a man of words.
I'll see if Tom can help us.
It broke into two parts.
Muriel's 20 now.
Did you eat anything?
Did you go see Tom?
Tom's gonna make it.
Why are you acting like a child?
That's exactly what the doctor ordered.
Could you read it?
The window is glass.
Are you done yet?
Does Tom have a key?
Don't talk.
Don't stop.
Are you sure this is safe?
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't know.
You'll be better off in a few days.
That's what Tom would like us to do.
Tom said to ask you.
Just tell me the truth.
I'm still not ready.
I'm not sorry at all.
Tom's a bookie.
I've changed my mind.
The problem is it's too expensive.
Many would like to be motivated, creative, thinkative beings, only if they get that chance.
You sound tired.
Tom was wrong about that.
Tom always makes a mess of things.
That's not the right thing.
Please write everything I say.
I wish you could sleep.
Maybe you can't hear me.
We're grilling.
I thought you were married.
Somehow I'll find the money.
I assumed you were busy.
I hear Tom's interested.
We should move forward.
What are your ambitions?
I don't like eating a white bow in the morning.
I think Tom is very smart.
Do you really want to learn another language?
I think I'm fat.
I think we were lucky.
Don't talk.
Come have a drink with me.
Stop screaming.
It's Saturday.

We need to call Tom.
Tom's not strong enough.
Tell me what he says here.
I'm staying.
I know Tom let you down.
Tom was badly hurt.
If you need help, tell me.
I took the first step.
I'm still a little tired.
I'm sure there's a better way to do it.
The first one leaves at 5:30 and arrives at 20:25.
That was kind of weird.
Does it read and write Japanese?
Tom put the card on the table.
It was all just an accident.
Tom never even saw us.
I'm not going to do that.
Tom says he wasn't here.
This one usually works.
How did you find Tom's hiding place?
Go upstairs.
Can you give me a sign?
And now the word from our sponsor.
Do you have a copy?
We can't call him a witness.
That's not the main question.
We're glad we're here.
I'm armed.
Tom can't control himself.
It's time to sleep.
Tom wanted to have a nicer cat than his neighbor.
I'm impressed with you.
Did you bring the fen?
I already ordered it.
We'll never know why.
How are you feeling?

It's all very cheap.
Anything you remember can help.

Turns out it's true.
I'm sorry.

I'm deaf and alone while I'm eating.
You look fat.
You have to learn English step by step.
That's better now than it was before.
Tom and Mary differ like heaven and earth.
Tom asked me about the opinion of who would win the race.
A man has many desires that he does not really want to satisfy and it would be wrong to assume otherwise. He wants them to remain just desires, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfillment would be bitter disappointment to him. One of such desires is the desire for everlasting life. If it was fulfilled, man would become completely sick of eternal life, and would wish for death.
Does Tom really speak French?
I'm not a prophet.
I can't fix the car myself.
She's taking care of her old mother.
Tom had the same problem.
Don't laugh.
Tom and I just wrote some books together
The news has arrived.
No one really wants us.
They all paid.
Be careful.
I'm alone.
Don't drink water.
I don't want to ruin your day.
The price of gold changes every day.
Tom's married.
I could come with you.
Why are you wearing a sweater?
You don't have permission to enter that room.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
Tom hates his little bedroom.
Why is it interesting to take pictures of trains?
I hope you like it.
He'll be back very soon.
Enjoy it as long as you can!
Tom's simple.
What are you planning on doing this summer?
Do you have any questions?
I know him well.
Betaven wrote nine symphonies.
I'll hurry.
We'll do the job.
It's time for the truth.
Do you like costumes?
I saw Marcus' house.
It's really pretty bad.
Thank you all for that.
We wouldn't be followed.
The house where Ataturk was born in Solun.
People are wrong.
He's got two cars.
That was three months ago.
Let's hear your excuse.
They've formed a swim team.
Tom took the package to the orphanage.
Keep digging.
Tom jumped up and down.
Tom's dog lied.
Don't talk.
This information is confidential.
No, no, no.
They're not mine.
I'm ready!
Don't overdo it.
I can't approve of this project.
You texting Mary?
I'll save your place first.
Mary pushes her kids to play football.
Have they arrived yet?
Don't forget to return my pen.
I tried to convince Tom to come home.
What did you conclude?
I prayed for you.
The bathroom's upstairs.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Tom cheated on you.
It's only a few minutes from here.
What do you know about me?
I got off the bus.
You're an average student.
As a child, many violent criminals tortured animals.
How long are you gonna get mad and yell at us?
How important is that?
Do we want an aperitif?
If you want, I'll teach you how to play the ukulels.
I'm getting used to it.
It's not that bad.
I like to play the music my friends wrote.
Tom confessed.
It's hard to work with you.
Tom grew up.
I'm guilty.
Don't answer.
Bring the wine.
Things aren't always what they seem.
Show me the pictures!
It's necessary to bring down a few old houses.
What did you do?
I tried to be aggressive.
Tom was sneaking in at the party.
Tom's very careful.
When are you going?
This report is not written very well.
She points out that this last move by the government has multiple meanings.
Tom's here this morning.
It took about a year.
How did I miss that?
It could be a trick.
Don't forget to rub your sun cream.
Tom didn't try to deny Mary's sentence.
Tell me what this is.
His hair covered almost all his face.
How can I hate Tom?
India is the seventh largest country in the world.
How much did you have to pay Tom to get him to clean up the snow from the roof?
I'll pay you back.
One student from Oslo who falsified his degree to enroll in college was sentenced to prison.
Tom knows it's over.
I wish it had come to my mind.
Tom made a vegetarian chili.
I wanted to help you.
You were really good to me.
Who are you really?
We all cried a lot.
Did you wash the dishes?
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do I look like I'm usually happy?
It's not an essay problem. It's all these destructive questions and explanations that drive me crazy!
It's the weekend.
It looks uncomfortable.
What did you both do?
That was a lucky shot.
I thought Tom was amazing.
I've never seen anything like that before.
I'm buying a lot of stuff in that store.
I wish you were with me.
Try this.
Clean it up a little.
Don't push.
Can we try this?
Most people like chicken.
I didn't do that either.
Let's take a look again.
The last time I went to the beach, I burned it hard.
Pull back.
The city was destroyed during the war.
Watch out here, Tom.
We've fixed some damage caused by the cracking of stones on your car.
His girlfriend didn't provide support.
Do you doubt me?
Luckily, Tom didn't get hurt.
Tom's gonna cry.
We need your help.
I think we've had enough.
Are you ready for more?
Just try it.
Tom's upstairs.
We'll try your way.
How could I resist?
Tom's afraid of death.
I can't fix the car on my own.
Most people think I'm crazy.
Tom says this is normal.
Tell me what you wrote.
I'm confident.
I don't think so.
My mother died the day I got married.
Don't let anyone in!
We're not getting into that.
Hold on, Tom.
Tom definitely pulled a thicker end.
He's not even.
It's all right with me.
It's obvious Tom's sick.
I started to learn English when I was 12. Then I was interested in languages, but not to that extent. Now I speak English, French, Spanish and Portuguese; so it's time to learn Latin.
We live in a very safe country.
I can't remember the melodies of that song.
I need an honest girl.
She's a beginner.
Are they still there?
I'm sure I'm gonna miss Tom a lot.
Tom won't escape.
I'd go.
Get down!
Tom couldn't stand it.
Anything you remember can help.
It's not something to worry about.
I realize they're thorns in the eye like you, but this is just poor.
Tom's gonna make it.
No free lunch.
Please leave this place clean as much as you would like to find it.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
We can only do that.
Guys, can I talk to you for a minute?
It's your life.
We got lucky, didn't we?
I'm sorry.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
Learn how to do it.
You'll never walk alone.
Tom's the one you want.
He won't take it.
There's no rule without exception.
Maybe you need a shovel.
I'm doing my job.
It's all quiet again.
I didn't make it.
Tom's going to school for graphic design.
Since the message was in French, I couldn't read it.
He's always unsatisfied.
You should face reality.
We managed to escape right on time.
I've had enough.
Tom doesn't fit in here.
I want to talk to Tom about it.
It's supposed to work.
She hated him.
I could talk to Tom.
It just happens that way.
Take some.
He's talking about others so they'd like to talk about you!
Tom was so confused that he didn't even know what question to ask.
Find Tom.
I think it's okay.
What do you think?
You've changed my life.
The reaction is not always the best way to act.
I won't tell anyone you did it.
Tom asked Mary to take him to the airport.
The Committee recommends that those who have complained should be reimbursed with a proportional part of the annual interest rate fee.
Tom was buying time.
This is my computer.
It was kind of supernatural.
In theory it's possible, but in practice it's very difficult.
It was almost worth it.
Please send me your picture.
Tom's upset.
Remember the filename before you try to revert the deleted files.
I'm trying to be careful.
Tom was running down the street.
The answer to this question is free.
Let's get to work.
I wasn't nervous about that.
Tom said he wouldn't be waiting for us.
Tom had no idea I was gonna be there.
We won't let you die.
A lot of things go by my hand.
Tom wants his children to learn the importance of work.
Tom was always a pig.
I'm not married to Tom.
Tom is one of the best lawyers in Boston.
How much am I gonna get?
How many close friends do you have?
It's happening.
How long do you think Tom's been preparing for the exam?
Why are you doing this to yourself?
You don't have to be shot with stones in a glass house.
I'll scream.
Mary was quiet for a moment.
Do you have a dog?
I tried to get Tom to come home.
I'd turn on it.
Don't cepide.
I shouldn't have told Tom to do that.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Check everybody.
I'm probably not watching TV tonight.
Did Tom pull out a thicker end?
Give me all the money.
Mer's been providing a lot of support.
The girl sees the boy.
It's very difficult, almost impossible, to find an apartment in Oslo.
My French is still not very good.
It happened right here.
I don't know Latin well.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
I'm waiting for my turn.
I got a lot of news.
You're not the one who died.
Would you rather tea?
I'll explain.
I'm too busy at work.
Tom asked for help.
They know you.
I've passed every test.
There's no point just waiting for something to happen; you have to do something right now.
It's an area with a lot of new houses.
I can't believe all this.
I could have left, but I didn't want to.
It was snowing yesterday.
We walked through the park.
I was in a great mood.
Tom hid a spare key in his garden.
I'm sure Tom will win.
I went out to the wrong bus station.
I only wrote this song for you.
Have you read the Holy Bible?
And if I were rich, I wouldn't give him the money.
Are we safe now?
Are you going to send this as an e-mail?
What do you suggest?
I don't have any homework today.
I was just too busy.
Did you talk about me?
The sky was darker and darker.
Watch out!
We did everything we could.
Am I ever wrong?
Come on, give it to me.
Are you blaming me?
I wish I was nice.
For some strange people, the knowledge of a language is kept secret.
I don't intend to change.
They moved slowly forward.
I survived.
Do you know how to use this machine?
Don't be blind.
It's blue.
Come visit us soon.
Were you in an accident?
Tom's worried about what might happen.
He was an honest man.
My father doesn't like football.
We're all out of alcohol.
Card, please.
My parents don't like my girlfriend.
Something was on the ground.
My friend lives a god behind his feet.
Do you think Tom would like to go fishing with us next weekend?
What are you gonna do today?
Tom looks like a banker.
That's Tom.
Tom still seems worried.
I didn't see anything.
Mary's a very shy little girl.
Tom doesn't have that kind of problem.
You can't hide secrets from me.
It just happened again.
There's a hard day waiting for you.
It's okay.
Does that mean you love me?
It's really pretty bad.
I'm not going to participate.
Is that true that Tom can't read and write?
Justice must be fully satisfied.
I'm so fat.
Let's stay inside tonight.
I thought Tom was amazing.
People don't always behave rationally.
I didn't even do that.
Did you pass the exams?
I wholeheartedly support your comments.
I'll try to convince Tom to help us.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
Have we agreed?
Let's talk in the hallway.
Can you ask Tom to call me?
We don't know for sure.
Tom went that way.
Am I safe now?
Give me the number.
I can't either.
I'm sure Tom won't do that.
Tom used to be afraid of me.
Tom whispered something to Mary and she smiled.
Can I take a look at your card?
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
It's clear.
It's your daughter's birthday today.
Will anyone tell me what to do?
It's obviously a typing error.
Your book is twice as big as mine.
We're both not as rich as we want.
Tom wouldn't be happy.
Tom has a beautiful garden.
The cup of coffee lit my head.
Do I have a knife?
It just happened again.
It's Christmas.
Tom has a missing hair.
I've seen enough for now.
I hate that.
We'll miss you so much if you go to Japan.
Tell me what's going to happen.
He lied to us.
We're trying.
Tom's gonna take a look.
Here's what I think.
I could go with you.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm kidding.
Can you turn the bomb off?
I need five more minutes.
I bet you know who told me that.
Mary used the apples Tom gave her to make apple butter.
How many poems did you write?
We're glad to have you here.
You can write in any language.
How can we manage others when we cannot control ourselves?
Don't hurry.
You can learn, regardless of your age.
He dedicated his life to the realization of a vision of what he wanted to create for himself and others.
Did you give it to Tom?
Who did you help in a short time?
Just close your eyes.
Tom's a little worried.
How is this your fault?
How did I miss this?
What should I write here?
My father bought me a book.
I'm adaptable.
Citizenship is a prerequisite for voting.
How many times have you been here?
He's repairing electronic devices.
Get lost.
I'm ready, bro.
Please shut up as hard as you can.
This fish is big.
Pass me the sugar, please.
It's nice to be needed by someone.
I hope we get this.
We all have to deal with this.
I'm not sure when Tom will be back.
I thought it was shocking.
Then our manager came up with a good idea and we made a great plan.
I just want to eat something.
I'm so tired that I can barely keep my eyes open.
Give me some sugar, please.
Come quickly!
Where'd you find the keys?
Have you ever hung a video on YouTube?
I was very interested in participating in the construction of a more intensive academic programming plan.
Just give me the money.
She's pregnant.
Don't let Tom find out.
I can't wait for Monday.
Have you been here before?
Does Tom have any experience?
I don't understand.
Come here for a second.
So what did Tom see?
I could kill you now.
Mary used walking sticks to help her climb and fall on a journey.
The compass points north.
Don't talk.
Some religious people can be very judgmental.
Whose initiative has this been done?
Finish this.
Which one shall I take?
I like cable food.
Where's your friend?
When are we gonna start eating?
The Queen and the King have reunited their powers.
I don't know why my head hurts.
I guess you already know the answer to that.
The flowers are fully intruded.
"How old are you?" "Sixteen."
I like this book at least.
Blue looks good on you.
Tom wasn't as handsome as Mary said he was gonna be.
Give me that other box.
Tom has an older brother, John.
I'd take it.
They'll know what to do.
Why'd you keep quiet all the time?
He's gone.
It was fun celebrating together.
I'm afraid I've dislocated my right shoulder.
You really need to take a shower.
What's the purpose of life?
He's driving a pole.
My right hand's slammed.
I don't know much about you.
Did you do something?
You should probably talk a little slower.
I need a beer.
I thought you were married.
It was a great success.
Sit down, please.
Does that happen a lot?
One bird told me.
I couldn't see who it was.
Crazy!
You're paying me well.
I'm glad people saw that.
You need to talk to me.
It just wasn't our day.
Take everything.
I quit.
It's all wrong.
It's all ruined.
Marriage between individuals of the same sex is now legal in 20 countries, including Ireland since yesterday.
Take this home with you.
She bought them bread.
We'll try your way.
Help yourself.
You deserve to be congratulated.
Since the message was in French, I read it easily.
Finish this.
Tom tried to answer Mary's question.
Can you give me some water, please?
It doesn't matter where I am.
Where have you been in Japan?
Everybody's gone.
I'm going to learn more.
I'm hurt.
I bought them for you.
None of us have seen Tom do it.
And you're wondering why we can't stand your company?
You wrote my name wrong.
Make a difference.
Shame on her.
I have two cats.
I already said I don't know how to do it.
His girlfriend didn't provide support.
That's not what I was interested in.
Some of them were and still are in constant danger of political repression and persecution.
I think your plan is too ambitious.
I still don't think the Internet's a place for kids.
That was hard for me.
What did you conclude?
You're made for me.
He needs it.
It's obviously a tipfeller.
Are we done?
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom was in Harvard.
She's my first love.
Have you ever seen one?
Are we safe now?
Tom's not a kid.
Check it out.
Tell her.
I'd take it.
You're my luck.
I'm waiting for the bus.
Bad things will happen.
A few trees fell over time storming in our neighborhood.
I'm sure I've seen her somewhere before.
Everyone laughed.
I didn't know you were so rich.
He refused to comment.
We're trying.
I'm giving up.
Tom looked angry.
Don't overdo it.
Oh, yeah, I'll have a job tomorrow.
Nobody cares about me.
So what's the plan now?
I'm sure they need you.
Tom's not a good worker.
I'm here to help.
I'm smart.
I think my writing's going very well.
Tom is no longer a member of this club.
That helps us a lot.
I've filled out a glass.
I'm not selective.
How many uncles and uncles do you have?
That morning Maria visited the whole village.
The sound was spreading fast.
Am I that different?
Tom pulled the keys and opened the door.
I just got here.
What Tom did helped a lot.
I've never seen that before.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Mr. Jackson is our teacher.
I'm not even worried.
It's helping.
Smoke slept with 25 men one night and then killed them.
I'm not doing it again.
I thought you wouldn't be able to do that.
We're just gonna follow you.
Tom asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn't.
Are we coming soon?
I'm not a prophet.
I hope I'm not the only one who'll be there.
Are you mad about that?
I'm divorced.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
This is why I'm very uncomfortable.
The cost will soon rise.
Was I really that happy?
Tom might be the one who did it.
That sounds familiar.
I'll go to sea tomorrow if it's nice.
Tom's gonna call.
I had dinner with her.
You see everything in black.
My car wasn't good enough.
Do they suspect me?
What are you supposed to do?
Tom likes to drive.
They couldn't travel because there was a problem.
Winter's over.
It's really that simple.
Since these papers were written about that no farmer wants to work as a tenant in Westfold, interest has grown rapidly.
I'm punished.
I have to go inside.
We're a little busy here.
Get on board.
It's really surprising.
Have you ever seen an NLO?
You're standing in my way.
It got dark.
What's the big secret?
The police are after me.
I took the first step.
I hope Tom remembers this.
We ask teachers questions every day.
What kind of food do you usually cook?
If the world wasn't capable of what it is now, I could trust everyone.
Three wounded, who are currently unclear about their condition, were evacuated to the U.S. Polish hospital.
I prayed for you.
Etherium and the battle are encrypted.
Hello, can you hear me?
We live on the sixth floor.
I'm not afraid of you at all.
Whenever I see you, my heart tells me I'm in love.
Are you all right, guys?
Will you help me?
It didn't get that bad.
Tom took the chairs to the next room.
I'm ruined.
I respect people like that.
Did you see him working?
Is that yes or no?
Don't laugh.
I'm not a bad student.
We're done for today.
He's a complete monarch.
Since the consequences are potentially serious, general precautions should be taken to avoid infections of this type of patient.
I'm a free man.
I don't like dirty people.
The room was dark.
He's going home.
That b could be weapons.
I can't fix the car myself.
I'd better go with Tom.
I was talking to Tom yesterday.
Shouldn't you be getting ready for school?
I want to feel important.
A second later, his lips turned into a vicious smile.
My mother was an alcoholic.
Mer's enthusiasm for the course fell when her favorite teacher moved away.
I don't want to be rude.
I guess you already know the answer to that.
Tom was nervous when he started a new job.
Help me.
The United States dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945.
Are you reading something interesting?
Smoking is not allowed here.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom's always very nice.
I barely got my eye closed.
Was Tom here when we got here?
Was I really that happy?
I took off the wig.
Tom won't be happy when he hears that.
Tom was named after his father.
Did he really commit suicide?
I'm going to go to sleep.
What was I supposed to do?
Don't come near my wife.
They'll know what to do.
Do you have a copy?
I wasn't really a friend.
Did I miss it?
I just want to get out of here.
Why do you think that?
Little kids like to touch everything.
She's got a hair on the bats.
He was released from military service.
My right blood.
I'm motivated.
Knowledge frees us and makes us better people.
I didn't mean to drag you.
Are we safe now?
Which one of your friends will come?
Can you hang them on me?
I've seen Tom play a lot of times.
You tried.
I'm taking you to the dance.
Tom might try to convince Mary to do it.
She's made of an elephant mosquito.
You told me not to lie.
He used to be a member of a social elite, rather than a representative of the broad masses.
I'm scared.
Help us reach our goal.
You're sad.
I'm not a rich man.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Don't rush.
Give me the pen.
Just tell Tom I called.
There's no answer to the question of what's best, because it's always individual and depending on the situation.
Tom thought Mary was cute.
Be careful.
You look like a very smart person.
I have the same desire to go abroad for a year to improve.
The house burned to the ground before the firemen arrived.
The months with the most rain are May, June, July and August.
Do I usually seem happy?
I've already written a part of the report.
I was ready for that.
Show me the document.
It has something to do with...
It can hardly be about passion, maybe it's just sex.
Did you finish washing the dishes?
The only thing I can do here.
Tom's gonna pay.
The hunting season is over.
I love the cable kitchen.
I'll start with a beer.
Thank God.
That gives me an idea.
Is Tom near?
I'm motivated.
What a tragedy!
We're here.
Knowledge makes us freer and better people.
Don't talk.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
I've almost never been home during the day.
The best parents of all are those who allow their children to follow their native talents.
I'd go.
You're very undisputed.
You let me down.
There's snow all year round on this mountain.
I don't think you should be stuck with anything these few days.
What's in nature forever, when everything's so passing?
The engine's overheating.
I'll see you later!
Without you, I feel lost.
I have to plan everything.
This may not be enough.
That's what you got.
All you have one day will have you.
No matter how busy Tom is, he never forgets to send our e-mail to his shirt at least once a week.
The dog's dead.
This is life.
Do we have one?
Is this your suitcase?
Tom stopped for a second.
Because of bad weather, the plane's late.
Investigate them.
I'm in a better shape than you.
I'm not so worried.
Come on, get up, Tom.
I think it's possible to do that.
I'll go to sleep for about an hour.
I'm pretty happy now.
He first did a preliminary test with a new electronic alcohol test before being sent to a laboratory test.
We were walking in the park.
I'm sure you're very busy.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Look around.
It was a stressful day.
Is it clear?
Are these your bags?
I don't know who they are.
Tom was looking close.
Let us help you.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't know French.
What's your job?
Let's continue the discussion.
How much am I gonna get?
I want to be with you.
This was refined and decorated in a person so strange, cruel and stubborn that a little one ventured to cooperate closely with him.
She's pregnant.
Don't move!
I could get there by 2:30.
Merauke is the easternmost city in Indonesia.
Tom often came here as a student.
We'll take the next one.
Did you do your homework?
Check everybody.
Tell us the ghost story.
Check everyone.
The session is over.
I've got a lot of things planned for tomorrow.
We need to follow Tom.
Tom saved $300.
What does she look like?
I'm poor.
I can't wait till Monday.
Come with us.
Tom's on his way here.
Tom wasn't fat.
That's crystal clear.
I'm trapped.
Cut the cheese into thin pieces or small cubes.
Have you ever had a car accident?
I'd like to start.
I didn't wear any fashionable clothes.
I'm fascinated.
Just serious questions, please.
Man, the sentence caused a real disturbance.
Give food to homeless people.
I translated the song as best I could.
He came out a few minutes ago.
I believe you're honest.
Tom wanted a bigger house than his neighbor.
Tom has an eye infection.
I'm glad we were there.
Although I was sick, I did my best.
Big boys don't cry.
I could go there now.
I need to write ten pages next Monday.
The situation was extremely dangerous; it was a question of life and death.
I've never noticed that before.
I have to sleep.
Tom usually comes to school before any other student from the department.
I'm touched.
And if I were rich, I wouldn't give him money.
Why?
"Where shall I sit?" "Wheresoever."
Wisdom is needed to understand wisdom: music does not exist for the deaf audience.
I don't want to play this game.
I knew you wouldn't be able to do that.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis match.
Troubled children are often without any guilt.
I feel bad because I lied.
I invited him.
Maybe they gave up.
That's why I liked Tom.
Tom's red.
Tell him.
How do you get rid of the mole in the garden?
It's Saturn.
My aunt gave me flowers.
I hope that's not true.
Don't stop.
I don't like it when you work at home.
Of course, Tom loves his kids.
Where are you now?
It's very likely that FIFA was poisoned to the core.
She gave me a contradictory answer.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
He's wearing a gold chain around the door.
I'm very proud of that.
Ataturk was born in 1881, in Solun.
Tom's at least honest.
I want to answer the last question first.
Did you tell Tom this?
We don't know our neighbors.
It's only five in the morning, and it's already light out.
I hate math.
What's your aunt doing?
If there is, the crossover with that will happen sometime.
Tom's a good French ruler.
I couldn't help Tom do it.
I know this is weird.
He never got over his son's death.
I'm just doing my duty.
They're all settled.
If you have nothing else to do, then the number of Greek islands.
She always wears dirty clothes.
Will that almost solve the matter?
Mary put the ring on her finger.
We've already decided not to do that.
I'm really proud of Tom.
Who's Tom?
Tom seemed older and mature than the other boys.
It'll last forever.
The top of that mountain is flat.
She laughed.
Vishnua's presents are called Vishnuanci; Shiva's gifts are Shivanci.
Tom would like to know if you'd like to come to this party.
You're growing up.
I've completely lost my mind.
I never repented of what I did.
I'm convinced.
Do you speak Roman?
Tom came to see me yesterday afternoon.
Hey, buddy!
Tom's still at work.
Did you sleep enough last night?
This must be the place.
If you're not a good girl, you won't get a birthday present.
They must have known it all the time.
"I think the ending is ugly," he said. "Somewhere in things people do I want to see scars, failures, disorder, distortion."
Get everything.
Are these your bags?
I refused Tom.
I'm not sure.
I'll probably never use this again.
I'd buy that one.
This exceeds all the limits.
Tell me where you live.
Are we safe now?
Obviously, I was a little shocked.
Don't talk.
It wasn't too hot.
I almost forgot my passport.
Tom's reading a lot.
I hope you don't talk about me.
You're good to everybody.
I'm usually not that busy on Monday.
My two sisters are teachers.
Looks like he's working.
I don't live to eat, I eat to live.
Tom seemed very confused.
I thought you couldn't do that.
Just tell Tom I called.
"If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "If not Q, then not P."
My wedding must be perfect.
Move.
We should learn.
We have no other choice.
When this is the time, it's best to sit home and not go outside.
I think Tom's hiding something.
Tom, I need your help.
During an experiment on the power of observation, Tom couldn't describe any picture of his living room wall, even though he lived there for two years.
She's pretty good.
I was definitely lucky.
Everybody's been holding their breath.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis match.
I called him.
How many calories does that sandwich have?
Are you ready to take responsibility?
I like to watch you while you work.
I hope we're going to visit Beijing, too.
You're my inspiration.
This time I refrained from commenting on my beloved friend.
I agree.
Be careful.
Did anyone call me?
We'll have lunch together in half.
I'm still a little tired.
That he strives to maximize his own interest, happiness or security seems very natural to one human being.
I can do this as a joke.
I'm not singing.
It's weird that no one knows the victim.
We're out of here for five minutes.
Sorry I'm late.
Translation is not as easy as many people think.
Tom would never admit it.
It was just the beginning.
Did you finish your homework?
Is everything okay between us?
I've never camped.
I thought the food was great.
I have to plan everything.
Let's change the subject.
We counted the years on the tree that we knocked down and found it was thirty years old.
See you later, Tom.
Do you want a fruit juice?
Let's schedule a meeting.
I upset him.
Why can't you get it?
You can't sit next to me.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
Tom still seems shaken.
Boston is a great city.
We hope people like it.
Maybe they'll leave tomorrow.
I want to show you something.
I'm remodeling.
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
That's interesting.
I'm scared.
I was happy yesterday.
I really liked Tom, too.
He loves rituals.
Nobody helped us.
I don't want to go to school.
How long have you lived here?
Get help.
I didn't ask you not to.
Tom writes a letter to his shirt every week.
He still has no experience for this job.
Can you help us?
Would you like to recharge?
Tom encouraged Mary to write about her experiences.
I could have left, but I didn't want to.
Who can't be proud of Serbia, with their historic highest achievements - the generation of heads and genocides?
Do you know you're deactivating the bomb?
Where did I leave the keys?
I'm a big football fan.
She came alone.
I can't believe you didn't recognize your brother.
Tom's lost his feeling.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
Tom'll take a look.
I wonder if anyone could help me.
I'm surprised.
Everyone laughed.
I played golf with Tom a lot of times.
You underestimate me.
I don't have a guitar.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Tom said to stay here.
We're close friends.
My friend can speak Hindi.
Yeah, isn't it great?
Where can I find a tourist office?
I'm comfortable.
I've already written a piece of the report.
Don't stop.
Please come see me tomorrow.
It was a little weird.
I really enjoyed it.
No one died... yet.
Can we, people, get the grass and get the nutrients out of it?
Why don't you play with the others?
We have three dogs, one white and two black.
Tom, this is my brother, John.
Tom wrote on the ground with a stick.
Aren't you going to have another glass of milk?
Relax!
The odds are against me.
I'll quit.
She expects us to help her.
Did I get fired?
I'm afraid you misunderstand me.
That's good.
I don't want to get you drunk.
Tell me what's going to happen.
Tom's seen enough.
Are we leaving soon?
They're selling sugar at the store.
Tom and Mary watched the sunset together.
You did a great job.
Tom does it sometimes.
Thank Tom for his help.
What did you both do?
Happy birthday!
The photographs of nature and animals, taken in complete silence and quiet, are true masterpieces.
My mother died the day I got married.
I'll never mention this again.
You don't have permission to go into that room.
We have two kids.
I think Tom's careful.
The white family will come to Tokyo in half eleven.
What did you do to me?
Enjoy.
Let me write you some steps.
Tom's probably still hiding.
Mary looks sweet whatever she wears.
Watch out!
Tom failed to give any evidence to support his statement.
Why would Tom come here now?
Are you sure this is safe?
You've got a bad nature.
I was just leaving.
I bought this yesterday.
I've had a really bad day.
The whole state is screwing up about it!
I'm not a good swimmer.
Does he love me?
Tom made an omelet.
Let's find out for sure.
I'm missing.
I was happy yesterday.
The way Mary knocked on the door, Tom realized she was sad.
Now's not the best time.
He's not a child anymore.
I'm trying to check the futon at least twice a week.
My education made me do what I did.
Tell her I'm innocent.
Wherever I go, I'm there.
You want to join?
Leave the book on the top shelf.
We could be happy here.
Tom made it himself.
Do you agree with what Tom wrote in his report?
Is that what it takes?
Take everything.
You tried.
I wouldn't hurt him.
Could you do that?
I just saw Ambassador Saudi Arabia resign.
Be careful.
Maybe something's wrong with you.
I'll drive.
Don't open that.
I had trouble solving that problem.
I don't want Tom to see me naked.
You're the most boring person I know.
Get in touch with Tom.
We've been here all day.
You know I can't give you that information.
I didn't do it.
I'll check it out.
Tom was shocked.
Just a moment, please.
We'll get you one.
Tom still seems shaken.
That's what the doctor ordered.
Tom knows what's coming.
I'm impressed.
"If P, then Q is logically equivalent to "(No P) and/or Q".
He speaks English.
I'm writing a message to Tom right now.
That's an exception.
Tom came a little earlier today than usual.
The horse could be eaten.
Actually, I've never met Tom.
What's easier?
Tom asked for an increase.
I've never seen that before.
This should work.
I've always liked Tom.
Where was Tom hiding?
What can't you tell me?
Tom bought the papers and read them on the train on his way to work.
I have ghosts at home.
Look at that.
We'll save this piece of cake for Tom.
You're funny.
Are Tom and Mary really married?
Let me try another one.
Take it easy.
I didn't do that either.
The stories of Snorius Sturluson speak alongside the others of Christianity in Norway spreading with violence.
Just answer me right now.
Make yourself at home!
The students didn't know how to answer.
I'll try to convince Tom to do it.
Am I that different?
I messed up.
I assumed you were busy.
That elegant gold chain with hearts is a necklace that will "feel your world."
Everything happened at a flashing speed.
Do we have to tell Tom?
It was raining.
There's milk in the fridge.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
You can sit next to me.
Take some more.
You're irrational.
I'm angry.
The ceremony was held in the White House.
Planning needs to be left to me.
You can avoid a lot of problems if you just do what's right for the first time.
Mary jumped into the river from the window.
The doctor's on his way.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
We all have to die.
Who are we?
Does Tom really speak French?
I'm scared.
It's great for me.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
John and Mary always walk by holding their hands.
Where was I wrong?
Tom's trying to help.
I missed so many opportunities.
It helped me a lot.
Give me another example.
Tom still has some time.
It's boring.
Tom was more than generous.
I was just delaying.
I'm sure it wasn't intentional.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
We're lost, aren't we?
We're not gonna let you die.
Did you go see Tom?
This is the beginning of a new era.
I don't have a card.
Nothing happened.
I baked apple pie.
He's got a good reputation.
You can't sit next to me.
Are you coming soon?
Everything's different.
The truth must be true.
Look how much it is!
We have to go shopping.
Tom's in the garage, working on his engine.
Are Tom and Mary really friends?
Tom wanted to have a bigger ship than his brother.
Tell me what it is.
Let's hope Tom's smart.
For breakfast, I always eat fruits and nuts.
Who would want Tom dead?
Tom made us know he didn't want to work for us.
I'm happy.
I'll stand.
We suggest that water quality be checked once a year in pipes, twice in a well.
Dear God, it's really hard for people to pay attention to one thing or another about you, your attitudes or your looks, for example.
What did you say?
Tom could've done better.
I'm sure they need you.
I feel like I've been thrown into a lot of trouble.
Do you agree?
Don't be afraid of the dogs that bark.
Are they still there?
Tom hasn't written to Mary for a very long time.
"Yes, orange juice, please," said Mike.
I'm not going with you.
Be careful.
Could I just stop you for a second?
The students didn't know how to answer.
It's a good intention.
I've been thinking about it.
Stop trying to blame me.
I'll live.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
There was nothing to eat.
The girls were asleep.
I'm just looking.
Do you want to know something specific?
We're not sure.
We don't have any food.
Interoperability is compatibility with other systems.
I love you, but not like that.
I have no idea.

My mother's not like other mothers.
He canceled the meeting at the last minute.
What do women want?
Tom said you were cool.
She received four e-mails.
You're opening the door.
That's good.
Who's Tom?
Get dressed.
When did you start writing songs?
I don't know why Tom went to Boston.
Why did you do that?
I hope you don't talk about me.
How did I miss this?
I'm relaxed.
Have you seen my dog?
Tom told me he was gonna do it.
Look again.
I'm objective.
Nine out of ten voters believe that Maria is the most suitable candidate for a new leader, but Tom will not vote in this election.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
I probably don't want to read Tom's report.
I agreed to buy it.
I'm Tom's grandfather.
Make a place.
Tom's very well known in Australia.
Be careful.
It's cold today.
My mother is a Greek.
Be careful with your wishes, maybe they'll come true.
Tom's a third-year-old student.
Who's gonna come with us?
Sounds like you've learned an important lesson.
We've never been separated.
I've got 30.
Give me back my bottle.
I'm really happy to be here.
At that point, it exploded with a big crack.
That's exactly what I said would happen.
Tom knows that more than 91 per cent of the Norwegian population are supplied with drinking water from surface sources.
What's she drinking?
Tom's very rude.
Don't forget to write a date.
Clear this mess.
Could you read that?
That's perfectly normal.
It's said a new restaurant was built.
The price of this book is five dollars.
Can you keep secrets?
I assumed you were busy.
When the fire broke out, he slept a lot.
I never thought of that.
It's quiet down there.
Tom explained in detail, but I still don't understand.
That wouldn't like it.
I was really curious.
Tom was double-parked.
Good morning.
Are you sure you're ready for this?
What are you gonna do with Tom?
There was nothing to eat.
Tom signed the bill.
There are islands on the sea.
I've never had trouble sleeping.
I didn't see anything.
Any other options?
The amount of work done and interest in capital invested were several million.
I can't wait tomorrow.
Is coffee good for you?
You never know what's going to happen tomorrow.
How many books do you have?
I'll do it myself.
You're sad.
All three boys were laughing.
We're all tired of this.
I need to drink something.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
I don't fully agree with you.
Do you keep this place for someone?
How are you these days?
Sunday is seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
I wasn't worried about that.
Will you come to Tom's and Mary's wedding?
He asked me to help him.
I'm coming back late.
They're up, they're up, they're up.
Tom said he wasn't an expert.
No, don't do that.
I asked Tom what he was reading.
There's no reason to panic.
He didn't even hear Tom hate us.
I don't want any beans.
It's been a long time since I sent a letter to anyone.
What's the difference between imitation and real diamonds?
I don't want to grow up.
Tom turned the engine off.
I was just thinking about you.
Don't argue.
Did you write a report?
Tom didn't want to talk to Mary, but he didn't have a choice.
Can you go, Tom?
That man is a soldier.
Do you have Facebook?
Tom's working around nine hours all the time.
I hope I can do that.
I told you Tom was busy.
You're welcome.
They couldn't all hear what Tom said.
I'll take a shower.
We have four hours of French every week.
Let's start right now.
I can't imagine doing that.
I've been training for months.
I know what you're probably thinking.
It's our only hope.
I got up on my left foot today.
I didn't know you were so rich.
It was a presentation that could be published.
Let me show you why you shouldn't do that.
Tom didn't practice.
Thank you so much!
Keep the kussur.
It's fifteen to two.
I think you should do the test again.
Why would Tom give up?
Europeans took advantage of other civilizations 500 years ago.
I pray for your family.
I can't remember what I ate yesterday.
It's never here in the morning.
Even kids know that.
Don't make a fool of yourself!
That makes me very angry.
Is it still light out there?
I'm not hiding from anyone.
There's a lot of birds on the edge.
I don't have a cell phone anymore.
I assumed you were busy.
Do you agree?
I recognized him at first sight.
That's very nice of you.
I wish it had come to my mind.
Tom managed to get into the house through the window.
I saw the sword.
I saw the sword.
Paris is snowing.
I hope Tom comes back safe.
Can you laugh at Tom?
I'd better clean up now.
You tried.
Don't leave me alone.
Wow!
I'm sure Tom won't do that.
Tom is strict or fair.
Are you free this afternoon?
The three of us ate some potato salad.
Come alone.
I didn't tell you to do that.
Where are you from?
I promised.
It's not a simple sport.
Their friendship quickly turned into love.
Don't be a coward.
I eat lots of meat.
Tom's a nerd.
The future seems dark to Edmond Dantes, since he became the victim of a conspiracy, he was sentenced to treason and sent to prison for life.

Can you let Tom know I'm back?
She did what she was told.
I'm bald.
You need one of these.
Can you cook?
Tom loves sports.
I learned French myself.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
Tom's thinking the same way.
That's his weak point.
You're one of us.
He's in the grave with one leg
Tom just told me the opposite.
Louder!
I'm compassionate.
Tom's unhappy.
That'd be fun.
He's crazy as a power guy.
What do you know about me?
I'm reformed.
All the songs I sang to you today, I wrote.
That doesn't scare me at least.
How old are you?
Tom asked me if I even slept last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?
Tom seemed a little sick.
I'll contact you as soon as I get there.
Nice to meet you.
This place looks quite different from what it was before.
Why are rabbit ears big?
I'm a runner.
I want to help.
I know how to do it.
Tom sent his son to bed without dinner.
Tom is really an idiot.
Come see us.
He lied to us.
That's a pretty big problem.
I'm watching you.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
That's very rare.
What did I just do?
It's best to handle things in a walk.
This one's really cool.
I really enjoyed it.
I bought a lot of things.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife's from Keda.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
That helps us a lot.
What do you believe?
I'm sorry I even tried.
That river looks flat, doesn't it?
I can keep a secret.
Tom helped me write this composition.
We hate Tom.
This one's really cool.
Tom cut the tape.
This isn't that fun.
That's a big secret.
Mary said she'd reveal the secrets of all her bosses if they didn't raise her salary.
"Will you think about it?" "Yes, I will."
Get out of there.
Is any of this true?
I had a vision.
I'm cold.
Please wait a minute.
I don't want to do that!
I'm tired of arguing.
What was your day?
What am I looking for here?
She's a singer.
I like to watch you play.
I was definitely lucky.
What was your first song ever written?
Tom could get in the way.
I just want to get away.
Don't let it get away with this good chance.
Be careful.
He's in his first year of college.
I've been looking for grape juice.
I was thinking about my family.
Can you smile at Tom?
My fluid knowledge of the language is enough for many situations, but not for expressing my, often mutually contradictory, emotions.
Turn around for a second, will you?
The book's on the police.
I often feel a heartbeat.
Tom's on a secret mission.
I don't blame you.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm afraid of a snake.
I know that girl from somewhere.
I've cleaned up once.
I'm sorry to bother you all the time.
He's a man of power.
Beautiful!
I'm glamoury.
Can you pick us up?
Can you make it in time?
It's weird that the mailman hasn't come yet.
How do we prevent this from happening?
I hope Tom remembers this.
Was I really that happy?
I'll buy a boat soon.
Tom said he wouldn't be waiting for us.
Close your eyes, Tom.
Have you ever been punished for driving fast?
I'll be right up.
We have to go.
Tom's a very good boy.
Tom's on the floor.

The results were incredible.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember your name.
The brakes are shrunk.
Have you completely recovered?
I'll listen.
Tom was talking very loud.
Don't move!
It was an accident. It was an accident. It was an accident.
Did I miss it?
This is the stupidest thing I've ever said.
I wish I knew Tom didn't speak French.
Tell them we're coming.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.

Look what it is!
The living truth.
You're very undisputed.

Now is a great time to buy that.
He knows the names of all his customers.
Tom got out of it.
Tom got involved with people he should never have gotten involved with.
Tom's been visiting us from time to time.
Tell me what to write and write.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
That's the problem you have to solve for yourself.
I was too big.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom dropped the book.
This is supposed to work.
You don't have to judge a man according to his appearance.
It's disconnected.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thanks for the e-mail!
I guess I don't know what's going on.
They'll hold speeches tomorrow.
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea I was gonna be there.
Tom told me he wouldn't tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
The team is as strong as its weakest member.
I've already been there.
It's different than what I expected.
Don't lie.
What are your plans then?
The kids are sleeping.
You need a temporary bridge.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
Tom closed the door.
It wasn't fun for me, so I went home early.
Now it's time for the kids to go to bed.

Phase one is over.

Tell her.
I volunteered.
I don't see the difference.
Don't hang up.
I used to not like anyone.
The brakes are scratching.
Find Tom.
You really made me proud.
You see everything in black.
I'm a little worried right now.
Do you have a stable relationship with the boy?
Tom still knows he's quoting a song he wrote when he was 13 years old.
Did you see Tom left?
Be careful.
How would you translate that?
I'm willing to pay you well to do that.
That was a tough decision.
This is from Australia.
I thought you'd be busy.
He's got a lot of surprises.
I hope tomorrow's gonna be a good time.
Let's sit down.
Come and look.
Tom really seems familiar.
Do your kids have their own rooms?

Go swim with Tom.
He's safe.

There's nothing you can do but admire his courage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom's been working his whole life.
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom that.
Tom will live.
You win!
That's a bad sign.
I got it wrong.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.
My mother died the same day I got married.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Am I really so happy?
I'm good with kids.
I'm gonna be late.
You can't buy apples anymore!
There's a lot of traffic on the highway.
You should leave a message to Tom.
You're always lying to me.
Just in time!
Tom now has a family.
That doesn't surprise me.
Sweet dreams!
Somebody needs to hire Tom.
Where'd you find the keys?
You'll see her.
You're very rude.
Can I call you in 20 minutes?
No matter how little we know about her origin, at least we can be sure she's the pilot of the Gospel.
I'm a terrible writer.
Tom got on the bus.
Jelen is faster than stronger.
People used to write books with typewriters.
I was reacting instinctively.
It's a toilet.
Tom doesn't see anything wrong with letting Maria learn to drive.
Are you coming back now?
I hope not.
How could I hate Tom?
You're wearing this.
How barbaric!
I've always known that.
Tom thought I was you.
I'm happy with your letter.

I wasn't convinced at all.
Never say.
I was in the competition.
Did you eat anything?
France is in Western Europe.
I hope Tom stays here.
Flights land at the airport.
That's all your wisdom!
Tom was wearing a black hat.
You did what you had to do.
Tom always seems unsatisfied.
We're out of money.
I think everyone's overeating.
I'm very happy about that.
Tom turned around to go.
I'll never mention this again.
Let me show you where to put that.
Why didn't you let Tommy talk to Maria?
Wake up at seven in the morning.
What would I do without you?
I think Tom will be able to help us handle this.
I'm already paid.
They're all forgotten.
Did I call you?
Come on Tuesday, if possible.
We need to be realistic.
Don't stare.
They accidentally heard some suspicious activity in the spaghetti, indicating that the bear smelled their food.
I was all over Europe.
Can I help you, sir?
Don't look.
You asked for it yourself.
How is this your fault?
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Come to my neighborhood.
I don't want to live with you.
I'm broken.
Tom's in constant pain.
The other girls in Mary's department were laughing at her for her clothes.
They're all either past or they're going through it.
I'll get on it right away.
I'm broke.
Tom and Mary enjoy a walk along the hiking trails in France.
Tell Tom I'm innocent.
Can you help me translate these phrases into Chinese?
Did you watch?
Are you busy here?
I'm a choice between two options.
We got what we need.
Everything else is irrelevant.
Did you have a good look?
Tom asked me to wake him up at half past seven.
We didn't do that.
Did you wash the court?
Please, give me them.
How's Tom doing?
Be careful.
Do you have a paper I can write on?
He was walking down the street.
Do you agree with that?
We just had dinner.
I'm sure they need you.
That's good.
You're one of us.
Do you have a dog?
I saw the cat.
I've been there before.
Tom's book is at the top of the Christmas Book Sales, and it's hard to get it out of position.
Tom works for Mary now.
I'm armed.
Is it necessary to make such a gala?
Did you wash the court?
Give me another reason.
Let's have a drink!
I assumed you were busy.
Are you dyslexic?
If only I knew.
Get dressed.
That's all I could find.
A large group of people gathered.
I'm working on my project.
Everything's well-prepared ahead.
I don't count on it.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
They gave the water to their horses.
I'll give you everything you want.
The girls wore grass skirts and had flowers around their neck.
I'm not feeling well.
Tom's the only nutritionist in the family.
Maybe he's already gone.
You're wrong.
This could take weeks.
You can format and configure a table for cross budgets, insert and use regular tables, diagrams, formulas and functions.
I'm staying at the Hilton Hotel.
Which one of you will come with me?
Call me anytime, on my shoulder, you can always cry.
I'm reformed.
What's next?
Doctors are still trying to save Tom.
No one believed her.
Detectives are still investigating.
Tom was fine.
This sad story was written when Tom was in exile.
Tom's not like the other boys.
We'll take the stairs.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis game.
Do you have anything to say?
Get changed.
We should have brought another bottle of wine.
Men want to feel wanted.
She tried.
You don't mind, do you?
How would you feel if you left your wife?
Can you prove that?
Corsocoa.
It's easy to write with this pen.
Are you ready for more?
This pen doesn't work.
Did you see me play?
I'd rather not be involved at this point.
Tom closed the fence.
I had dinner with him.
I really hope I'm wrong.
Are you busy here?
Tom used to play the guitar.
I'm actually a nice guy.
That's what they both like.
It must have been awful.
I'll lend you a job note if you promise me you won't write anything about it.
My friends live in the same house as I do.
There are a lot of bad people in the world.
Did Tom find it?
Are they in love?
Where do we meet tomorrow?
Tom saved Mary.
Latin is the language of the future!
I think everyone's ready.
You'll see her.
Tom has a dark secret.
Did you eat anything?
Let's get this straight.
The stick is a very interesting bird.
The relationship between the person and the blood group has not been scientifically confirmed.
I thought you were married.
I'm singing.
It's Tom.
I've checked some things.
I'm not singing.
I'd like to kiss you.
The kids are playing outside.
Are you coming soon?
Did you manage to do that on your own?
A working group dealing with data transfer, led by Ben Manij, will hold a meeting on 14 January 1999.
Some say that if you hit a rainy slope, it'll start raining.
At first it's my end.
I just got here.
Stop trying to make me guilty.
What am I supposed to see?
Did you decide what you're gonna do?
Tom knows he's knocking very fast.
Are we all here?
I'll be right back with your order.
My sister plays with dolls.
Identify yourself.
Take the money.
I'm saving to buy a new saxophone.
Don't give up just like that.
I'll give you what you want.
Who did you write a letter to?
Maybe I'll need some help.
Does this mean you don't love me anymore?
I'm not a specialist.
I'm more brilliant than I look.
Nobody's here.
Tom's youngest daughter is his favorite.
Tom bought the papers and read them on the train.
I won't be home next week.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
That would be OK.
What do you call that?
How does Tom know French?
I like to see you while you work.
Answer me right now.
There's no established policy.
Write down what I'm saying.
The rain finally stops.
I live in an old house.
Do you love your mother?
It was a big explosion.
Tom pointed out.
I didn't step outside today.
Did they tell you why?
Can you spell me your name?
Look at this.
She saved her head alive.
I think we should call the doctor.
You're in a terrible hurry today.
We caught Tom at work.
We need to be realistic.
She took off her clothes.
Tom's house is for sale.
Tom wasn't satisfied with the results.
I hid under the table.
They hold me hostage.
Maybe Tom wasn't hungry.
I've already been there.
Tom asked Mary how she liked her new job.
I'm a big football fan.
What are you planning on doing with all this?
Mary earns a living by sewing.
Can you give me some water, please?
Where's your friend?
I don't know what to think about this.
I don't like it at all.
Tom's used to winning.
Elementary, my dear Watson.
Tom's not sure what he wants to do with his life.
We've come for you.
I'm instigated.
What do you want?
Medicines should not be mixed with alcohol in general.
Did you see who it was?
When I woke up, the snow fell.
Some people don't lose their beauty no matter what time they are.
I played golf with Tom a lot.
Don't talk.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis match.
That's pretty extraordinary.
Bad things will happen.
Why would Tom come now?
I panicked.
Come on, try it now.
We'd better get inside.
Actually, I'm not sure.
Investigate her.
She was dressed in red.
What does a Soviet scholar study?
It's all a big joke.
Tom was talking about music.
Have you completely recovered?
We had a hard fight.
Tom's still hiding.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't know French.
Keep working.
Hope loses when you experience a difficult situation and a pointless impatience, you have to be strong.
I was laughing.
The new constitution will not solve the problems of Egypt.
Solar energy is pure from energy output.
I thought Tom didn't do what he had to do.
I'm not lying to you.
Did you see me dancing?
Did you eat something?
Tom's not in any danger.
It's so easy.
All men are the same.
Is it clear?
They haven't woken up yet.
It's all free.
Welcome.
We have no other choice.
I've never really been anywhere.
He keeps losing his cell phone.
I'm angry.
I'm thinking about going to Australia, too.
I'm sure Tom will win.
Are the Americans really that individual?
You can go play with your friends when you're done preparing the house.
That's my problem, not yours.
What's your specialization?
I'm twice as old as Tom.
You're the love of my life.
Tom couldn't talk to Mary, and he couldn't influence it.
And now that I remember everything I've ever experienced, I've really learned a lot.
I wasn't too surprised.
The team is as strong as its weakest member.
I've never camped.
There are a lot of dishonest people in the world.
Don't yell.
When was the last time you heard from Tom?
Hungarian language isn't easy, but it's wonderful.
That's what I think.
I prefer a tent with a storm cover, along with the cross-arrows for wind stability and snow showers, and this must be a two-layer tent.
Tell Tom to say hello.
I can't be something I'm not.
Where are we going to meet?
Do you think what she said was a lie?
Tom didn't do it.
I'm touched.
Tom's fired.
Are you planning on going to Tom's and Mary's wedding?
This candidate is much better than his predecessor.
Don't call me while I'm in the office.
Thank you for loving me.
The doctor's questioning the patient.
Tom put his drink on.
This is a lacdy of justice.
I could lose my pension.
She's in a bad mood.
I've always known that.
Don't be blind.
Every communication is a translation.
I'm trying to be careful.
I'm really happy about that.
I've never been camping.
They believe in God.
Everyone's the owner in his house.
Let's hope you're right.
We grew up on the corner.
Are you angry about that?
I've made my tongue.
You tried.
I thought I could trust Tom.
When there's no news, it's good news.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
Is that what happened to me?
Did you sleep?
They tried hard in court.
Is there a reason you're keeping these old bottles?
We talked for a while.
Now I have to go.
Can I take your dictionary?
No one else was hurt.
We need to try.
That fabric isn't from India, is it?
I'll buy what I need tomorrow.
I may be antisocial, but that doesn't mean I don't talk to people.
I believe you're honest.
I didn't choose anything.
Let's try something.
Are you in Paris?
Don't leave me alone.
Tom started studying French last year.
Tom was sitting on a bench all day, writing postcards.
Aren't you going to eat anything?
It's abandoned.
Don't move!
I've already thought about it.
The money's talking.
I hope Tom remembers this.
Tom told me his father died.
We have to spend less!
I parked twice.
I've never seen that before.
Do you want to live in Mumbai?
Tom broke something again.
Tell me where you live.
You have to teach me these days.
I love this store.
I just didn't go looking for you.
He's leading a filthy life.
I'm not a rich man.
I really like your music.
That's what I'm used to.
Tom's got the right attitude.
Anatomical implants for the breast, however, can also lead to deformity of the chest if they rotate on the side.
Where'd you find the keys?
I won't tell anyone you did it.
She tried.
Tom was a little confused.
I saw the bus.
Tom's smart enough not to do anything like that.
I brought these reports to give you a more detailed look at them.
I'm not as rich as we want.
Get on board.
Tom's still mad.
Why are you still awake?
Please don't make me eat that.
I think your work is very good.
Tom helped Maria put on her coat.
Have fun while you can.
The Internet is not your own army.
I could go with you.
Regrettably, he has moved from Almighty God to become a powerless, dirty, small and insignificant man in the corner of a small province in a vast empire.
We should do better.
The weather forecast says it'll rain tomorrow afternoon.
Tom's a real gentleman.
I saw a snake.
It's useless.
Which planet are you from?
Are you listening?
Am I in love?
Wait, wait, don't go yet.
Did you eat anything?
Give me another reason.
What did you two do?
Is this your first exam?
Life's on the move!
Tom's already here, but Mary's not here yet.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
Okay, we made a deal.
Let's not be emotional.
Tom is very patient.
Everything changes.
Tom knows where the wind is from.
Women are the most beautiful thing in a man's life.
When you get your phone, the battery is fully charged.
Tom knows that now.
I volunteered.
Shut up!
Tom likes it the most.
Tom's driving me crazy.
This famous actress was also a fashionable icon.
I'm not moving to Boston.
I'm impatient.
Yesterday, I finished studying hopefuls at Duoling.
Tom attacked Mary's sister.
Am I safe now?
We'll get to work right away.
I did what I could for him.
I'll just say, you're beautiful.
Are you allergic to any food?
Tom's listening because he's convincing.
My suitcase's not packed yet.
Did you sleep?
The readers were in pain, waiting at least three months before they got the answer.
Do you know anyone who passed the last year's exam?
Mary took a free ride.
They live on a high leg.
Tom came out of the limo.
I'm sure I've seen that guy somewhere.
I'm surprised by Tom's answer.
I'm buying a lot of stuff in that store.
You don't really support me much.
What's he drinking?
You'll see her.
He's everything. He's just not fair.
I'll call her on the phone tonight.
The police asked the criminal to hand over his gun.
It's human to sin, it's divine to forgive.
I've put all the tests.
I just needed a little time.
I have to go.
Please be honest with me.
Tom knows it's hopeless.
What's that?
Man dreams, God determines.
Tom was wearing black pharmacies.
Must have been fun.
What do you have to say?
That gives me an idea.
Did you just meet them?
It's more art, not science.
Is this place busy?
That's exactly what it was.
Add more water.
Tom's counting the kush.
All the parking space is full.
This is my brother, Tom.
You use the device until it alerts you to charge the battery and then fill it in for 5 hours to achieve maximum capacity.
Tom's still a groom.
You're becoming obnoxious.
No, don't do that.
I had houses when I was a kid.
Tom was with the girl, but he couldn't see who he was.
I don't want to ask Tom to do that.
They were all standing.
I thought I didn't understand.
Would you like to talk to Tom?
Can you give me a remote?
Why are you leaving?
Now's the time to enjoy.
Did he meet his goals?
I just want to go home.
Tom's upset about this.
Have you seen my house?
I have a book.
What do your kids usually do for breakfast?
Am I that different?
We had a terrible fight.
Tom's a salesman, too.
I'm twice as old as Tom.
That's exactly what I said it would happen.
Testing the new engine will take place today.
Come and sit down.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
I'll apologize.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
Tom wants to repay the money he owes.
All things have to go through.
Come on in the truck.
I've never seen that before.
I don't have a desire for that.
I think Tom was great.
I have a headache.
Tom looks a little nasty.
I loved it when my wife could cook.
I'm proud of my family.
Men have about 7 to 8 times more testosterone than women.
I have to go.
It was a good hat.
The door's stuck for something.
Tom left right away.
I had lunch with her.
You've taught me so much.
What's bigger, the sun or the earth?
We'll get you one.
No doubt!
Looks like you've wasted ten pounds.
You disappointed me.
We'll get on it right away.
May I ask why?
I bought this yesterday.
You did a great job.
The security's overheated.
Are we safe now?
Tom says one day he'll do it.
Otherwise, what's your address?
This one's uncomfortable.
She wears a gold chain around the door.
The electronics ensures a multi-stage and simple adaptation of air flow.
Have you heard he finally came home?
During the dark days, we see Mount Fudy in the distance.
That's your choice.
They're sitting at the table.
It's a multi-phase process.
I think you've been very generous.
Tom might have something to do with it.
Are you dyslexic?
It doesn't work for me.
The assembly is disbanded.
Tell me what you wrote.
I never thought anyone would come up with something like that.
Tom was friendly to me.
I can't agree with you.
My father fixed the broken chair.
Let's move the closet.
Tom dumped me at the airport.
You know, don't you?
I'm trying.
I wrote a song about Daddy.
I need to catch the train.
I'm not rushing anywhere.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
That's all I needed.
Let me try.
I paid for it.
I bought a new hat at the store.
I wouldn't hurt him.
I have complete confidence in you.
Have you ever heard such good music?
It's okay.
I think you'll be able to do that.
Stop it, will you?
He threw the ball into the goal!
It's a big day today, son!
We were filled with a cheerful expectation.
It's just a personal attitude.
I'm really sorry, Tom.
Did you tell Tom this?
My older sister is very talented to sing.
I'm sorry, but I won't forget.
I always thought it was weird.
Clear your lips with salve.
The free Haskel and Opera House libraries are built on the border between Canada and the United States.
It's very important to rest properly.
You let me down.
You don't have to eat right before you go to bed.
Karin is an Austrian.
I think I understand you.
Tom's personal assistant has a personal assistant.
It was sitting alone.
You have to make a decision.
Every time we talk, he makes me an adrenaline.
Tom's always very nice.
This takes courage.
I have no intention of answering all the questions.
Tom stood up to the pain.
Stop smoking.
Do you know what that thing is?
Just tell Tom I called.
I'll try to convince Tom to do that.
Did you tell Tom that Mary did this?
They gave water to their horses.
My father gave me a lot of money.
You can talk to Tom.
Is all this solved now?
Nothing's free.
Vladivostok is a city in Russia.
You should've been my friend!
I wasn't too surprised.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
Did you write a report?
Tom turned on the heat.
I want to know why.
We'll get you.
I don't usually buy anything from the Internet.
Someone was here.
Did you write in the diary today?
That's the best thing I've ever heard.
Do you know anyone there who speaks Urdu?
Tom was shot three times.
Come pick me up.
Tom smiles suffocatingly.
Are you sure this thing is safe?
Tom could have explained that.
Let me help you.
Are you a baseball fan?
Why are you mad at me?
I haven't seen anything.
We have all received a blessing for the blessing of the Almighty’s grace.
No matter how much you've considered, I still don't understand.
Tom's thinking the same thing.
I never borrow books or CDs.
That was kind of weird.
I don't have a lot of friends.
My children rely on me.
I beg you to reconsider.
He can heal.
Don't cepide.
When they experienced the French Revolution, citizens became free people, freed traditions and churches, praised freedom, equality and brotherhood.
I thought it wasn't appropriate.
Tom offered to help when it seemed that everything was going completely wrong.
Translated or not a moral selection of translators, things sometimes sound better if they stay the way they are in the language in which they are created.
Look what I grew up in!
I'm not sure when Tom will be back.
It's necessary.
What did you do now?
I'm poor.
How long have you been living here?
Do you think the situation will improve?
He doesn't risk it, he doesn't get it.
Don't stare.
J. Kepler, an astronomer and a mathematician, did research on planets and their movement.
That's enough for today.

I could help.
She was caught at work.
I think I know how to save some time.
That was disgusting.
It's a completely unique friendship that's been deepening for many years.
Okay, I get it.
What are you looking for?
Are we all here?
Scientists believe that discovery always comes as a thunderstorm from the sky.
Who's Tom?
The ship's in the middle of nowhere.
I agreed to buy it.
It came from nowhere.
They know you.
Let's go one by one.
Don't yell.
The ship disappeared without a trace.
It's accurate.
I've never seen that before.
Did you enjoy watching the night game last night?
Their proximity was mysterious, given that they only met three days ago.
That's what I've already done.
What year was your car made?
I tried to be nice.
Don't sing.
It would be good if I put on another layer.
What did I say, brother?
The keys are in the locker.
That's all we can do.
Are those your new shoes?
By what name?
Why don't you take off your coat?
Where the hell have you been so far?
She laughed.
Tom just couldn't do it.
I thought you were married.
I'll go if you go.
Well, I've got some news.
The odds were against me.
I want to be with her.
What I saw was discouraging.
Did you tell Tom that Mary did this?
You tried.
Thank you for loving me.
I'm a big football fan.
You make Tom nervous.
Keep working.
There are a lot of bad people in the world.
I thought you were happy here.
I'm natural.
I don't like dancing.
Don't forget to send this letter.
Nothing happens if he doesn't have a dream.
I tried to be nice.
Tell him I'm innocent.
Tom is very good at imitating Mary's way of speaking.
Can you solve this problem?
Some of my friends smoke.
You're my princess.
You're gonna miss everything.
Come on, sit down.
Tom's gonna wait.
Looks like Tom thinks so.
Don't let Tommy sleep.
Come down here.
Excuse me?
Everyone changes.
Would you like some more apple juice?
We can't lose hope.
Let's sit down.
Buy a litre of milk, and if they have eggs, buy twelve eggs.
Tom wants to know if you're planning on coming to his party.
Did you see me play?
Why would Tom want that?
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
Tom is very idiotic.
I'm hurt.
Keep digging.
I don't want any evil.
I was the only man in the tourist group who made the rest of the Arab women who lived in Istanbul.
Investigate it.
Tom's not the right person to work.
We need to get better.
They asked for an increase in pay.
Let me see your prescription.
Tom came to help.
Sometimes it's a trap between families that spreads through generations.
Everything's wrong with him.
Tom thinks fast.
Comments have to be related to the subject.
Don't get fired.
The programme sets conditions for the development and implementation of projects.
We should go again.
Do you feel okay today?
We won.
Give me the spoon.
Can I find you on Facebook?
I was trying to be kind.
It'd be confusing.
We're here.
You can sit next to me.
That's what he pulled his hand.
Tom was a great manager.
They're all turning.
All you have to do is practice.
Have you ever sucked a cow?
There's a lot of orange peaches on the river.
You just need to write a few sentences about what you did yesterday.
I couldn't get on the train because there were so many people.
Could you please turn the radio off for me?
Come back.
She's walking.
Why are you still awake?
Tom was a scout.
Why are we this mess?
Tom counted the cosura.
I studied hard while I was at school.
I refused to do it.
Should we tell someone?
After five hours on the hot sand, he saw something on the horizon that looked like a desert fatam organ.
When are you gonna get to the station?
Are you honest?
We'll try your way.
Are you a maniac?
I'll be better now.
And that's it for you!
I made an apple pie.
Are you a prisoner?
Nobody's been watching.
If you have to be somewhere right now, it's definitely here!
Tom could be lying.
Good luck.
I've never repented of it.
Tom was as angry as rice.
Tom might have a point.
Did I welcome you here?
What did you both do?
Don't fuck around.
What an experience!
Tom's learning to program.
Are we done?
Tom's a little eccentric.
Mary came back from school in tears because her friends were teasing her.
I trusted you with my secret and you betrayed me.
I'm writing too fast.
We all did it.
Maybe you're wrong.
I'm sure you'll understand.
I have to pay off the debt.
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
His speech was, well, a disaster.
We need to save money to buy a new car.
Bad things are gonna happen.
I thought you'd already taken care of it.
What year is your car?
You have to believe it's possible to change.
She translated her sentence.
Did you even ask Tom to serve?
I could go there now.
They were all cheering.
Tom said you were cool.
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
I'm glad you answered.
Drive carefully.
Let's see.
Do you have a perfume?
Don't play the monkey!
Mary's a little attractive.
He makes such a grammatical that you want to hit him.
Be careful.
You understand me.
Tom wanted to know what we were doing.
When yelling doesn't help, yell louder!
I think you should talk to Tom about it.
Tom came in time despite the storm.
Something wasn't right.
Tom said I was rude.
Tom wanted to take Mary's phone number, but she refused to give it to him.
I'm begging someone to do it for me.
You're still untasteful.
We'll have a great time.
It's not bad.
He asked me to help him.
It's hot here.
Have you completely recovered?
Tom was wearing black jeans and a white shirt.
The book cost five dollars.
Is it that simple?
Tom's not like the other guys.
Listen to this.
How much is that worth?
I was lucky to have survived an accident.
No one I know goes there anymore because there's a big crowd.
I'm learning Korean.
I'm losing.
I don't want to see him anymore.
I'm glad Tom left.
I'm buying a lot of stuff in that store.
Drive slowly.
Tom must have had the key.
Why is that interesting?
Are you involved in this?
I'm sure Tom didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
You're the reason I came.
Tom probably hates me too.
You can sit with me.
Oh, gray cat, please, don't give up so he can hear you.
Just give me a chance.
What's your mom smiling at?

Can we order now?
We can't stand here.

Hey, give me a chance.
There is also an ethical question that has been raised about this.
It just happened again.
They all survived.
Bad things will happen.
Do you love your mother?
I'm really proud of it.
This is my third marriage.
What did you do here?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom's a little worried.
I totally don't agree with that.
It's a routine thing.
He's trying.
Good evening.
Will anyone tell me what to do?

Did you go see Tom?
I was looking for you.
I'll go by car.

I thought you were going on a Boston bus.
Tom still has some time.
Maybe I won't sleep tonight.
Just waste your time.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
How many pairs of socks do you have?
I've never had trouble sleeping.
It's locked.
I'll figure something out.
An honest man can't do that.
Take care!
I won't try to predict the future.
What are you doing at this time?
I'm early.
Are they all strong?
Is everything worked out now?
Please send me the doctor's account.
What's this about?
I want you to have a good day, Tom.
Are you going to Tom's and Mary's wedding?
I'm a little new in this.

That's what they both like.
You and I need to talk.
You've been spying on me.
The pen I write belongs to Tom.
Where'd you see Tom?
It's time.
What's this gonna buy me?
Wake up!
We help each other.
Tom and Mary are still good friends.
How did you do that?
I won't tell anyone else.
How do you know so much?
Tom suffocated his smile.
I'm scared.
What name?
Is Tom really a student here?
Tom is the one who wrote this story.
Everybody's going.
I didn't spend anything.
It's an area with a lot of new houses.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Tom seemed pretty nervous.
Tom likes sports.
Tom took off his wig.
It turns out I'm right.
Her name was unknown.
I'll get Tom ready.
Don't come near my girlfriend.
I'm sorry I even tried.
I'm not bitter at all.
Jumi is one of my friends.
He just needed some time.
I thought you wouldn't do that.
I'm sorry I'm so late.
Mary started taking off.
The worse and the lower.
Life without love doesn't make any sense.
I'm sure there's a better way to do it.
I'm strong against this.
You underestimate me.
Tom almost never makes mistakes when he writes in French.
The police didn't reject the possibility of suicide.

Tom missed his goal.
I totally disagree with you.
Get out of here.
Let me do it again.
They live there.
This book will help you write effectively.
Don't talk.
Tom made a fool of himself when he was drunk last night.
I work in Milan.
Come back in a day.
There was a lot different effect than the intended effect.
I'm surprised by Tom's answer.
Everybody laughs.
I liked going to the beach.
Where's your father?
I'd agree.
It's all over.
The book was sold out.
Tom almost died trying to save me.
That needs the truth.
I liked going to the beach.
At first glance, it looks easy.
It's time to say good-bye.
You should have been my friend!
People should stop hating.
I don't doubt he'll make it.
I never advised you to do that.
I'm not going to change.
Tom started the car.
My grandmother's enjoying her father's tea ceremony.
She laughed.
They all cheated.
Are you coming back now?
Tom kept it as a secret.

You always do.
There are situations in which a figure is sacrificed to gain advantage over a long period of time.

You haven't finished yet?
You're not the one who died.
It's hard to imagine.

She's walking.

Tom put his drink down.
I'm pretty shocked by this.
Spice's empty.
Tom's decided to "opposit."
I'm grateful.
I couldn't do this without your help.
Don't answer.
If you would do that for me, it would do a lot of good.
It was bare breasts and boobs.
Tom might be honest.
Can you explain to me how to get to the airport?
Look again.
The first step is always the hardest.
They have to drink water.
Now I'm a little worried.
What's in there, Tom?
Help yourself.

I know it's illegal.

Everyone was asleep.

Would you like to come with me?
Tom's family lives in Boston.
I liked that one.
Al lived in the Soviet Union, the large and multinational, in the large Tver region, by the same size as several English countries.
Tom could be dangerous.
Are these your bags?
What did you do to me?
Don't jump!
When he was six years old, he taught him to knock on the writer's machine, and he told the teacher he shouldn't learn to write with his hand.
I've been practicing.
That doesn't sound very convincing, but I believe you.
I think I'm gonna go out and eat.
Can we talk outside?
You have good instincts.
I thought I was playing well.
Am I safe now?
Please write.
We didn't have this in mind for you.
Tom's selling the car.
He started screaming.
Tom was clearly shaken.
Did you see who it was?
I didn't know you were so rich.
I'll never see her again.
Everybody down!
I could talk to Tom.
Do you believe in God?
We kissed last night.
Was I really that happy?
Tom never had to do that.
You don't often hear that someone bought a hat for a thousand dollars.
Come here.
That's what I'm used to.
Do you doubt me?
Tom's been working his whole life.
What language do they speak in Mexico?
That's what they both like.
Something's come up.
Help!
I already ordered it.

What's your name?
Where did you get that?
Tom's a really nice kid.
I can't concentrate on this mess.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Swimming is a kind of exercise.
The government fell after the vote in parliament.

We don't know what it brings tomorrow.
What's the first instrument you've learned to play?
I'm amazed.

How's it going?
Don't argue with me.

I want to feel important.
We'd give everything so it wouldn't happen.

Switzerland needs better apples.
Are you involved in this?
Everybody's standing.

I'm objective.
I'll leave early today.

He's not a doctor.
That's enough.
How many instruments can you play?
Employees can be motivated by good, fair wages, a chance to work in a good team or on exciting tasks, and with clear economic incentives such as bonuses and opportunities for progress.
I doubt I'm the only one who noticed.
That's encouraging news.
Hand me the sugar, please.
I'm really sorry about this.
You're funny.
Merry Christmas!
Have you ever seen one?
We had a lot to drink.
It's too loud for me here.
I doubt it'll be hard for you to get a driver's license.
Did you manage to do that yourself?
Is everything worked out now?
How could mathematics, which is still only the product of human thought independent of experience, be so amazingly adapted to objects in reality?
Look at that.

I didn't know you were so rich.
Look at this.
The code is Muriel.
I was having lunch at the speed.
That's what he risked.
His wife put on his shirt.
Someone told me about it.
Suck your pride!
To change the red meat, I cooked the turkey's breast in the sauce from the oven for tonight.
I'm always hungry.
Tom fights like crazy.
I always liked horror movies.
Something just came up.
I couldn't stop crying.
You've grown up.
They're not mine.
Double the price.
Could you do that?
A video of the interview was made and published on the Internet.
Tom was drunk and drowned his grief after that one night of drinking.
Why don't we just take a break?
Go check it out.
Tom just wanted to say something.
It's over.
Is it true that Tom killed himself?
I'm here to play baseball.
Do you think so?
I didn't even do that.
Do you have anything to report?
I say that all the time.
Don't lie.
Will you take that?
It's just coming.
Is Tom coming back?
You're smart.
How did I get here?
Why?
Tom dropped his suffocated breath.
There's a lot of work I need to do before I can go home.
By the way, where do you live?
Do you have any questions?
It's hard for me to understand French when it's spoken fast.
It'll be about three.
They'll know.
Tom bought a few black shoes yesterday.
I have a lot of friends.
Cyrus is considered one of the major financial centers.
That's very rare.
Tom wanted to be good.
I'm just not in a hurry.
Don't look.
How desperate are you?
Let's not get out of here.
It's not getting any worse.
Answer me.
I'm still making mistakes.
Tom's got a hard job.
I'm glad we won.
You can't go into that room.
"Is it better?" "No, it's worse."
It's all transitory, but beautiful memories are alive.
I was in the mountains.
It's hard.
What's easier?
Did you wash the dishes?
We had a hard fight.
It was the drop that poured the glass.
He doesn't like us.
We'd save the time to get down through Park Street.
The cop arrested him for driving in a drunken state.
We're gonna be crazy.
That'd be great.
The knife's not sharp.
We hope people like it.
We all have a price.
That gave him an idea.
I'm lucky.
Nobody knows me in Boston.
Tom thinks something's wrong with some politicians.
Where's Tehran?

What's fast is a piece.
Come sit next to me.
I found his book.
I barely managed to hide my resentment for her stupidity.
Butter is made of milk.
There's nothing we can do about it.
Everything's better.
You want to see something?
I miss her.

Let us help you.
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
Please don't stare.
Is there still a temperature?
Tom was crazy, you know.
Tom put the map on the table.
Who are you running away from?
What did you do to me?
I'll talk to Tom about this.
I'm still a little tired.
We can't go back.
We'll visit you from time to time.
Tom didn't have the courage to do what he wanted.
His comment is easy to understand in the wrong way.
Are we meeting tonight?
