From my point of view, the literature programme was formed by women of the Balzakov age on the basis of their interests.
From the Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred the Danish and Volconian.
They wrote Belletrist, of course, from the same point of view as Balzakov.

Matras Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195.
Micropackage Prestij model: comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different strengths: the medium-hard surface is formed by latexed coconut fiber and natural latex, moderately soft, a plate of natural latex.
A spring block of 1000 spring per square metre is quickly adapted under the sleeper’s body, warning of the effect of “voltage” or “gamach”.
Among the dignity of the model, breathing materials must be allocated.
Latex, perforated for air perforation, is excellently ventilated in a natural way, as is the coconut.
This maintains a healthy microclimate of the sleeping space.
An extended warranty period shall also apply to mattresses.
The period of official warranty from the manufacturer is 5 years, in effect the time limit for the operation of the mattress.
The protection against dust and contamination is placed on the gecko's back of the gecko set.
Buy an orthopedic pillow in pairs to the mattress – it is recommended to maintain the optimal position of the dial during sleep.
The filler determines the designation of the sides – the coconut serves anatomical support for the back, the latex relaxes the muscles.

Germany: The Fourth Influenza of the Crown Virus Unavoidable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final but will continue with new strength.
Despite an active campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of coronation vaccine will likely not be sufficient for full protection.
In this he was convinced by the Director of the Association of Doctors of Common Practice Ulrich Weygeldt.
This is what Die Welt reports on Saturday, 11 December.
"We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, at the latest in the fall," he said.
In addition, Weygeldt hopes that the fourth coronation vaccination may be carried out “in combination with influenza vaccination”.
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination can help to combat the spread of the new strain of the micron.
The new version is particularly dangerous.
So, the probability of re-infection of Omicron three times higher than that of Delta or Beta strains.
This is demonstrated by the results of the preliminary study conducted in the IPR.
Based on this, producers of BioNTech / Pfizer plan to provide a vaccine adapted to Omicron by March 2022.
Companies stress that the two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new version of the Crown Micron virus.
The BioNTech and Pfizer study showed that the effectiveness of two doses of the vaccine is significantly below: “neutral potential is reduced more than 25 times”.
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against micron-stain infection," emphasized BioNTtech and Pfizer.
Therefore, a third dose is required.
Experts insist on accelerating vaccination rates in the country.
For example, the President of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernd Zalzberger, advocates the reduction of the interval between the second and the third exposures.
More than Zalzberger believes, the accelerated vaccination will have an impact on both the delta virus and the coronary micron variant.
"Israel's experience is very convincing," stressed the expert.
Vobler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
Bet-A-Vib Series is a special Bet-A family line from Pontoon21®.
She (as well as the Kalikana Vib series) is different from many of the other challenges, which were originally created with a reference to the use of the underfish, not only for the catch.
These outbreaks are greater than those near the Analogue Bay, which undoubtedly has a positive impact on the nuances of the application of these interesting traps.
Another characteristic is the upper float of a durable and immediate plastic, which produces additional vibrations in vertical and horizontal lines.
As “winter vibe” when caught in relation to Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a rather aggressive game.
Often the most catchable is a simple monotonous animation, i.e. the movement of the fan up and down almost without a break.
When planning a deviation from the vertical axis, it is not very large, which is convenient for fishing in a restricted area that is hampered by underwater vegetation, reefs and other obstacles for which a trap is possible.
In addition, there is a slight variation in the winter of the judge and the big shark, especially in the middle of the winter, when precise and aggressive baiting is required.
At the end of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib suddenly turns and returns to the baseline.
At the very least, Bet-A-Vib has been successfully applied to the winter forage.
You can choose from two modifications to suit her capricose: with or without the sound capsule (NS-NanoSound) (SL-Silent).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib is able to irritate a passive hook that doesn't even react to live.
The length and accuracy of the Bet-A-Vib catch is demonstrated.
This wobble is understood and not capricious, is well combined with forested and woven strings even with large diameters.
In order to catch, there were hooks, storks, herrings or storks except for an evenly current and "step" sometimes with a "shark" at the bottom.
If you're hunting in the corner, you can turn the front triangle into a double, which will reduce the probability of the traps.
Among the acceptances of its Bet-A-Vib class among the most sustainable in the work and, as a result, one of the most catchable.
With the same success, it can be used both in relatively small and fairly deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

In Libya, 7 thousand Russian mercenaries declared
In Libya there are more than 7,000 private military company mercenaries (CHVK) in Wagner.
This was stated on Sunday, 12 December, by the President of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Khaled al-Mishri.
"There are currently more than 7,000 WAGNER VAC mercenaries in Libya."
They also have planes.
They're also rolling trenches in Sirte and Koufre.
They have 30 reactive aircraft at Gardabia (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte), " says Anadolu.
Khaled Al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are "trying to capture" the central part of Libya, extending from Chad to the Mediterranean, after "bringing their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Keeping the presence
In the opinion of the interviewer, Moscow sought a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and “founded in Libya”.
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using the airbase and port in Sirte, as well as the airbase in Jufre, is noted in the Agency's publication.
The Russian authorities officially deny that Wagner's CVC is supported by Kremlin.
Where else can there be mercenaries?
According to the agency, Wagner is allegedly operating in nine African countries - the CAR, Libya, the Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiaries are granted certain privileges and licences for the use of mined and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technology and military services to these countries," says the article.
According to the media, "wanderers" allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, the Sudan and the CAR.
This group is neither in the force offices nor in the juridical register, and its combatants are not in the formal lists of personnel.
This company is under U.S. sanctions.
Remember, earlier 27 EU countries have approved restrictions against Wagner.
This decision is expected to be adopted by the Council of the European Union on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme Council of Libya de facto is the second House of Parliament with consultative functions with the dominant Islamists in it, TASS writes.
The body has repeatedly called for a one-day vote on the elections of Members of Parliament and Heads of State from 24 December to at least February 2022.
“The elections remain for less than two weeks, and there is a sharp decline in the chances that they will be held in time”, notes the material.
On this background, the Supreme Electoral Commission of Libya has postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates for an indefinite period of time, broadcast by the Sky News Arabia television channel.
Foreign policy with Russian eyes
38 per cent of Russians see more success than failure in their foreign policy, and 29 per cent believe that failure prevails.
"Successful examples - "were protected in Syria, restored peace there," "Northern Stream-2"" "the whole world is afraid of a cruel weapon," "We are sorry for the crime."
The main failures are “conflict with Ukraine”, “confrontation with the Western countries”, “peace isolation”, and “public opinion” are said in the Fund's study.
The Government of Dubai has completely rejected paper production - all co-services have also become only digital
The Government of Dubai reported a complete refusal of paper production and the transition to digital technology.
All public services will also be provided exclusively electronically.
This is reported by the WAM Emerate Information Agency.
"Today marked the beginning of a new phase of digitization of all aspects of Dubai's life - we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government," said the successor prince of the Emirates, President of the Dubai Executive Board, Sheikh Hamdan Ben Muhammad Ben Rashid Al Maktum.
The internal and external exchange of documents in all Dubain agencies will now be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
Innovation has affected all sectors without exception: health care, CPC, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures have also joined the Government initiative.
The transition to the electronic government and the digitization of the document began in Dubai since 2018.
At the time, according to the authorities, 336 million papers have been saved, accounting for 14 million hours of human labor and $353.8 million in cash equivalent.
Former mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobianin, said that electronic services would save citizens 2 days a year.

The production and export of Turkish cars fell below the 2020 level
The production and export of Turkish cars fell sharply in November in the light of the lira undercutting.
As a result of the 11-month industry, last year ' s performance was worse, Bloomberg reported, referring to data from the Turkish Automobile Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, in November Turkey, 115.000 vehicles were produced, which was 20 per cent less than a year earlier.
Approximately 75.9 thousand vehicles were exported, with more than 25 per cent declining last year.
And if, as a result of the first 10 months of this year, Turkey ' s car sector had shown a positive trend by last year, by the end of the 11 months of 2021, the issue of cars was already 0.3 per cent worse than last year.
This has resulted in a sharp decline in the Turkish lira rate, which fell by 29 per cent compared to the dollar in November.
This has led to a fall in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 ISB subjects received a delay in credit payments in 2021
The first Deputy Prime Minister, Alihan Smailov, described the situation of granting small and medium-sized business benefits, reports MIA correspondent Kasinform.
“In accordance with the instructions of the Head of State of 1 April 2021, the President of the Agency of 9 April 2021, No. 127 “In order to approve the deferral of payments by small and medium-sized enterprises,” wrote Alihan Smilel in his response to the parliamentary request.
He recalled that the arrangements for deferral of loan payments provided for the deferral of loans by banks and microfinance organizations to ISB entities, including IP, from 1 April to 30 June 2021.
The deadline was between 30 and 90 days for the selection of the ISB.
The borrower's application could specify a different period of payment.
During the delay for the borrower, claims and claims were suspended, a notice of the need to settle the debt overdue, as well as the taking of commissions and other payments by the creditor," said the plumber.
In 2021, second-level banks received a loan delay of 603 ISB borrowers, from which 553 ISB entities received a delay of 9.7 billion.
The IMF has submitted applications for a suspension of 131 ISB entities, of which 95 have been granted a delay of 105.8 million tonnes," said A. Smile.
Pulmonologist Purassev suggested that people with weak immunity can easily carry the strain "Ommiron"
The doctor suggested that people with impaired immunity can carry it more easily than those with a strong protective reaction
The Pulmonologist Sergei Purassev explained why the strain of the crown virus "Ommyrone" might be dangerous.
The cause should be sought under the conditions of the birth of the virus.
Scientists believe that Ommiron was born in a body infected with HIV or with immunodeficiency.
I mean, he didn't find any immunity resistance during the mutation.
This makes him more aggressive.
Because there was no immune response, it became very fast.
Apparently, there's these spike-belts, spikes, maybe more than they're supposed to be, their antibodies didn't cut during the mutations, says lung surgeon Sergei Purassev.
The doctor suggested that people with impaired immunity could carry “Ommyrone” more easily than those with a strong protective reaction.
Turns out the body's strong response to something, to any infection, isn't always good.
In such cases, the organism may kill itself.
That's what happens when a 30-year-old dies from pneumonia, and a 60-year-old in what he's wearing.
The immune response was given to the young man, he was totally inadequate: where only a finger could be threatened, he beats like a rifle on the wolves, locked up Sergei Purasev.
The doctor also recalled that the coroner has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Inflammation of the lungs is bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case, only symptoms can often be bought - all hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the start of organ poisoning — temperature, weakness, inability.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, first throat, cough.
Pain on the right or on the left, abdominal pain may also be evidence of the developmental problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, a growing generation from 12 to 18 years of age may begin to be vaccinated by the end of the year.
The virusologist, director of the laboratory of the genomic engineering of the MFTI Pavel Wolfkov, noted that this category is very actively suffering from copper.
For adolescents attending school, the maximum number of contacts.
This is the most socially active breakthrough, as did children's garden educators, said "Moscow 24" Pavel Wolfkov, a virusologist, director of the laboratory of the genomic engineering of the IMF.
The author is most grateful for this article.
I was happy to refresh the memories...
Teath-in.
In those far-off seventy-eighty-one dance venues, none of them went without the tunes of this group.
And at home, together with friends, danced under their music.
Immunologists have suggested why people with obesity become victims of copper
The authors examined the fatty tissue left behind by bariatric operations and found that fat cells known as adiocytes could be infected with the coronary virus.
Immune cells located in fat tissues, macrophages, were also infected, showing a strong inflammatory reaction.
Researchers have also studied the fat tissue of patients who died of copper and found particles of coronation in the fat that surrounds the organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can be hidden in the fatty tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to avoid immune system responses.
This is probably what SARS-CoV-2 can do.
The biologist described the causes of dementia
The candidate for biological science Semen Golosheykin called the causes of dementia and described its methods of prevention in the Sputnik radio interview.
According to WHO, over 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is a gradual loss of cognitive functions, and in time, it is difficult for a person to be guided even in a familiar environment.
Golosheykin noted that the most common cause of dementia is neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and the lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of disease development.
These include hypertension, diabetes, increased cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
The role of social isolation and the lack of active cognitive activity at the level of behaviour is possible," he said.
Dementia also affects harmful habits such as smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and low-life lifestyles.
Among the first signs, the expert noted the forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and lower the level of abstract thinking.
"There is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risks of its occurrence," added the biologist.
To prevent the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the required level of fitness, training cognitive skills and skills required to involve memory and logic.
Former professor of neurology, neurosurgery and medical genetics of the FGAU in their RNIM.
N.I. Pirogova, head of the Cognitive Disorders Division of the Federal Centre of Brain and Neurotechnology, Anna Bogolepova, reported on the causes of memory problems.
Egypt has returned about 30,000 illegally expelled from the country
In the past 10 years, the Government of Cairo has been able to return to its homeland some 30,000 artifacts that have been smuggled out of the country illegally.
This was reported on Saturday, 11 December, by the Chief Inspector of the Department of Returning Ancients of the Ministry of Tourism and the Ancients of Egypt of Shaaban Abdel Wayad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian State has been able to restore 29,300 artifacts.
Only this year in the Bible Museum in Washington were 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization found," he said.
Abdel Wayad made it clear that all smuggled by means of artifacts were registered in archives.
Department officials are now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts are “tracking auctions around the world and online sales” through foreign and Egyptian sites, as well as social networks.
The Chief Inspector said that cultural values were restored upon return and then displayed in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts has become an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities asked Interpol to help find the auction budget of Pharaoh Tutanhimon in London.
The Christie's auction house on July 4 held auctions at which a budget of over 3,000 years old was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This was a cause of discontent on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the object of art was illegally taken out of the Carnacas temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutanhiman, represented by the sun god Amon, has been stored in a private collection and has not been placed on the market since 1985.
The way the relic came to Europe is unknown.
Egypt has been actively repatriating illegal exiles in recent years at various times.
According to the authorities, 95 per cent of the anti-trading ancients are the result of the archaeological discovery of black miners.
The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account - and that's right, because the Crimean Tatars (232.000) are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you would like to add, only 42,000 people live in Crimea.
Crimea Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people is two words!
Only the Turkish language group unites them.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to personal mobile staff
Credit Suisse requires its staff to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, says the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not issue corporate communications to its employees, instead proposing a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone by a telecommunications operator partner.
Under the current rules, the bank may view information on corporate devices issued to its staff, as they are used to deal with business with colleagues or clients.
The Bank enjoys the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases, for example, if it is used by a staff member to meet with a client who has not been approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many staff members have moved to a remote mode of work, the bank wants to extend this rule to all the devices that have been used to deal with working issues.
According to the newspaper, the management of the bank has set a deadline for staff members to familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergey Esenina's life, 1925, was fruitful in terms of creation, but more difficult for the earthly being of the poet and his "ego".
He's already out of any literary associations, he's drifting around with imagination, he's on his own, but he's known, he's been sued, he's sometimes strongly criticized, even malicious, but the public is ready to carry him on his hands.
Over 60 verses were written a year ago, many of them are the masterpieces, completed the cycle of the Persidi Motives, written by Anna Snegina, published 8 books, the collection of the Russian Soviet.
At the end of June 25, Gossizdat concluded a treaty with Esena to publish its compositions in three volumes.
None of Sergei Aleksandrovich's modern poets were so honored, he was the first!
In addition, it was very good money - the fee was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (for example, 300 rubles per month, engineer - 200).
The funds were needed that year as never before.
Esenin married Left Tolsto Tolstoy Tolstoy's grandson, had to establish a family home, had to contain Sister Kathu and Sasha, as well as mother.
Life would have been a source of joy, but for him everything was decorated mainly in dark tones, as if it had materialized a nightmare from the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published already after the death of Esenin):
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Does the wind whistle?
(They will be) on the surface of the wilderness and in the desert.
So, like, in September,
He's choking his brains out of alcohol.
Many well - known people have noted that Essenin has given up a lot of bad looks that he is obviously ill.
There are more and more loopholes, nerve fractures.
And the reason probably isn't just alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis is alcoholism, Sergei Alexandrovic has been put on someone, there are no reliable documents left.
For example, as of May 1923, when Essenin at the insistence of the fourth woman, the Americans of Isedora Duncan repaired health at a clinic under Paris with Professor Peter Gannuškin (remaining to Essenin two years later, already in Moscow).
And here's the evidence of the poet's booze, the scandals on this ground, the causes of the militia are still scattered by dozens of memoirs.
Since the beginning of the 20th century, the fearsome novel of the poet with a green snake has evolved rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Essenin settled briefly with a friend, the materialist Ivan Starzov.
Surprisingly, at his very poor income, Esena never had her own home in Moscow or in Peter, but she had her own home in funeral homes, in hotels, or in famous ones.
The old man remembers:
"He came only at night, and in most cases in an unchangeable, drunken state.
Once, coming back at four o'clock in the morning, Essenin fell on the walkway...
Falling, he scratched his face and his throat.
When he came to himself a little, he started coughing all the time, cutting off all the simple blood..."
Yes, Essenin himself after the war on Europe and the United States (there was a dry law in the States at the time, but Duncan accepted a proper supply of alcohol):
"I didn't see anything out there except the cockroaches and the streets...
I've been through and people have stopped remembering...
Well, he was drinking, of course...
And I drank because the bag was bitten."

Why did the girl cry at the exam when she hasn't broken it yet?
Why didn't he tell his daughter that it wasn't a school?
She'll have a tail.
Well, what?

MID Poland believes that Belarus uses migrants as "arms" against the EU
Mid-Polish believes that Belarus uses migrants as “arms”
The Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland Pavel Yabloński expressed the view that the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, had used refugees as “arms” against the European Union and intended to return to such “operation” next year.
The relevant statement of the MIDI prison was made in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to Yabloni, sanctions against Belarus were temporarily "stopped" by Lukashenko, but he "was actively seeking new ways".
The Polish official is also confident that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons “in many parts of the world”.
As kp.ru wrote, the European Union had previously put into effect the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He touched 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, there has been a willingness to continue to expand restrictive measures against the Republic “if the situation in the country does not improve”.
The Minsk responded by introducing a food embargo on a wide list of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

In the world's 2021 events, bartenders were dominated.
Well, the first one who made his new fashion decision was Daniel Craig.
In September, at the premiere of the film "No Time to Die", he appeared in a bartender-man's pajaque and a traditional "bondish" grandmother.
Following his example, Prince William twice gave the award ceremony of The Earthshot Prize, a non-conforming royal dress code, a green bartender pizza, and then selected a more classic option for the event in support of the Royal Variety charity fund.
A few weeks ago, the trend was similar to that of Lionel Messia.
The football player came to pick up the 7th Golden Ball in Dolce & Gabbana's bartender.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same way.
AliExpress has already noted the growing demand for men's bartenders in Russia.
According to the service analysts in the Gazette.Ru, they started to buy them in 1.4 times more.
The most popular hot bartenders with a floor and a tight silhouette, the main colors are dark-flight, board, dark-blue and, of course, black.
The average price of these models is between 3,000 and 6,000 ribs, while men prefer to buy exclusively pajamas - sets of barbaric costumes they choose to cut.
You can buy them not only from online retellers.
Budget options are available in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
The luxury pijjaki segment of this season is represented in almost all brands - and Brioni, and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is the model Gucci, in which he went to one of the premieres of the "Dom Gucci" brand ambassador Jared Leto.
By choosing the pajamas of expensive brands, you can be sure that the barrel is made of silk.
Due to the special interfering technology, we produce welded fabric with an external texture and a smooth inner side.
More budget options are made from a boy or a polyamide, but therefore serve less.
The fashionable expert Lamoda Ilya Wahoschkin warns that in the case of a bartender, the main thing is not his model or his façade, but his propriety.
"Barhat requires evening light, so such a pizza is ideal if you come together for a party or a celebration," explains Wahoschkin. "He will also come if the invitation specifies the dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie".
Another important criterion that allows the choice of a bartender to be made is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a bartender's pajamas, first of all, must be able to handle the right push-through with enough, according to Telegram-channel authors about the man's fashion "Brammel." The owners of bartender's pajamas usually belong to the caste of people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to the world events, where the dress code is always mentioned.
Ilia Wahoskin proposes to combine the pajac from the barchat with the same things in order: classic shorts with arrows, uniforms, shelves, pocket Loffers, and buckles.
Too simple and everyday things will look inappropriate.
Modern experts from Krasavčica Brammella are confident that it will be inappropriate to have a bartender's pijjak on the corporation, and that if it is "the leader of those who run the event, it will be "yes" to him.
If the employee is below the rank and his aim is to move higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to get out of the financial bonuses, it is best not to put up a bartender.
The guide will accurately evaluate it with the phrase “not on the shadow hat” – the telegram-channel editors consider male fashion.

The whole thing is money -- alternative energy is well lobbying, that is, getting paid.

No, the price of electricity has increased.

Perhaps if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole car, they will not sit down, at least.
But only because of the mental distress and ignorance of such "beautiful" people, but not because of their outward appearance.

The immunologist stated that 4-5 months of revaccination would help to protect against the strain of the “micron” crown virus.
Revaccination after four to five months can protect against the new strain of the coronary infection “micron”.
This statement was made by the immunologist Nikolai Krüčkov, who called the visit six months later, taking into account the emergence of a new strain, “very long period”
"In the past generations, this was a normal time, but now it is best to conduct the procedure five months later, and people with chronic diseases - four times," the expert said, in parallel with the usual campaign, to undertake revaccination.
Kručkov also noted that early revaccination provided a good title for neutralizing antibodies.
"If a man has made two eyelashes and a booster, or he has overcome and vaccinated, or he has vaccinated and overcome, he has received "hybrid immunity," i.e. an antidote to many and neutralizing enough," said the expert.
"Greater September" warned Russia of the "scale effects" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine
The major seven countries (United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France and Japan) issued a statement on the outcome of the mid-caps meeting in Liverpool.
It stresses that Russia ' s “military aggression” against Ukraine “will have enormous consequences and will be expensive” in Moscow, but no specific measures are described in the document.
“We, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of the Russian military power and the aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine,” says the statement.
Ministers further call on Russia to “weaken the escalation, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations with regard to military transparency”, as President Byden of the United States spoke during a video call to President RF Putin on 7 December.
“We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the normative form of achieving the full implementation of the Mining Agreements with a view to resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine”, the Foreign Ministers of the Great Seven also say.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine would have enormous consequences and a serious price in response," they warned.
We reaffirm our firm commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign State to determine its future.
We welcome Ukraine's position.
We will intensify our cooperation on our overall and comprehensive response," the statement also said.
Earlier this day, the head of the British diplomat Elizabeth Trass stated that Russia would be subjected to “serious consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, the meeting showed “one voice of the Great Seven” countries, which accounted for 50 per cent of world GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine would have enormous consequences for Russia.”
Pfizer vaccine was 32 times less effective than micron strain
The efficacy of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against coronary micron strain 32 times lower than the rest of the disease.
This is the conclusion of scientists from Hong Kong University and Hong Kong China University, which transmits South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was considered less effective on the basis of an antiviral activity study in subjects who received two doses of COVID-19.
“We see that most people have had a high level of anti-virus activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 option, but this capacity has been significantly reduced against micron-diversity,” said Professor Malik Pearce.
However, scientists have stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the serious flow of the disease in the event of coronation.
Previously scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the crown virus pandemic, taking into account its impact on the micron-stamp.
The authors of the study concluded that micron strains could cause a new wave of virus circulation and increased mortality if no additional measures were taken.
The head of defence of Ukraine accused the FWG of blocking NATO arms shipments to Kiev
The head of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, Alexei Reznikov, accused the Government of blocking the acquisition by the former Chancellor of FRG Angela Merkel of Kiev ' s deadly weapon within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on 12 December, Reznik recalled that last month, Germany had imposed a veto on Ukraine ' s procurement of anti-Sniper systems and rifles for the defeat of unmanned pilots.
It is noted that Berlin later softened its position with regard to the rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defence, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the above-mentioned weapons under bilateral agreements with the allies.
In particular, it is the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania and France.
In the meantime, FT notes that the position of the new German Government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz regarding the permit to supply arms to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier this Sunday, the Ambassador of Ukraine to Germany, Andrey Melnik, expressed the view that Kiev should not expect Berlin to supply weapons at the office of Chancellor Soltz.
According to him, the previous FWG leader explained his refusal to provide arms at the risk of developing a military escalation of the conflict in Donbass, despite the “occupation by Russia” of the Ukrainian territory.
The same “unreasonable” position as the diplomat is sure of, Germany will remain with the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelenski said that Kiev was expecting assistance from Berlin in the marine fleet.
In Ukraine, it is expected that Germany will “be a technical partner of Ukraine”, the President added.
It was also noted that in the spring of the current year, the Co-Chairman of the Green FRG Robert Habek visited the Republic where he was selling defence weapons to Kiev.

"Messedes" protested Gran Pri Abu-Dabi
The German Mercedes team, whose pilot Louis Hamilton at Granpri Abud-Dabi finished the second follow-up to Red Bull by Max Ferstappen, protested the outcome of the race, reports the Formula-1 press service.
Mercedes believes that the rules of Formula-1 were violated at the time of the take-off 48.12 and 48.8.
In the first case, the German team challenged the decision of the judges to return to the rounds with the leaders.
According to the second, Ferstampen beat Hamilton to the authorized "restart" zone.
Let's add that the Gran Pri Abu-Dabi result, according to which Ferstappen beat Hamilton for 2.256 seconds and won the Formula-1 Peace Championship, is preliminary when the Mercedes protests will be considered unknown
G7 warned Russia of responsibility for the invasion of Ukraine
Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the G7 warned of “serious consequences” for Russia if it continued military aggression against Ukraine, as indicated in the party statement.
The meeting also noted that it condemned the strengthening of Russian armed forces at the country's borders.
“Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine would have serious consequences and serious costs”, says a statement published on the British Government.
Ministers of the G7 countries and the EU High Representative noted that “they are united in their condemnation of Russian armed forces and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine”.
The mid-cap of the United Kingdom, Elizabeth Trass, at a press conference in Liverpool, warned of the “great consequences” for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We made it clear that any invasion would have significant consequences...
G7 wants Russia to refrain from aggression against Ukraine," she said (Tass quote).
Earlier at the Liverpool Summit, the Foreign Ministers of the G7 agreed that it was necessary for the parties to return to the negotiating table to resolve the crisis due to the rise of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine.
It was about negotiations in "Norman" format.
The North Atlantic Alliance also spoke for the dialogue on Ukraine in "Normand format".
The representative of the Russian MID, Maria Zaharova, said that, urging Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 “was unable to take responsibility for their own mistakes”.

Open ways of returning stolen via online money stores
There are several ways to return money stolen through the Internet and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were launched by information security experts in an interview with the RBC.
Thus, to reduce the risk of major losses in the occurrence of bank card data in the hands of abusers, it is recommended to keep basic funds on the map or bank account that are not used for online shopping.
Part of the stockpiles may be deposited in the savings account and removed as necessary.
Experts also recommend establishing a separate map for online purchases.
If money was stolen in stores that did not use 3D Secure protection technology, a return procedure could be initiated.
“As part of the rules established by payment systems on unauthorized transactions carried out without 3D Secure, responsibility is placed on the participant in a series of calculations that do not use this service”, said the representative of the Promsverzezbank.
The expert from the international payment provider Ecompay Artur Zaremba stressed that the buyer had the right to lodge a complaint to the bank not later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the offender used a card on online resources that did not require two-factor authorization, the transaction could be countered and returned.
It is noted that, in some cases, Internet stores themselves return the funds to the client if the order has not yet been sent to delivery.
On 19 November, a member of the Public Chamber, Director of the Ekaterin Mizulin Security Internet League, reported that only 11,000 cases of fraud had been reported in 2021: from the sale of counterfeit documents to the theft of personal data.
In her view, an effective solution under the current circumstances could be the establishment of a single window for complaints against online fraud.
School arrived in Poland to discuss North Stream-2 and EU legislation
Germany's newly-elected Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw to negotiate a crisis with migrants on the border with Belarus, independence of the judiciary in Poland, the development of Russian troops on the border of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian pipeline "North Stream-2".
Although Scholz has expressed his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unmistakable expectations.
Prime Minister Mateus Moravecki, Polish Prime Minister, said that he would call on the School to speak against the North Stream-2, on which Russian gas is expected to be delivered to Germany to Ukraine.
According to Moravec, Russia could use a gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland ' s efforts to stop the flow of migrants seeking entry from Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Warsaw and Brussels deal with the crisis.
Poland ' s judiciary, however, remains one of the reasons for the disagreements.
The European Court of Justice fined Poland, finding that the judicial reforms carried out by the right and justice party violate EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its Supreme Court ruled that national legislation had priority over EU rules.
Despite the demands of Poland and the United States, the new Government of Germany, which has taken an oath on Wednesday, has not undertaken public commitments to stop the work of the North Stream-2 in the event of an invasion of Russia into Ukraine.
US officials told Congress members that they had reached understanding with Germany about the stopping of the pipeline if Russia entered Ukraine, a high-ranking U.S. Congress official reported on Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm these communications, but Scholz on Wednesday warned of the consequences if Russia violated Ukraine's border, and this position was confirmed on Sunday by the representatives of the Great Seven.

Minors want to provide writers with residences
The future Russian Literature Support Fund will be transferred by the State to the Federal Property that remains to be inherited from the USSR Writers Union and the USSR Literature Fund.
Written residences will be based on it, reported the Parliament newspaper in Mincifra, which will become the founder of the fund.
Minors prepare a draft presidential decree establishing the Support Fund for Russian Litersaries.

Our money in the church wall will pay $20,000
A Santechnic who found money in the church wall in Texas, U.S.A., will pay the prize.
This is reported in the non-commercial release of Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place in the great Evangelical Church of Lakewood, where pastor Joel Austin preached, promising that godly Christians would be rich and prosperous.
In November 2021, Sgt. Justin Coley repaired one of the church's toilets and found thousands of packages of money and money under heating.
He handed over the church and said that he did not even receive thanks from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could do," he quoted the CCPR TV.
According to the opinion, the finding is related to the theft that occurred at Lakewood Church seven years ago.
At that time, about $200 thousand was lost in cash and $40,000 in the form of cheques stored in the church safe.
The money was secured, so the church did not suffer loss.
However, a $25,000 prize was announced for information on criminals.
Justin Coley couldn't claim that amount, because the time for the award has already expired.
Despite this, the non-commercial organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, in its time, awarded five thousand dollars and later received another 20,000 dollars in a gift from the Lakewood Church, decided to reward the honesty of the architect.
He'll get $20,000.
Earlier it was reported that the police had questioned Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in Lakewood’s church wall.

In Brazil, citizens were obliged to submit a passport of vaccination upon entry into the country
In Brazil, they had been obliged to demand a decision by the judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) Luis Robert Barroso.
This is reported by CNN Brazil.
From the presentation of a certificate of vaccination, citizens who have objections to adjudication are exempted.
There are also exceptions to the list of persons who have come from countries where there is no vaccine.
“The situation is even more serious if it is taken into account that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, Pre-Carnal, Carnival, and other activities, which entails an increase in the traffic”, said Barroso.
In the past, Brazilian authorities had forced unaccompanied tourists to observe a five-day quarantine.
A comprehensive protection scheme from COVID-19 has been developed
A virusologist, a doctor of medicine, a worthy Russian scientist named Anatolie Altstein, in a conversation with Ura.ru, has discovered a comprehensive protection scheme against coronary infection.
He said that this could be achieved by injecting and using a Nazi vaccine.
For international use, large amounts of immunoglobulin A are formed. This does not occur when the vaccine is administered.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot enter the body.
And within the course of vaccination, we have the most of the immunoglobulins G (antibody).
And if you introduce both vaccines, you get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G, but there's no double vaccination yet," said the doctor.
The main prophylaxisist of UrFO, Dr. Sergey Tokarev, in turn, said that the main advantage of using the Nazi vaccination together with the injection was the possibility to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help to ensure that the protection of the body would probably be maximum.
Former Minister of Health of the Lower Town David Melik-Guesinov said that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic would lead to the spread of a new coronary infection among children.
He said that such a picture was seen in other countries where the regular wave of pandemics had occurred earlier.
Other, um...
I've been talking to a woman like that for a long time, if you're ready to change a warm house, a pet, a pet, a love and a play for a liquid bitch, then go ahead.
But the pessel was trained and quite clever.
He chose my society and went home.
In a video way that works in 90% of cases.
Not so much taken, believe me.
I've been a lot of bosses so they wouldn't run after a dog, even though they thought they'd run away, 200 thousand (pomsky), take a hand and take it to the other side.
In the end, "200 thousand" chose the owner, not the dog that ran somewhere.
In Europe, mass protests against vaccinations are not stopped
In the Austrian capital of Vienna, more than forty thousand demonstrators emerged on the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make copper vaccination compulsory.
From February of the following year, uninvited people will have to pay a fine of €3,600.
The Spanish, driven by health policies, conducted a peace march in Madrid.
Some had a poster in their hands entitled "This is a fake pandemic," "I'm not gonna get vaccinated."
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, the certificate is compulsory for access to bars, restaurants, sports halls, old-fashioned houses and night entertainment facilities.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports in a number of regions of the country has led to an increase in the number of cases of coronation.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand demonstrators protested the strengthening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then it grew into clashes with the guards.
A group of demonstrators began throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officials applied watermelons.
Nikolai S., even in Wikipedia, there is no consensus on this.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also referred to as "the first Russian doctor, doctor," probably because she started studying earlier.
Let's just not argue, I think they both deserve this title.
There is only one thing that agrees with Zechariah: the Americans have only borne the death and plunder of any country wherever it may appear.

WHO has detected “micron” in six decades.
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the new strain of the crown “micron” has already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the proliferation of the new strain may have catastrophic consequences.
The distribution rate of the lot was reported in the WHO report.
As of 9 December, the sample has already been identified in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is because it has been actively spreading since the end of November.
WHO is also concerned at the high rate of the release of the new version of the crown virus.
WHO experts are concerned that the new strain on preliminary data can be passed to the extent of the distribution of the strains of the delta, which is the Indian version of the coronary virus, which is now being led in all countries completely without exception.
Previously, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhan Gebreysus, said that the micronium could have a significant impact on the course of the coronary pandemic.
Similar findings have also been made in Britain.
The experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that “micron” will be released in the next few months.
And the number of patients in Britain alone will be about 1 million, and this is because there are now several hundred people who are officially "micron" in the Kingdom, and estimated to be up to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the “micron” strain, and more than 2,000 people will be taken to the hospital every day.
The British health system will not be able to cope with this.
The situation is complicated by the fact that, according to recent studies, the efficacy of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the strain “micron” 32 times lower than the rest of the disease.
The way he reacts to the "micron" of Russian satellite V is not yet known, it will be understood in the next few weeks.
The Hamalei name centre has only begun testing the Russian vaccine in the strain "micron".

The Russians warned of a new scheme of fraud
Violents have begun to look for new ways to cheat on video messages.
This is what the Reports refer to as experts.
According to the director of Ivideon Zaura Abutalimov's products, the main danger associated with the distribution of video communications is dipheiks.
In this case, a fake video is produced on the basis of real records involving the victim.
This makes it possible to accurately reproduce the behavior of a person.
Abutalimo added that by using dipfaek, the abusers could call the famous video victim or create a role with a copy of the human copy for blackmail.
"Such frauds can simply cause bulling, as a counterfeited offender can put people in awkward, dangerous or compromising pseudoscenaries," said the expert.
In turn, the leading system engineer Varonis Alexander Vetkoll noted that psychological people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks when it comes to video technology.

Five actions are listed to help avoid diabetes
The problem with blood sugar is one of the most common in the world.
Some, however, do not attach great importance to this, nor do they attach great importance to sight.
In time, diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death.
Preventive activities play a key role in preventing disease.
Thus, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime – reducing the number of various drinks and switching to ordinary water positively affects metabolism.
Sweet products increase blood sugar to a dangerous indicator when used in excess.
Therefore, the first step on the road to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keeping them at home.
Not only does it affect the occurrence of the disease but it also affects the habits.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, there is a great need to move.
Experts recommend that low-carbon diets be maintained.
Such management will not only reduce weight but also protect against sharp sugar fluctuations.
Many cells must be eaten to protect against diabetes.
Food fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to the feeling of tightness, the release of food juices, and the uptake of food.

Dr. Paula told us about "migre of the day" in the workers
A number of factors may lead to a worsening of self-esteem in outputs
The reason for the loss of self-esteem after the workplace is often the “migration of the day off”, said a well-known endocrinologist, medical scientist, senior academic officer of the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of IGU, the clinical director of the Zuhra Pavlov System Medical in his telegram channel.
According to her, it is especially common for workers who experience major pain, fatigue, and weakness in their exits.
Dr. Paulova noted that, in addition to the one who was buried during a week of fatigue, there were quite many objective reasons for the negative reaction of the body to change conditions.
Our way of life is changing radically.
"We've been sleeping for a long time, lying on the couch all day, probably eating more, and drinking less," the doctor argued.
For the sake of overeating and for the lack of water, it is a burden and a burden.”
The additional role played by the late rise.
So if you get up three hours later, you get a reaction called a jettlag.
It comes from travellers who cross several time zones.
To determine which factors play a key role in the weakening of self - control, Paul recommended that we keep in mind that the most important thing is to make a difference in the outcome.

Researchers in the UAR reported that the efficacy of Pfizer vaccine against “micron” was low
In the UAR, low efficacy of Pfizer vaccine against “micron” was reported.
The researchers in the South African Republic conducted a study and reported a low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against the micron strain of the coronary infection.
It is estimated that it (the level of micron neutralization) corresponds to (the level of) efficacy of the vaccine in 22.5% against symptomatic infection, which leads... to doubt the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection, says the study published on the MedRxiv portal.
Experts have explained that the medicine can save from a serious flow of the disease.
Earlier in the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, it was predicted that the crown virus strains could cause a new wave of pandemics in Britain with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How many hidden sugars in the usual products?
Sugar is not the best source of useful nutrients.
It may lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Users should take into account that the product may contain hidden sugar, similar to that of calorie, composition and glycaemic index.
Several dozens of names, in fact, of sugar, can be presented on the label.
One of the most common and common names is glucose and fructose.
Other sugars such as dextrose (saccharide obtained from maize), levulose (fruit sugar), melasse (black duck), agawa syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disacharides, and they can be not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, in the medical sausage, bread, etc.
According to Roscachetia, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to use whole and unprocessed products, as well as to pay attention to the label and many different names of sugar.
The various types of sugar are different in taste, but whatever is called the ingredient in the product - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact quantity of sugar, as it is necessary to take into account not only the quantity of sugar indicated by the producer in the package, but also that the plants, fruits, etc. contain a certain quantity of sugar.
Thus, the total quantity of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
Chancellor of Germany Scholz: Gas loses importance for FWG after 25 years
The new FRG Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that gas imports were losing importance for Germany, as the country continued to decarbonize the economy.
According to him, by 2045 Germany was planning to completely abandon gas, oil and coal, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"There will be a world in 25 years' time that the issue of gas transport to the Frag and Europe will play a different role," said the chancellor.
Scholtz noted that Germany continued to maintain its commitment to Ukraine ' s transport of Russian natural gas and in the future, as this resource was currently important for energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States had made a statement supporting the energy transformation of Ukraine by Berlin.
Previously, the head of the German MID Annala Berbok stated that the process of certification of the pipeline " North Stream - 2 " continued.
According to the Minister, in the framework of the coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition treaty, it was stated that energy projects should apply European energy law.
The diplomat also indicated that the pipeline has not yet been "in conformity with the requirements" of the European Union.

In a referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, 12 December, the majority of New Caledonians voted during the referendum against their territory.
The level of participation in the third ballot was much lower than in the two previous ballots.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, “for” the independence of New Caledonia from France, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted, whereas 96.49% (75,762) voted against.”
The figure was 43.90 per cent, with more than 80,000 New Caledonians taking part in the elections.
As France-Presse commented on these interim results, “the outcome of these elections did not leave room for doubt”, as independence supporters urged voters not to vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed it on 12 December, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago prevented a full and fair pre-election campaign.
Thus, this dissatisfaction opened the way for the third victory of French New Caledonia's supporters, following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of the population voted against independence, 53.3% in 2020.
According to separatists, they did not recognize the outcome of the last vote and would argue with the UN.
As stated on Sunday, 12 December, in the Elisei Palace, the President of France Emmanuel Macron must deliver the outcome of the referendum.
The issue of the independence of New Caledonia has rekindled in many of the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates have expressed their favour of keeping the territory of France, since it is the “last region of the European Union’s presence in the Pacific”.
"New Caledonia must remain French," said Eric Zemmur repeatedly.
The same statement was made by a candidate from the Republicans Valeri Pecress, who published a column in Le Figaro at the end of October, urging the Chaldeans to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take the position “because it is not his responsibility”.
However, the President added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed “a strong desire for the selection of the Chaldeans to be the choice of France”.

WSJ readers criticised the article on relations between Russia and the United States
The Wall Street Journal criticised Professor Christopher Hartwell’s article, in which he described his vision of Russia and the United States.
The author expressed concern that the West was allegedly bringing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinced readers of the danger that comes from Moscow and allowed a number of insults to be addressed by Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end of the day, Hartwell called the Western countries “to stand up against Russia” in a single front.
The WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"In this article quite a lot of false information," RIA News comments one of the readers.
"Europe is not ours to "lose it", and Ukraine is not our land.
The United States of America and NATO allies will never enter the nuclear war with Russia for Ukraine," another said.

Magnitude earthquake 5.2 occurred in the Curil Islands area
An earthquake of 5.2 magnitude occurred near Shikotan Island.
It is noted that the earthquake epicenter was 231.8 km north-east of the city of North Kurilsk.
The eyelid lay at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists recorded an earthquake of 7.5 magnitudes in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing reactive pilots of a new generation
At the new Ukrainian-Turkey plant, an ANKA type of reactive unmanned aircraft (BPLA) will be created.
On 11 December, the Foreign Adviser to the Office of the Ukrainian President, Alexei Arestovic, reported this.
That is, they are able to act against air objects, against other unmanned pilots.
Even against a pilot's flight.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the other Turkish aircraft: the corpus and so on," he quoted his Dialogue.ua.
Commenting on the main characteristics of ANKA devices, Arestovic said that they were reactive and not flammable BPLAs.
According to him, it's a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, who surpass it by all its characteristics.
The first batch of BPLA should be manufactured by the factory at the end of next year, Arestovic concluded.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The unmanned pilot was developed by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
The Ukrainian General Headquarters had previously classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile complexes during the military operations of the United Nations in Donbass.
On 6 December, the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Zelenski, reported that the country had begun the construction of a factory for the manufacture of modern military unmanned pilots.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On 29 September, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Minor Defense concluded an agreement to build a centre in the Kiev area where staff training and testing and maintenance of Turkish BPLA Bayraktar will be conducted.
The Office of the Ukrainian Leader's Press Service referred to this memorandum as "a major real step forward".
Two lions escaped at the airport from the container
The lions escaped at the Singapore airport of Changi.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators were able to get out of the container with a lion family arriving on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were sent.
One of the lions runs down the top of the container.
The animals could not be taken from him because of a set of protective nets.
The opposition ended after the arrival at the airport of the Mandai Wildlife Group, which has all Singapore Zoos.
They have removed lions by means of drones with a tranquilizer and plan to deliver them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion fled from his master and wandered through the streets of the city.
On the same day, the animal voluntarily returned home, and the humans did not suffer.
Experts warned of the threat of cancer from vitamin B9
Studies show that vitamin B9 residues, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people with no folic acid deficiency are less at risk of some types of cancer, particularly colorectal.
However, overdosage of the required dose contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor of Alabama University in Birmingham, Dietologist Beth Kitchin recommends monitoring the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer is increased only if it is significantly shifted from this figure to the greater or lesser.
Kitchin recommends not to take vitamin B9 in tablets without the advice of a doctor, to monitor the dose and to avoid milk and other foods containing folic acid.
Previously, the diet consultant Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is included in avocados, Fein recommended that men have more fruit after 50 years.
In the United Kingdom, about 75,000 people can die by April because of micron.
British scientists' forecasts show that because of the spread of the coronary micronium in England over the next five months, up to 75,000 people can die unless the restrictive winter measures are tightened.
This was reported by The Guardian with reference to a study by experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), transmitted by TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of experts who are part of the Scientific and Advisory Panel on Emergency Situations at the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022, at least 25,000 fatalities will be recorded in the country due to the strain of micron and approximately 175 thousand patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the disease, the hospital will receive more than 2,000 infected every day.
“Serious measures to combat the coroner may be necessary to prevent overload of the National Health Service if the microns are more contagious than the delta option and the existing vaccines cannot eliminate the infections”, said the mathematician Rosann Bernard from LSHTM.
Earlier, the UK Health Safety Agency had informed: if the rate of micronucleus is maintained at the current level, about 1 million cases of infection will be detected in the country by the end of the year.
By mid-December, micron strains may become dominant in the United Kingdom.
Currently, in Britain, 1898 cases of coronation micronucleus have been reported, of which 633 have been reported in the last days.
On 9 December, the head of the British Minority, Sajid Javid, pointed out that this figure could actually reach 10,000 cases.
She wanted to write some smart commentary, but she read this place before:

Crustrates for Superhero Increased World for Fourth World · Global Voices
The construction of supers this year, and the next year's orders, all the records are in the world, despite the calls to reduce the carbon footprint and combat climate change.
In the world register of vessels, the number of yachts ordered was 1,200 units, a quarter more than last year.
In the era of combating the effects of climate change on greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have a desire and money for a floating strength of $50 million and above will not be reduced, says The Guardian.
However, they are becoming more and more.
This year 25 per cent of the courts were ordered more than in the previous year.
Brokers say that this was not 20 years old at the market.
The first reason is that many who can afford to fly are afraid of land infections and prefer to hide from the pandemic on their own ship.
The second cause is also related to the coronation virus.
If all these people had previously gone to the office and had met business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them were working remotely and the negotiations were going on.
Broker Will Kristy told the press that the cops were taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that customers are willing to pay more, only if their yachts were ready for at least one year or two earlier.
"People just want freedom, and the superrich could afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize such behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, the sociologists say, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation of space travel, the lives of yachts or airplanes on their own aircraft cause irritation in society, because the elite does not want to share the responsibility for climate change with all other humanity.
Economists call on Governments to act and propose new taxes and rules for super-rich people, although they understand that if money is available, it will be extremely difficult to implement.
In the meantime, it only impresses the number of super yachts ordered, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1200 vessels, 27 are over 100 metres long.
The Norwegian billionaire Rekka is building a REV Ocean jet 183 metres long.
After landing, it'll be the world's largest yacht.
The yacht includes a " moon pool", as well as a submarine designed to explore sea depths.
In existing super yachts, helicopters, open-air cinemas, and some of them, such as MacGregor, have become a platform for singles.The American University Economic Anthropology Professor Richard Wilk says that compared to the total number of greenhouse gases, carbon footprints produced by super-rich people are insignificant.
But it's symbolic if you realize that the multibillionaires in the world hear more than 2,000 people.
This is just another example of the overuse of a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission of billions in a thousand times as much as the average population of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tonnes of CO2 per year, the largest polluter of the planet Roman Abramovic is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases falling into the atmosphere in 2018.
Two thirds of the emission trail was caught on his Eclipse yacht 162.5 metres long.
Even if the owner is not on board, the team continues to poison the planet.
The master can call the captain and give the command to push the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean.
Superheroes do not express the sympathy of others when they, as the richest woman in Australia, Gina Rainhard, who owns the continent mines, complains through YouTube that their giant ships have no place to start.
It is also difficult to understand her call for a 50-metre shipyard.
Hazardous weekly dose of alcohol leading to cervical cancer
American scientists have identified how alcohol per week increases the risk of developing cancer.
This is what the Daily Express edition says.
Experts have concluded that the use of four and more portions of alcohol per week is linked to an increased risk of developing oncology.
This increases the likelihood of disease development by increasing the amount of alcohol used.
Moreover, moderately drinking men have a higher risk of bladder cancer than women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact cause of such oncology, but note that certain factors are harmful to the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the two-year-old child level
Many, and more precisely, dog lovers are convinced that these creations are very intelligent.
But they don't even know how many quadruple pituitaries are actually developed.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to probably learn how to develop animal intelligence.
Although the dog’s vocabulary is not as extensive as human, the new study proves that the dog can respond to 89 words or phrases in a consistent manner.
The work of scientists was published in the publication Sciencealert.
Dogs can't play chess or make texts that don't make sense of politics, economics and art, but they often get their bosses to smear.
Some people believe that experts show better results in understanding the words of the human language, but statistics for accurate conclusions are not yet sufficient.
Thus, some breeds are traditionally considered to be dog geniuses, such as mazes.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are able to think logically and that they do not give up on a two-year-old.

Prepared for trade in the United States and Russia in Ukraine
The United States of America and Russia will be “trading” with regard to Ukraine’s entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in his article for Glaverg.
In his view, Washington and Moscow are about to continue negotiations on the United States guarantees that Ukraine will not enter the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Baiden on the right to “enter anywhere”.
If you are offered something that is obviously unacceptable, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not become a merchant, but just send the offerer.
And for Ukraine, there is a trade," wrote an analyst.
Kochetkov added that Russia was not planning to attack Ukraine but was seeking dialogue with Kiev.
“Preparation shall be carried out in secret, quickly and immediately, and shall not wait until the group has been identified and deployed,” he said.
China encourages the development of the rail transport sector
Traditional Chinese technologies drew the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the China International Rail Transport and Equipment Exhibition in 2021, which was held in the city of Jujuju Province of Hunan /Central China.
The main technologies developed by CRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. have automatically enabled trains to detect and diagnose technical deficiencies, said the representative of Hou Zhaoven.
High-speed trains running the China Laos railway, which had been put into service earlier this month, have already been equipped with these technologies, which will ensure improved reliability and mobility.
In the last six months, China has significantly increased the export of rail vehicles, and many countries of Asia and Europe have witnessed “China’s speed”.
In May of this year, the first two-stage electric trains designed for export to Europe were developed in China with the production line of CRR Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd.
With a maximum working speed of 200 kilometres per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the pilot operation of the metro train, developed by the company for Turkey, began.
The train will be driven by a metropolis connecting Istanbul to the city ' s airport.
The metro line will open next year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey at 120 kilometres per hour.
“China’s railway equipment manufacturing industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness”, said Fhen Yaosen, Head of the Department of Trade and Investment of the China Committee for the Promotion of International Trade (CCCMT).
"This industry is the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high-class equipment on the world market," said Fen Yaosen.
After more than 60 years of hard work, with a number of independent research and development, China has established a better system for the production of railway equipment, with a complete support kit and large-scale production activities.
According to Fen Yaosen, the country is taking the lead in the electrification of railways and in the operation of high-speed and urban railways.
The biologist listed early signs of dementia
The candidate for biological science Semen Golosheikin, in a conversation with Radio Sputnik, listed early signs of dementia.
He said that the signs of future dementia could be oblivion, as well as a number of moderate cognitive violations, such as inability to concentrate, planning, reduction of abstract thinking.
A discussion is under way that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor for its occurrence, the specialist said.
Golosheykin stressed that the causes of dementia could be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer’s disease and the atherosclerosis of the brain vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that doctors today do not know how to treat dementia effectively.
It is therefore necessary to start its prevention in time.
He said that reducing the risk of developing dementia would help to study foreign languages and active communication.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical load, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intense involvement of memory and thinking logic.
“There are recommendations for the application of various BADs, but their effectiveness and usefulness are still discussed in the scientific community,” Golosheikin said.
“The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical load, regular training of cognitive skills and skills through games and hobbies that require intense involvement of memory and thinking logic,” Goloshejkin said.
An earlier charity on dementia research in Britain stated that the disease was increasingly affecting people over the age of 40.
The doctors called early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.
The first alarming sign can be seen as seeing problems that make it difficult for a patient to identify objects.
Another sign of developing weakness has been called pheasant -- a state where one cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
The neurologist needed Saakashvili to be treated abroad
Former Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili needs psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation abroad, said journalist Otar Toidze, who is a doctor's council established under the Georgia Ombudsman.
His [Saakashvili] neurological status is the leading cause of his illness.
There are problems with movement, coordination, nature change," said the specialist, noting that this is not outside the normative framework and now the former president needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
"That's what we call neurorehabilitation and psycho-insurance that we haven't found in Georgia," said Toid, requiring Saakashvili to be treated in a special facility that is not in Georgia.
On the evening of 7 December, Saakashvili began to sabotage medical assistance after his sentence had been imposed by prison officials.
Georgian policy quickly succeeded in abolishing the punishment and restoring itself to the former rights.

Protests against COVID passports in Spain
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protests against a compulsory certificate of vaccination from COVID-19 were carried out by the Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of shareholders was approximately 3,000.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, sports halls, homes of elderly and night entertainment institutions.
Many protestors have come to action without masks.
They accused the State of totalitarianism with their slogans and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
Vaccination passports will also be required in Valencia to enter entertainment facilities and to restore capacity to more than 50 people.
Protesters in the city reported medical dictatorship and called vaccination an experiment.
More than 5.2 million cases of coronary infection have been reported in Spain since the beginning of the pandemic, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
Russia is also planning to impose restrictions on unvaccinated people.

Hard Rise: How the Chinese Become Goats
The Olympics should attract millions of people and help create international resorts in the country
In China, it is hoped that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports activities, which will enable President C. Zinpin to collect 1 trillion yuan, but also facilitate the economic development of remote provinces.
The top-level Taiwan resort in Zhangzjakou, located near the winter Olympics, is becoming more and more popular with the Chinese.
In addition to infrastructure construction in the region, greening work is carried out: workers are cutting trees.
There are more than 700 mountain resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to accept international competition.
In many regions of China, where there are resorts, including in Zhangjakou, there are snow problems.
The main long-term objective is to provide comfortable and interesting rest in Chinese resorts so that all new ones can become permanent.
However, it is still far from that.
Gambling Adviser Justin Downs says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed to ignorance.
Every year, more and more Chinese are being sent to the shelters.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, one of them.
Despite serious changes, it will take many years to create a mining culture here, says Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to develop and build the infrastructure needed for rest.
The 70-year-old Gao Macong lives in Khugli, near the Winter Olympic Games.
He noted that there had been a wave of winter sports tourism in recent years.
Two years ago, a speedy railway from Beijing to Khugli was running, and now no local resident suffers from unemployment.
More and more stores are being opened in the country with clothing and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes are opened the survey points with the dishes of the national kitchen.
There's even a COVID-19 test station in Taiwan now.
China is seeking to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes must be leaders of major international competitions, and the resorts and equipment must reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world may face extreme poverty because of the pandemic, WHO said.
More than 500 million people in the world can be put into extreme poverty because of the crown virus pandemic, which has slowed mankind ' s progress in universal access to health services, declared in the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
Two complementary reports were published in connection with the International Day for the Universal Scope of Health Services of WHO and WB on 12 December.
They found that the pandemic had caused meds to fail, causing excessive tension in health care systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, the coverage of immunization decreased, increased mortality from tuberculosis and malaria.
WHO and WB stressed that the pandemic has caused “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, which has made it more difficult for people to pay for treatment”.
The situation is pushing more than 500 million people “to extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services from their pocket”.
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterris said that the crown virus pandemic had put over 100 million people into poverty, and more than four billion people had virtually no social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese Minister turned off the "Samoite for Democracy" broadcast at the request of the White House
Taiwanese Digital Technology Minister Audrey Tan's speech at the panel discussion during the U.S. organized "Samita for Democracy" was translated into video-free mode, a record of the summit on YouTube.
The Reuters Agency, with reference to sources, claims that the picture was unlocked at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was the map on which Taiwan was assigned a separate colour from the PRC, which considered the island to be its territory.
The map shown by Ms. Tan was drawn up by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world on the level of civil rights.
Taiwan was designated green as "free", while the PRC, the PRC, Laos and Viet Nam were red as "closed".
After the Minister showed the map, the picture was replaced by a screenshot, noting that the views of the participants in the discussion “did not necessarily express the position of the United States Government”.
The DRC was not invited to the "Sammit for Democracy".
The sources of Reuters note that the map demonstrated by the Taiwanese minister could have gone against China's one-way policy, which is held by Washington.
One agency source stated that, following the demonstration of the map, the United States National Security Council was angry with the Department of Hosts, accusing him of showing Taiwan to a particular country.
The “Samith for Democracy” organized by Washington went from 9 to 10 December with representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate's "zero-day" summit, the editor-in-chief of the "New Newspaper" Dmitry Muratov called for an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be given to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary Sobez RF Yury Averyanov stated that the summit carried an “anti-Russian and anti-Third Charge”.

The spaceship New Shepard with six tourists on board has made a sub-bital flight
The spaceship New Shepard of Blue Origin with six tourists on board took off on Saturday, December 11, a sub-bital flight.
The travel on the company’s website lasted a total of more than ten minutes, after which the passenger capsule landed on the ground, TASS reported.
The launch of the carrier rocket was carried out with a cosmodroma in the area of the American city of Van Horn, Texas.
The ship rose to a height of more than 100 km, and space tourists were in a state of unrest.
The rocket-carrier itself has landed on the space of the cosmodrome.
Blue Origin has successfully completed the first sub-bital flight of New Shepard with passengers on board on 20 July.

And if that's off, then what right do you have to condemn them?
I guess it's just in education like this...
The elected parents themselves dictate their rules by explicitly influencing the existing ones.
What if this is true of other areas of life, judicial proceedings, etc.?
The laws are not written for them.
What if the Pope still implements his education and education method?
They're living something and an example for others very bad.

China is strengthening the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where landfills are located
A joint mechanism for the prevention and control of the State Council of the PRC has been issued by a circular to strengthen the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where landfills are located in order to further prevent the spread of infection from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving these cities should provide a negative test for COVID-19 nucleic acids received 48 hours before departure.
Those arriving in the city where landfills are located shall, upon arrival, submit at least one test for COVID-19 nucleic acid.
The document states that these requirements will take effect from the day the relevant provincial-level administrative units determine and publish the area of these cities until 15 March 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities with landfill sites that meet certain conditions may consider the possibility of establishing buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

In MIDI, “suffering” was reported in relations between Russia and the United States
The Russian M.I.D. in the "Reports" interview assessed the prospects for Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long way of interaction had led to sad conclusions, and problems between the two countries had begun not yesterday.
One side negative predictability is, and that is, in some way, the prospect of better relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion as a result of the long journey that we have been through both with the current administration and with Trump and Obama.
The problems started not yesterday," said the diplomat.
According to Rabkov, the problem is that the United States is seeking to impose on Russia approaches on a number of issues.
The mid-caps added that they would not be at risk of giving optimistic forecasts of improved relations and would not expect to change Washington's position.
He explained that, with the exception of strategic stability and cybersecurity, progress had not been made.
Russia, however, calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security and hopes that the signals will be heard and that Americans will listen to the arguments of a healthy sense.
Former Head of the Russian MID Sergei Lavrov, at a meeting with US Secretary-General Anthony Blinken, said that Moscow was ready to resume dialogue with the United States.
The virus expert warned of the danger of vaccination with a national medicinal product from COVID outside hospitals
A national vaccine from COVID-19 may cause allergies and may require medical attention, so the first points for this product should not be organized at airports and shopping centres.
This was reported by TASS virusologist, RAN member, bioananotechnology, microbiology and virusology at the University of Novosibir State, Sergei Netesov.
It was easier to organize the vaccination of the Nazi vaccine at airports and shopping centres, but I would only do so at the first time in medical institutions.
The fact that an allergic reaction to such a vaccine is likely to occur is small but desirable for a person to sit next to the doctor’s office.
The doctor has special sets of anti-allergic drugs that work literally within a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," Netesov said.
In the opinion of the virologist, it would be possible to consider vaccination at commercial centres when experience in the use of the product is gained.
He also stressed that when using the Nazi vaccine, it was important for her to fall onto a mucous membrane in her nose.
However, there is a likelihood that the vaccine will not reach its destination if it is drained after injection.

In Britain, 1239 cases of crown virus micron - RT were reported in Russian for days
During the day in Britain, 1239 cases have been reported with a new crown virus strain.
That's what Sky News reports.
In particular, 1196 new cases of the strain “micron” were recorded in England, 38 people were infected with a new variety of infections in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of patients with COVID-19 from the new strain in the United Kingdom reached 3137.
Previously scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in Pessimistic Prognosis estimated that about 75,000 people could die in England by April because of the outbreak of the crown virus caused by the strain “micron”.
Sand has warned of the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russia sanctions
President Dmitry Peskov's press secretary commented on the possibility of imposing anti-Russia sanctions in the event of continued “aggressive actions” against Ukraine, including due to the alleged “invasion” of the country.
“There are restrictions against Russia and no suffering itself – it is impossible," said the official representative of Kremlin in the Russian television channel.
Sand claims it's "understanding everyone in the world."
Earlier it was reported that the United States considered the possibility of imposing anti-Russia sanctions on energy as a final measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union are planning to introduce restrictions that will complicate the conversion of rubles into dollars for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, Sberbank's head, German graffiti, is convinced that this is impossible.

The New Caledonians rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the overwhelming majority of the participants refused to leave France.
On 12 December, the French television channel BFM.TV reported this.
There were 96.5% of those who voted against independence.
French independence was supported by 3.51% of the inhabitants of the South Pacific archipelago.
The results were cancelled by 2.99 per cent of the bulletins.
The vote on that day was very low: about 55 per cent of the people of the archipelago had moved to the area.
In the opinion of the experts, the low incidence is due to the calls of separatists to give up their participation in the referendum because of the coroner ' s virus.
Paris refused to transfer the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, the inhabitants of New Caledonia protested against independence from France.
A referendum on independence has already been held in the region in 2018.
The majority of the population supported the finding of an archipelago in France.
New Caledonia is almost 20,000 kilometres from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
Some 270 thousand people live in the archipelago, and the territory is granted special administrative and territorial status.
There is a 1998 agreement between Paris and the New Caledonian Administration that allows the region to vote on its independence twice every two years.

WHO provisionally considers “micron” less dangerous than “delta”
The World Health Organization (WHO) provisionally believes that “micron” is less dangerous than the coronary artery delta.
However, there is evidence of a decrease in vaccine effectiveness in the new version of COVID-19.
As of 9 December, “micron” was registered in 63 countries.
“Precise data and a significantly altered antigenic profile of the strain “micron” vaccine suggest a reduction in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and the transfer of the option.
According to the preliminary findings of the RAC, it is expected that it (the severity of the disease - row.) may be less severe than that of the delta," says the WHO technical report.
The Organization notes that all recorded cases of infection of "micron" in the EU have yet to take place easily or unsymptomatically.
However, the new strain, according to the preliminary data, is distributed more rapidly to the deltas.
In Russia, there are two cases of micron-styrene infection.
They “were previously immunized”, the Hamalei Name Centre reported.
Anna Popova, the head of the Rosary Guard, said that there was no reliable evidence yet that the new version of the coroner was less dangerous than the others.

In Ukraine, four scenarios were cited for the Greens
The former High Council Member, Wadim Denisenko, listed four options for the development of events for Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenski in 2022.
In his view, the head of State could remain without support from the West and possibly compromise on Donbass.
On Sunday, 12 December, Denisenko told us about this in publications on Glaverg.
The first option that Denisenko called the “ideal storm” implies that Ukraine will cease to support key Western countries by reaching agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such developments will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev could face in 2023.
“In parallel, prices for key products are being reduced, which we traditionally export in domestic protests and opposition to key GEFs (financial and industrial groups. - Red.)” added the former parliamentary.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - “war against all”.
This forecast will arise in the event of high turbulence in world policy, where Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
As a result of this provision, Ukraine ' s leadership may compromise on Donbass, which may lead to resistance within the country.
At the end of the summer, the position of the Greens will be weakened, the likelihood of such a situation, according to the former snitch, would be up to 50-55 per cent.
The third option of developing the situation in Ukrainian politics is the opposition of the Green People ' s Group and the President, which is likely to lead to the control of the power bloc and the implementation of “popular initiatives”.
During this crisis, Zelenski will begin "reforming the power", added Denisenko.
Another scenario is the conversion of the Green to the "father of the nation".
This could lead to some event that would be a great shock to society.
"The situation must be large enough to respond to external partners and increase Ukraine's support," Denisenko said.
Such an option is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a technological disaster or an aggressive action by Russia, considered ex-depute.
However, the Russian side has not once rejected any likelihood of an attack on Ukraine.
In Moscow it was noted that Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States were increasing military activity at Russian borders.
Earlier on 11 November, data from the survey of the social group "Rating" showed that the Ukrainian President's rating dropped to a record low, with 19.3 per cent.
This is the lowest indicator since the election of its head of State.
Analysts predicted a situation in which, in the case of the forthcoming elections of the President of Ukraine for the Greens, only 21.8 per cent would vote, whereas in the case of the former President of the country, Peter Poroshenko, 14.5 per cent would vote.
Of all those questioned, only 19.3 per cent expressed support to the President.

Arrested for action in the Red Square, the poet says, "Eutushenko gives 10 days for the quote, that's it, the strength of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Wolchenkov was arrested.
The VSE student was detained in the Red Square with a poster on which was written the hashtag #poetrossympoet.
This quote belongs to the writer Evgen Eutushenko.
A protocol on the administrative article on the re-infringement of the order of public action was drawn up in Alexandria.
For the first time, he was arrested on 23 January in Puschin Square, at a meeting in support of Alexei Navalio.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry as a whole, and now interest in it is, unfortunately, lost to the decline of a common culture in Russia and the equally low hope to inspire unknown poets to write their verses online under this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We contacted a young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and to explain in more detail the message of his message.
How did police officers deal with you in custody this time and before?
What were they asking in the department about commenting on your action?
This time, the staff were more correct, the detention was as good as possible, as if it didn't sound funny in some context.
On Pušinska, the OMONovs were taken and taken hard.
They asked the standard, about the motives.
When they heard it, they saw it in principle, if it wasn't for the approval, it was for the understanding.
Except for all four sides of the bead, everything was absolutely right, but I knew what was going on.
And if, after the action under this hashtag, they start writing their verses, even though a few people, I don't see these 10 days.
The maximum protocol allows you to speak at least in the Tumba-jumba tribe language.
Public and official activities speak the language of the environment so that everyone can understand what happened in the Bundestag on 25 September 2001 or in the native language through the translator.
This protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks beautifully in Russian, but still resorts to the help of the translator.
There is still a stenogram on the old handkerchief on official activities, and the stenographer is not required to know several languages.

Researchers have described how potatoes help to combat age-related disorders
The study has shown that potatoes are rich in vitamins and micronutrients that contribute to improved blood circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
The root fruit contains vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, fish flavin, folate and pantotenonic acids.
All of these elements assist in the functioning of the system of the body.
In addition, potatoes help to combat age-related violations.
Because of its large cell content, it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract and can also help prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis when used regularly.
However, for the best of the fruit, it is better to chew or boil rather than to burn on the olive.
Previously, The Daily Express warned that potatoes could be dangerous for diabetes, as well as other high-glycaemic products.
These are products containing carbohydrates that are quickly spread over sugar, such as sugar, sweet non-alcoholic beverages, white rice, and white bread.
At the beginning of December, the Commercials warned of the potential shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting the decrease in its production in private sub-holdings and the increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, only imports will be able to replace the product deficit at the moment.

Only qualitative and premium fillingers have been included in the product, which have recommended themselves exclusively for the best.
Springs: A block of independent spring “micropackets” is set in the centre of the model.
This means that there are 2,000 spirals in the bedroom that work fully autonomously.
It is their operation that gives a unique point setting.
Micropacket is the most common of all the variety of Dimaxa spring blocks, so it has a highly pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillers: the upper and lower of the spring is a combination of corrugated and natural latex layers.
The only difference is the order of the plate.

If the jaw provides proper back support, the latex will adapt the surface below the human body.

Estonian scientists will look for life in Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, prepares three space missions to Venus for the search for life's signs in the atmosphere, reported the “Current Chamber” on Sunday.
The goal of the five-year missions is to assess the suitability for the Venus clouds and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists have proposed tools to measure acidity and oxygen content in the Venus clouds.
So far, the Venus cloud, the nearest planet Earth, was supposed to be too acidic to exist there, but probably Venus was originally a planet of the earth type.
During the third mission, a sample of Venus should be provided.
Let's assume that if we find life there, it's going to be the main question, whether it looks like the earth or whether it's different.
If so, it would be obvious that life on earth did not begin.
If it is different, it may be more likely that life was born on Earth," said the Estonian team leader of the Venus Life Finder project, Michael Pausalu.

Targets will change the Russian business
The theme of the meta-hospitals became a popular fall this year when Mark Zuckerberg announced Facebook becoming Meta.
For the market, this event has become an important signal: the biggest game has confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
In other words, the business in Russia, as it is around the world, will invest in the creation of its own metabolisers and their subsequent coinization.
Targets should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the tendency to create remote interactions in the pandemic is that people have become disillusioned and restricted.
It is also the result of a business ' s desire to develop ecosystems and adapt operating models under them.
Third, they are a logical continuation of the asset digitization trend when any rights, securities, art and even money are converted into digital format.

The British economist was unable to predict 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to predict 2022 as he believed such attempts would be a failure.
He wrote in the article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be an unpredictable trap and any trend can change traffic.
The crown virus pandemic remains the most important factor, and secondly, inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he did not know whether or not the price increase was temporary.
As the expert pointed out, before the pandemic, it was clear that “the world of infinite generosity of central banks had already survived” and that it was time to return to relations where inflation rates would correspond to the expected growth of GDP.
O'Neill noted that the continuation of excessive economic policies in the background of the pandemic could, in the opinion of some experts, lead to a new outbreak of inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to productivity growth, as well as to the increase in poverty and climate change, O'Neill summarized.
Earlier, Michael Schulgin, head of the Global Research Open-up Division, reported that the positive expectations for the 2022 dollar would remain, while the potential for growth would be less significant.
Among the risks to the dollar, Schulgin called the FRS monetary policy, the dynamics of oil prices and fears in the background of the Crown Virus pandemic.
It's a matter of agreeing.

Russians gave around 4.5 per cent of the country's GDP to autodiversaries
As a result of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, 28 per cent more than in the same period last year, the Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI) statistics show.
To understand the scale, about the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the State in support of citizens and economies during the coronary plague.
President Vladimir Putin said last September, at the meeting of the heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, that this amount was more than 4.5 per cent of the country ' s gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
According to the revenues on the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia is leading.
In 10 months this year, he was able to make a total of 325.7 billion rubles, almost 24 per cent more than a year earlier.
The Hyundai family Kia has an even higher growth rate of over 35 per cent, and the car sales yield is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
At the leading positions of this brand and to increase the average car price - Hyundai has grown by almost 21 per cent per year, up to 1.94 million rubles - the strongest travel dynamics was only in Changang, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
However, the sales of Korean brands did not increase so much: according to the statistics of the Autoproducers Committee of the European Business Association in Russia, Kia, in terms of quantity, had achieved 9.4% more than a year earlier in the same period.
Hyundai is almost 12%.
Closes a three-year-old Japanese Toyota's cash sales leader, who spent 275.5 billion rubles on the Russian brand's cars, which was 14 per cent more than a year earlier.
The Japanese follow Mercedes-Benz with 266.1 billion rubles (+75 per cent) in the German brand for sale and sales (37%) and the weighted average car price (almost 28 per cent, up to 8.2 million rubles).
"Mecedes-Benz has a good sales growth and a medium-weighted price -- more, for example, than BMW -- from here and a greater increase in financial assets -- explained the Director General of NAPI Tatian Arabadji.
At the rate of sales growth, fantastic indicators show Chinese brands, which have also increased significantly this year's financial wealth."
The Russian Income Growth Lada shows average income (plus 28 per cent), spending 229.4 billion rubles on Russian cars in 10 months.
Last year there were companies whose car sales dropped in 2021: in particular Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
WAZ and, in fact, in 10 months Russians spent 12 billion rubles on off-roads and pickups of this brand against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
In the light of the problems of delivery of components and production failures covering the world's highways, cars continue to adjust prices continuously, the same AutoWAZ increased the value of Lada's models seven times a year, and the last trip (of 8 to 10 thousand rubles) took place at the end of November.
The prices for their products and other self-producers are regularly rewritten.
The volume of the Russian car market in monetary terms will continue to increase, in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation is contributing to this, as well as the desire of car companies to win the past losses, experts believe.
In the absence of cars, I think that many car companies have even partially been able to transfer the cost of the past periods to the user, which they could not have put in the price of cars before,
"VTB Capital" analytics by Vladimir Bespalov's car.
I believe that, financially, self-producers are feeling very good now, supporting a high margin of sales."
This is a direct indicator of the rate of increase in the cost of cars observed during 2021, and the prices for new cars are increasing faster, the expert points out.
In the long term, the market will grow both in terms of quantity and in terms of money, but mainly through inflation and the complexity of the machinery itself, Bespalov predicts.
With increasing opportunities for price increases, there will be limited scope.
In monetary terms, the Russian author will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the cost of cars is slowed down, car manufacturers will be able to obtain their income from volume, notes the independent car consultant Sergei Burgazlev.
In view of the increased demand and insufficient supply, car manufacturers are now seeking the highest profit from each car sold, notes Burgazlie.
The increase in the production of cars is not expected at least in the next half-years, while in Russia, there is still an increase in the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
On the background of the market situation, cars have proved to be a bad place for investment - a car purchased a year ago, even in the process of selling the original value now, says the expert.
Byiden spoke of the transfer of the U.S. military to Ukraine in the event of an invasion of Russia
The U.S. leadership has never considered sending U.S. soldiers to Ukraine in the event of an invasion of Russia.
Such a statement was made by the President of the United States, Joe Byden.
"There was never such a plan," said the White House head, answering the journalist's question whether the United States had given up such an idea.
Byiden noted that, in the event of a escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia would face economic consequences.
He stressed that the United States and NATO had no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of escalation.
The American leader also stated that there was no possibility of unilateral use of American troops to defend Ukraine on the agenda.
Byiden explained that if Russia invaded the territory of Ukraine, the United States would transfer force to NATO (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We will have to send more American and NATO troops to the east flank, B9 - all NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia," Baiden said.
Former Russian President Dmitry Peskov's press secretary stressed that Moscow had no intention of invading the territory of Ukraine.
He pointed out that Moscow saw the problem of the military use of the drones imposed by Kiev by Turkey, as well as that “American weapons are approaching our territory”.
