A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policies with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth by confirming that the number of people killed by lightning in the United States is rarer than the number of people killed by lightning.
In the United States, only 300 cases of electoral fraud have been reported by the Republican lawyers in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for the conduct of the elections in each country.
In this sense, the majority of US governments have been publishing new laws since 2009 which make it difficult to register or enter the urn.
After the November 2010 elections, 675 new Republican representatives could be listed in 26 countries.
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced in 2011 alone, which restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a light picture and evidence of US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce the time limits for the provisional vote, render invalid the right to register as a voter on the day of election, and give citizens the right to vote for which there is a legal act.
Before the 2006 elections, no US state has asked voters to present a light picture card.
Indiana was the first state to raise such a claim.
In 2008, the United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Indian law.
The Republican authorities hesitated to extend this practice to other countries.
In the last two years, they have encouraged in 34 federal states draft legislation requiring voters to present a light picture card.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible persons, do not have a photo of light issued by a government authority of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a record.
However, more than a hundred dollars are often paid to obtain the necessary evidence.
Of the new restrictions, young people, minorities and low-income people are disproportionately affected.
In fact 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with income less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years old and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years old do not have the required light display.
This is still enough.
Students who are regarded as voters who vote more and more for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photovoltaic card issued by their institution in several countries.
On the other hand, the same States allow members of fishing or hunting associations who choose more strongly for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
Prior to 2004, no state has requested evidence of citizenship for the election.
Arizona was the first state to make such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws that require voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures clearly aim to limit Hispanic votes.
Because it is up to two out of three Spanish voters to prefer the democratic party.
In addition, Republican legislators in 2011 have promoted laws in eight federal states that abolished the registration of voters on election day.
In addition, you have restricted the right of individuals and groups to assist those voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, campaigns for electoral registration in the 2004 general elections have contributed to the registration of approximately 10 million citizens.
Because the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the proportion of registration of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators have passed laws in five other federal states aimed at shortening the time limit for the provisional vote.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33% of the voters who elected in advance were African Americans, although they constituted only 13% of the voters of the state.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the people who had chosen in advance.
In contrast, the Whites, which represented 76% of the voters, accounted for only 46% of the voters who elected in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have vigorously opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several draft laws were blocked by the vetos of the democratic governor.
The U.S. Attorney-General has intervened to put forward the most controversial laws.
They could partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 federal states have passed laws requiring a light display.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote.
The democratic critics advocate the party political nature of the laws adopted and see in them as a clear objective the impact of the results in the countries that are affected for 2012.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that those States that have passed these laws constitute 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral body to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these amendments to the electoral legislation will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Early detection of prostate cancer: should the test be performed or not?
In fact, the PSA test shows sometimes incorrect results, with false negative or even false positive results leading to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to a stronger delay of the previously undecided men for carrying out early recognition tests.
Whether the test should be performed or not
We have sought the opinion of two experts.
In the US studies, there were numerous interference factors between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and to make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study also showed that in a 12-year follow-up study, the probability of metastases formation is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been performed.
That is why I recommend the test from 50 or 40 years of age if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent also have a higher risk.
The most important is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
Patients must be made to understand the extent of their risk of cancer by showing them the possible options in which prostate cancer can remain untreated if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases it is more likely to be active in monitoring the disease.
Today, there is no treatment for many men who have been diagnosed with cancer because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are offered active surveillance and are offered treatment when the disease progresses.
The criteria for a decision which should be dealt with and who should not be dealt with are increasingly precise.
That is why I recommend that the test be carried out.
But most importantly, it is to talk to his doctor to determine whether he should be performed or not.
In cooperation with the international company for urology, Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.
This document (currently only in English, but will soon be available) can be downloaded from http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening
Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of getting sick.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone ate well and moved sufficiently.
"If there were no smokers, this value would increase to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancer is caused by inheritance.
Several also remain completely unclear.
For Canadian cancer society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It damages the health of people.
"Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," says André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting the cigarette, the risk of dying of cancer decreases by half.
The weight
According to Canadian cancer society, overweight and adipositas also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast, colon, bowel, feeding ears, bowel and cervical cancer.
"The research shows that regular physical activity protects against colon cancer throughout life," he adds.
The diet
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too much, it increases the risk of developing a lump or stomach cancer.
Roots should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smokers, dry or salt may lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body cells and lead to cancer development," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have examined the relationship between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their investigations are currently not final.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not yet been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family pre-load.
"The conduct of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs Boson Analyses
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs Boson made a certain observation last summer, and this for good reason.
It is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism that is responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, this is the last particle, whose existence from the standard model - our best or "minimum false" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - was predicted, but empirically not yet observed.
But for the physicists it is still not quite certain that it is really about the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a large physical congress in Kyoto, but there is still no data to be completely secure about it.
Nevertheless, let's assume that it's actually about the Higgs, because there seems to be only a small risk of being deceived, and we're looking at what's going on.
In this world, there is a legally binding law that makes it impossible for two objects to be present at the same place.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and do not try too hard to hurt yourself.
Because even if particle physics is a really rare world, it turns out that a similar law applies to it as well: the Pauli exclusion principle, which means that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same "quantity state", while this "state" consists largely of some of its properties.
From that point on, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In a corner are the good citizens who are called fermione and are politely obedient to the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the bosons move, a bad band of anarchists, whose nothing is holy - at least not this principle, which means that they can actually be at the same place at the same time.
These bosons are divided into two groups, according to The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboren, which is absolutely amazing: the Mesones, which we will not treat here and the "particles of power", by which the great forces of nature spread and which the Higgs boson would somehow relate.
However, it must be stressed here that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as you might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of exceptional banality: the photon or the "light particles", which is the "boat" of the electromagnetic force.
That is, if a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field is precisely "distorted" in this place, in an example of a pebble that was thrown into a pond.
This "distortion" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and therefore one of the bosons "bears the force".
Stable Field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, except that another field, the Higgs field, needs to be "distorted" so that this boson can be shown.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the trigger must reach very high energies, a little similar to a frozen pond, whose surface could only be frightened by a very large rock.
This is why a huge particle accelerator like the CERN is needed - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a size of 27 km! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never keep it from itself in the refrigerator.
And likewise, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the others (as well as the photo) do not have mass.
For what can all these research be "good" now, does Mrs. Plamondon ask?
For science, they are used to check the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicists to carefully examine all the differences between the observations and predictions of the SM.
There are many physicists who seem to hope that such variations will be found, since the smallest difference opens a door to a "new physics" and could stop some holes in the model.
It must be said that the latter is still a major flaw, as there is no explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter that makes up about 80% of the matter of the universe (ups! again).
However, no such deviations have been found in the CERN so far.
Effects
The impact of these research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no such thing.
By the way, in the early 1960s, the laser pioneers in Bell laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the deceased physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who himself developed the first permanent striker (the first to be pulsed) in 1962 - has already said that the laser was seen at the beginning rather than a "laborplayery".
Imagine...
In addition, applications may also arise from all the instruments surrounding research.
For example, in 1969 Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, today this sensor serves all digital cameras around the world as "eyes" and introduced the Nobel Prize for Physics to him in 2009.
Of course this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it means that you can never really know it...
Palliative care - the best way to die...
With her committee for "Die in Urde", Quebec recently discussed the tricky question of the end of life.
The debate must be resumed in a short time, although a draft legislation is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devor has tried to look this up.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Monterégie.
The prostate cancer that killed him had left him a two-year period.
"They gave me five years to live, I made seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed in his home for Palliative Care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he had arrived in the morning.
"However, it's always a shock, and you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease makes her work: an immeasurable weakness prevents her from going to the toilet alone and even eating herself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he wishes to resign to help with the meal.
It is even brave to smile at him and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medications, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that you heal my breakthrough, because this is embarrassing," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man is stuck in a stand," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the home of Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for some.
"This depends on the person's ability," he says.
Because according to a number of people who work in the palliative care, large events take place in the middle of these steps.
Patients enrolled in the home for Palliative Care Victor-Gadbois suffer from cancer.
You have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer overwhelmed by the doctors and nurses who care for them with so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by stuttering".
But because of the illness, I really got to know my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I don't have any more desires in my life," she says before she accepts a mask that helps her breathe.
She still expects a last visit from her son from Italy in the coming days.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, you can offer a group of voluntary body care and assistance in food intake.
Palliative care is then used if there are no other options.
To make death more pleasant.
A bed for palliative care is available to 11.700 inhabitants in Quebec.
That's very little if you take into account that one day we're all going to die.
Here life is continued under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
Depending on your wishes, you'll give the deceased a mouth care with Brandy or Pepsi.
Diabetics must no longer control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of the day.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died in the course of the night.
This morning his son will pour out the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We also help relatives and patients alike," says Nathalie Savard.
In Victor-Gadbois' home is not a day like the other.
In addition to an elderly 93-year-old man who enjoys the last family meeting in the court and is well supported by his pillows while being attacked to his honor, a 36-year-old man dies, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two little children, tragically after he has tried everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been covered with cancer patients less than 45 years of age," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients enrolled in the home of Victor Gadbois come from their place of residence, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care to alleviate the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the final stage of their life, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Home Victor-Gadbois and the Society for Domestic Palliative Care in the Greater Montreal Room, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
That is exactly the great inadequacies in Quebec's health care ensures that several doctors specialized in palliative care are not concerned about the adoption of a death aid law and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been on the move, signed by prominent figures of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not effective enough to ensure that all the right to quality palliative care before accepting death benefit is passed.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who had been in the emergency for 14 days without taking action to relieve her.
I fear that patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists are treating their patients in spite of the worst forecasts to the last day.
The chances of Hélène Richard's survival were already minimal when she discontinued a serious chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop the treatment, she told me that she regretted that I was giving up the fight, she told me.
However, she had told me that I was at the end!
No All-Powerful Care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have prayed to die thank the nursing staff for not having given this wish after being relieved of their pain by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be made clear that palliative care is not omnipotent in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, the head of the Palliative Care Society of the House of Palliative Care of the Greater Montreal Space, 8% of patients are not talking about pain treatment.
Thus, at the very end of life, physicians often revert to terminal sedation, which leads to patients either sporadicly or permanently sleeping until their death.
We can't do that anymore than if we don't see this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly be able to rely on this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not alleviated all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But this doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to sleep with me", but "I want my pain to be relieved".
The implementation of this report was possible because of a journalism grant from Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate canals large extent in Quebec
Officials of the Road Construction Office, companies of the construction industry, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia tell every day what they know about a great "system" in which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade union officers and Mafisos are involved.
A "industry", which was very expensive for the Quebec taxpayer, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is strange how the system collapses, since drastic measures have been taken," jokes Jacques Duchesneau, deputy in Quebec and former head of the Montreal Police.
The scandal was discovered by him on the basis of an in-depth investigation of the riots in connection with the contracts for road construction in Quebec, which the then prime minister had only voted against.
The "noise-new report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and the recruitment of officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he stresses that "the Ministry of Transport alone had saved a billion dollars from the contracts," because some were pulling their instincts to get their share!
The Carbonneau Commission "has already brought about two mayors", he adds, in the hope that they will succeed in "showing the tactics behind the individuals".
A 2011 life-enforced permanent anti-corruption unit
The permanent anti-corruption unit, which was launched in 2011, is also making great efforts with its troops on the government’s economic auditors, experts and analysts.
In addition, the policemen of the "Marteau-Truppe", who have since 2009, made Montreal's "canalization cartel" more restrictive in the artificial awakening of the contracts...
In recent weeks, she has particularly carried out domestic investigations and has raised charges of fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a city.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who had just retired from his office as mayor of Laval, the third largest city of Quebec.
He is suspected of having repeatedly received butter money in exchange for public contracts.
In addition, engineers of the Montreal Road Construction Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurs and Lino Zambito, were explicitly accused.
The latter took the view by explaining to the Commission how the "system" works in order to obtain public contracts.
For several years he paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to an intermediary associated with the Mafia who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gerald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr. Zambito had his hand at stake everywhere, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals who were then in power.
He was also asked to organize an illegal procurement for former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Canalization contracts whose costs have been artificially borne by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
Former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes amounting to $736.000 as a counterfactual for sewer contracts whose costs he artificially incurred.
Other officials of the road construction office have admitted that they suffered from glare by artificially bluffing the calculations with incorrect additional services by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay of deliberately ignoring a shadow budget that filled his boxes with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay withdrew at the beginning of November, which brought Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first deputies, who beat the alarm.
As mayor of the town district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she turned down the sale of a municipal property in 2010 that had been purchased for 5 million dollars and resold for 1.6 million construction companies in the booming real estate market.
70% Black money in the campaign
From the investigation that is finally carried out, it says that it "draws on a thread that enables it to understand the functioning of the system that has been submerged by Amies to stop the evil and push the guilty".
She says the procedure is "painful, but positive".
We are in the process of cleaning the wounds, however, need only a specific investigation unit for Montreal, as well as an oversight to prevent the return of questionable practices.
How to clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes, for his part, that "Officers have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is especially thinking about the role of "mandates who are in the picture about tactics", if they were not involved in fraud!
On the basis of a 70% black money in the financing of the election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "We have been told that this is just a weakness of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to $100, which it believes would not change the situation: "If election expenditure is not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete revision of the public procurement system and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by taking the courage to build up the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages Quebec's international view and that of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau calls on those who laugh about taking a look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season you have adopted a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
You can explain it through personal insight, but also through the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on her side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me daily to improve my level of play.
And in a game, this is even easier.
It's all going very fast in football.
But I don't get excited.
Since my beginnings in the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine until my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made progress.
They therefore take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new accesses this summer are used to issuing very high levels of games.
You also know that each training unit is crucial.
This leads to a player like me who has to offer the steering and wants to give his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my playing position.
He is supported by co- trainers like Claude Makelle, who played on the same position as I.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti pays respect to all technicians.
In League 1 there is currently no comparable person, and it is among the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with respected associations.
He had contact with big players.
I think he'll win another title in Paris.
In January I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At the time, I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust that he has put in me is also an explanation for my performance.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In the league 1 Lyon took the place of the top rider.
But we're in the back.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we have thus qualified for the Eighth Final.
What is the aim of the association in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have our words against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to be the first of our group to be in front of Porto, so that we can replay the eighth final as a home game.
Can the PSG in the short term become a large European association?
He's already got the budget for it...
In order to become a large European association, Paris must acquire title and make a name for itself in the long term.
This is not the case today.
The PSG is financially the means to adopt concrete forms of this project.
Would it be a big mistake not to win the title in League 1 as it was in the last season of the case?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year it is really up to us to give up this title.
In the last season, we were close.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to win.
We have ended the season with a very strong performance.
We've finished with 79 points.
Normally you should be a 79 point master...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even though the great teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are calling for the title, I think we have the evidence to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
In view of what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We accept it perfectly.
However, if we win a home game against Troyes 4-0 and you still find something that you can throw at us, it is certainly something frustrating.
You wonder what people are waiting for.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game concept.
A team builds up over time.
In the Champions League, we proved strength.
Consider Manchester City, a club that has not been able to qualify for the eighth final, since two seasons, and who has also done huge expenses!
With regard to the amounts invested, you were believed to be on the game break with 15 points of lead!
That meant that our opponents and the French championship would be left out of sight.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good in the last season, were "sweetened" by this new PSG.
This shows that the League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be the smiling winner and tell us that we have finally won them in spite of all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to depend entirely on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
For the better part, you're talking about "Zlatan addiction."
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many doors.
That's why he came and he proves he's the star of the League 1.
Everywhere he has played, he has led to the fact that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also makes it possible for all others to make progress.
How did you experience the EM 2012 with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was in my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from spending some time playing.
I've seen things out there that I've been working on.
Today I manage to make good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the Blue.
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lessons, and today we have to show exemplary behavior.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deshamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved many promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the WM.
The national coach is strict, closes the players and sets out to win.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make any comparisons.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualified us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deshamps will take the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Is this an act of aggression imposed on 16 October in Spain (1:1)?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone's used to everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a comparable game in my career.
With Bitcoin it is possible to pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties.
In addition, as often happens in these technologies, there is a political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, designed by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is a virtual currency (but in dollars, euro, etc. convertible) as well as a protocol for the safe exchange of files such as BitTorrent, which enables the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
Some thousands of websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the price of Bitcoin in June 2011 reached a maximum of 30 dollars (EUR 23), it fell to $2 five months later, before it recovered to about ten dollars today (the rates are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive when compared with world trade in real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "like the traditional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other kinds of virtual currencies such as the "Credits", which are used to advance in a video game that you can win or buy through games (and sometimes also swap back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is controlled and processed by a central authority every time.
With bitcoin, all net knots are simultaneously the account holder, auditors, cash issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose another address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A series of data relating to this transaction is signed electronically by a double encryption system.
In this way the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins traded are available in the public account book distributed throughout the network.
The decisive step is to enter this new transaction into this book.
This is done through a mathematical task that will be started on the computers, while the winner, who is a type of provisional central banker, has the privilege of adding these additional lines.
This is a fragment of the file, i.e. converting a large file into a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint.
The computer "take" the new transaction and add it a number before the whole thing is "hacked".
The goal is to find the number that produces a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check that it is correct.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay twice as fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would not be connected because the two have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task gets 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably by the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but can be divided into a hundred million set, which leaves a certain amount of space...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with any improvement in the performance of the calculation.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The websites that provide Bitcoin services were attacked and the bitcoin entries were stolen.
"The weakness used does not relate to the actual protocol," assures Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a real-money payment company and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB shall also report on the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, Bargund also points out this flaw.
Important actors such as Wikipedia reject donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others like the WordPress blog platform.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the bill and showed that almost 80% of the bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November a "mega-closure sale" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book about this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its Paytunia system corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a wireless payment with a mobile phone, but Bitcoin uses to validate transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just have to provide only one address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, Pierre Noizat, which assures that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend to identify where hierarchical systems are considered in favour of more horizontal-oriented systems.
"It will take some time to pass Bitcoin, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
In its report, the ECB also envisages re-evaluation of the various risks currently considered to be high in the event of a success of this currency.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States were expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take possession of its territory again and that the Afghan people decide their future without expecting anything from us.
In particular, we have punished Afghan farmers by viewing them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the injured and the displaced.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also farmers who refuse an armed presence abroad, such as during the Soviet era.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbek and Tadics.
Tolerant, sometimes supported by local rebels, the latter will no longer be there when the Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I observed from a tree planted with almond trees, which was financed by French loans, was properly done.
The truck and tanker convoy overrun by helicopters has reached Kabul without being attacked.
By the end of 2014, there will be no more flooding of the Taliban in Kabul.
The conditions have changed since their insurrection from 1994 to 1996.
At that time Kabul was empty and the country was overwhelmed by war because of the struggles of the various rebel groups.
At that time, their takeover was seen as a kind of liberation and return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the farmers dominated by Al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former Mudshaeddin, the Afghan Government and current Taliban have the common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into businessmen by taking over government property to sell it as a construction country to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, thus benefiting from the massive US procurement of subcontracts.
They had come to a standstill, and most of them were not even involved in the fight.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, just as those who could benefit from American donations: the capital flight is significant.
Young people have stopped the war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they had contact with the modern world and enjoyed its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one fifth of the total population.
In the cities the state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people who do not want to return to the obscurity of the single parties or to corruption will have to provide jobs.
All, including the armed parties, have mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which is a modern world, is seen everywhere.
There's an army now.
Are the authorities under whose command they will stand considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore militias in the province, which will withdraw from the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities should have benefited from some decentralization in the case of the Western nations, but by abolishing the office of the Prime Minister, which existed since the Constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make out of it a centralized state with a strong presidential force.
President Karzai does not want to carry out any foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has long been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional dustworks are not available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables nothing is produced.
The private initiative will be given priority.
In a country where war was waged for 30 years, State control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan has huge land treasures.
This further reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only on site to celebrate it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper oven on site, or without means of transport for an export over the mountains, mining is not possible.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mines of Mes Aynak, the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) at the huge Buddhist site make their excavations and remain the main employers of the province.
One day it will also be necessary to restore normal relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, largely dependent on imports and exports.
The withdrawal of the French troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: girls and boys, French Institute at universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was set up in 2012, has carried out numerous useful work and measures to repair agriculture in dozens of mining villages and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organization to try to "gain the hearts and minds" and to reach the impossible task of compatibility of aid and offensive actions.
These work, which many local workers were required to do, can help to suppress the rebellion: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase agricultural land use.
What souvenir do we leave behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will contribute to improving local living conditions, which are often very hard at a height of more than 2,000 meters.
The message contains dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from the provinces of Kapisa.
In order for farmers to get rid of the rebellion led by foreign groups, which they wish to do in their own words, it would be necessary to continue to be less, well-controlled and directly concerned civil aid for their benefit.
A Constitution With the Breaking Bar in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt, with regard to the Constitutional Declaration, which temporarily grants it unlimited power, remains more than ever divided, he has decided to put everything on a map.
To surprise everyone, he announced Wednesday that the constitutional assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had granted this plenary two additional months for the completion of its work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has been relying on a provisional, multiple-changed text, which weakens institutional stability and leads to a legal transition.
This new initiative has only provided for a stronger division of the country.
For his opponents, the president continues in his "autocratic delirium", continuing to "break his word" and "the right to walk".
On the side of its advocates, it is ensured that there is a way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period that forces the brothers to abandon their plans to explain the text section for the Egyptians.
For the presidents, it is also a way to regain their public and democratic legitimacy while the protest is going down all over the country.
After confirmations in an interview with the American weekly show Time, Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote in good faith.
While the Egyptian people with this back attack are being put to an extreme vote: " Either you agree to my draft or I retain the unlimited authority," the latter should probably end after the constitution has been adopted.
85 most of the Islamic members of this constitutional assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of Liberals have not responded to the call.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration, in mid-November they turned their backs on the view that they had not been able to apply their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted similarly.
In order to reach the decision-making capacity yesterday morning, 11 persons, deputy members, were added to all ranks.
Some are very close to the Muslims.
It is not surprising that most of the articles were adopted unanimously.
The commentators also found it entertaining that the only difference of opinion of the day... was expressed in the hour of prayer, as some members of the board felt that the pendulum of the constitutional assembly did not go exactly.
The text, which was adopted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which drew all attention to itself, is finally identical to that of the 1971 Constitution and says that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of the law".
The Salafist parties for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made a more stringent application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is proof of their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Holiness" refers to the liberals who view this only as a propaganda blow.
Because according to them, Islamization of the Constitution is taking place on other articles.
In particular, they have been given Article 220 in the light of which the University of Al-Azhar has a consultative function, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because "those who are invited to an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here you can see the first signs of a theocracy."
The fears of the Liberals are also fueled by the fact that the next director of this university should be far less consistent than the present.
"At the present time, it is not a concrete religious commitment to be recognized.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been trained in part in the French system," writes Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral work on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits, "that in relation to Article 220 there may be a plurality, since the terms used are derived from the religious vocabulary.
In particular, this refers to the "Fiqh" [Islamic Law, d.o.b.].
And in the future, the question could be raised as to the extent to which civil magistrates are competent to decide on this."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticized for the extensive powers it gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslims argue that these comparisons with the former regime have been significantly reduced.
Another point of dispute: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the military's wishes, the examination of the defence budget is not submitted to Parliament but to a national defence council.
Similarly, there will be no prohibition of civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations for the defence of human rights have required.
The latter also share their concerns about the text they see as a threat to freedom.
The existence of blasphemism is maintained and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for the right to free expression, especially for the press.
In addition, there is no longer an article on the protection of women, Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch underlines.
In your view, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to speak on TV last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the Chief of State will march Saturday.
In Israel Ukrainian tourists expect holy places, the navel of the world and a sea from the sun
The Promised Land unites itself with the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort and an unaffected nature.
The AIF calls you the five most important reasons for a visit to Israel.
Bow down before the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River in which Jesus was baptized.
It means that all those who bath in this river receive God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the turning of water into wine at a wedding feast, the going on the water, the calming of the sea storm and the fishing.
Right here Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
However, most of the shrines are located in Jerusalem.
Here the believers follow the path of suffering or the cross path of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The road begins at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretoria, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the tomb church on Mount Golgotha, where there is the crossroads, the anointed stone and the tomb of Jesus.
Here it is, according to the Christian view of the Nabel of the World, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where a Christian legend grew according to the tree from which the cross was made for Jesus' crucifixion.
In Jerusalem is also the most holy place of the Jews - the plaintiffs, the remnants of a temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave there a seed with desires that then go into fulfillment.
Take a trip to the height
The ruins of the fortress Massada constitute the remains of the secret hiding from enemies that Herod the Great built for his family in 25 C.E.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountain climbers can reach the ruins from their own strength.
Everyone else brings an airstrip to this historic summit.
In the north of the country at 1600 to 2040 meters high is the famous Hermon ski area, where it attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you get there with a shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, supposedly pagan gods lived on the mountaintop.
Visit Unique Museums
In this country there are almost 300 museums.
Not all can be visited on a single trip.
However, at least five of them should be visited.
Among them is the Israeli museum near the Knesset (Parliament).
There are old Qumran manuscripts or scrolls from the Dead Sea, found in caves in the Jewish deserts, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There the collection of works by the impressionists and expressionists is exhibited coins, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several halls of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the then visitors and bathers.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum leaders or souvenir stores.
The entry is free, and donations are rejected in principle.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters of history.
The most impressive department is the memorial for the children, who were built to remember the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the room, total darkness prevails.
Starboard.
And it utters the names of the Jews and of the countries in which they die.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something for your health
The three major areas of Israel are at the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and Oceania.
Amazingly, it is also bathed in the Red Sea in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall below 21 °C and the air is heated to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and is bathed there all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a location of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salt content and thus even carries non-swimming without problems on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors here come for treatments using salt water (natural salt) and helms, as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, and for the calming of broken nerves.
Touch the Secrets of Ageing
These secrets bring the old town of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city the famous sea route, Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia were connected.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark right here, and Perseus saved here the beautiful Andromeda, with which he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists are happy to shine through the narrow streets named after star signs.
Fortuna is to be the legend for all those who touch the walls in the gas with their star sign.
In Jaffa you can find newly mentioned couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo deadlines.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can strip through the Roman theater and conquer the fortress of the crucifixes.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the most important city in Judea and the residence of the Roman statesman, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre features evening concerts and operas today.
Bookmark List for Tourists
If you are going to Israel, don't worry about your bad English knowledge: about 30% of the Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the trip is not included in euro, but in dollars that can easily be converted into shekel (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekel).
In the city you usually get by the bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a motorway and in Haifa the country's only subway line with six stations connecting the underground with the upper city.
It's just taken it's an underground stopway.
A journey within the city costs 6 shekels regardless of the means of transport, which is sufficient to cover a journey of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath will be held in Israel on Saturday.
Markets and shops are closed from Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, and public transport rests.
And on Sunday morning the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and guesthouses, only cooked food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without cups and meals, which contain both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different dishes with ham and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, different sauces, fried bowls of purified beans and herbs (falafel) as well as fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of Israeli cities there are no stray dogs.
For this, there are many well-fed cats who wander through the streets in a cozy and inconvenient manner.
At night you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
The cats like lively places and don't say no to candy.
One car will cost between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) depending on the brand.
The insurance costs 15 dollars per day.
And bicycle rental costs 15 shekels a day.
Access cards for museums cost on average 30 shekel.
In Numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and leisure seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists entered the Promised Land, which corresponds to an increase of 51% compared to the period of comparison in 2010, prior to the lifting of visa obligations on 9 February 2011.
"The great and powerful" leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While MEPs and citizens are discussing the benefits of the law on obligatory language testing for migrants, criminals are already dealing with false certificates.
Each year 13 million guests come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Your only goal is to make money for the maintenance of the families who live in the home.
On 1 December, a law entered into force which, according to each migrant worker, required to pass a test certifying knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this scheme applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the municipal housing economy and in retail trade.
However, the tests will be required in future for all guest workers, according to the Federal Migration Authority.
This requires not only language tests, but also tests into Russian history and the principles of legislation.
Language knowledge must be demonstrated both for the purpose of obtaining and for extending the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to nationals of countries in which Russian is the official language.
This law also excludes persons who received their training certificates and diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991.
Meaning, problem and protection of rights
The whole of the exams will be under the auspices of the Puschkin Institute for Russian Language, the Russian University of People's Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can pass the tests in all cities; more than 160 corresponding centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by Members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
On the other hand, before the entry into force of the law in the press, citizens asked the following question several times: What does the whole thing actually bring?
What changes does the regulation make to show language knowledge, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
Above all, spokespersons from the Migration Authority are dealing with reducing the number of forced labour.
"Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says Viktor Sebelew, head of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan.
However, their rights must already be protected against their departure.
Only organised recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers by 90%.
Problems are faced by migrants without a profession, education, language skills and medical examination.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant without language will necessarily encounter people with evil intentions who will put him under the pretext of helping him into a dark, narrow barack, where he will endure with dozens of the same months without food and documents and will create 12-14 hours a day.
We have many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home you will be promised a promise, and when you arrive you will be deceived, your passports will be taken off and you will not receive the promised reward," says Tolib Schwaripow, head of the chief administration for labour migration of the Tajik Migration Authority.
Don't fight, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian Republics who want to earn their money in Russia admit that they do not only control the language of the country of destination but can hardly express themselves in their own language in writing.
Of course, this is not as much their fault as it is the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbek and Tadics can only provide a reasonable basic education.
For there is no money in their families to feed their children, to keep them from buying decent clothing, shoes, and school stuff.
As teenagers, these children immediately seize the first opportunity to earn money.
"It's difficult without language," they say.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Citizens' rights are highlighted in the following important aspects of the law.
Only migrants with legal status must pass the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no exam and therefore no official work.
In the meantime, most of the guest workers remain illegally in Russia.
"Welcome heart" or "Prohibited entry for unauthorised persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain an official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic fences and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
In addition, the legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made fast and only for half a thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly fake and that we are not registered, and then cases of repression arise.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tadshike Umed Huschkadamow speaks against journalists.
"Just don't see the cost of wrong papers"
Already on the day that the law came into force, it appeared that not only the registration documents of migrants could be faked.
Some false certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been issued by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The fake paper was printed with a common colour printer.
Of course, the new owners didn't get this for nothing: Every migrant who hoped to save himself the tests paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: This costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, so that certificates cannot be easily purchased, both officials and civil servants agree.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise that they will receive time for a language course for guest workers who will be tested for the first time.
In addition, new entrants without language knowledge are offered places in areas where there is no need for an active understanding of people.
Ministry of the Interior ignores illegal arms market
The share of legal weapons in crimes is extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior plans to strengthen the arms law for private arms owners.
The authorities respond to recent events: injured in shootings at weddings and seven deaths in the massacre of Moscow's lawyer Dmitri Winogradow.
The police want to ban the use of non-lethal weapons in the public and raise the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Jarowaya, and promised that the amendments to the arms law would be tabled shortly.
Not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "drawing the screws".
An open letter was published on the Internet, the author of which - representatives of various arms associations - demanded by the authorities to take away from "insensible aggravations".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very small, said the criminal judge, Vasilij Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes were committed using registered weapons over a period of six months in 2012, while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a strengthening of the law for private arms owners will not prevent criminals from serving on the black market.
Currently, according to the authors in Moscow, you can find any weapon for a little bit of money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons came through several channels on the black market.
There are five such main channels, says former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked in the Ministry of Education and General Staff for ten years.
Screenshot of a website that accepts arms orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons stolen during the battles in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baranez says.
On the second channel are illegal weapons that are stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that these include weapons stolen from both the police's arms chambers and directly from law enforcement officials.
Other illicitly sold weapons come from military weapons camps.
In many military camps, explosions often occurred.
"There is evidence that in some cases it was a firefighting to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military officer.
According to Baranez, arms manufacturers are also contributing to the black market.
"Today, there are countless private arms factories that do not withstand international competition and therefore handguns on the black market, such as in Moscow, are spreading," the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many guns and guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is an own, sometimes handmade production as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggling," explains the former military member.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels in the supply of the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Centre for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analyzed reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, Criminological Literature and publicly available data on portals on the subject of weapons.
The majority of the illegal weapons come from the military and the law enforcement authorities, according to the investigators.
Half of all weapons on the black market are there because of the "debt of those responsible who have managed to do their work with weapons", the report says.
According to researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas, 14% go back to theft in arms production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant at a gun store who does not want to be mentioned specifically assures that weapons found in illegal excavations have not been purchased for a long time since they are obsolete.
According to him, it's more common for traders to get the backup in a gun camp.
Over a Fähnrich, a gun is bought, for example, a gun of type TT.
The gun is displayed and handed over by the tooth.
"The dealer brings the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
"The police, of course, know everything about the message and therefore, if they cannot comply with the crime detection plan, periodically purchases of controls by traders that offer illegal weapons," the sales consultant adds.
"Like in luxury"
Buyers and sellers find each other most often about acquaintances.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone paid attention to me and suggested that I come to the station "Begowaja", where a person would wait for me, who would take me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
The price for the gun I only experienced there

"To provide a weapon, I need a friend who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such a friend, but I don't trust him."
There are traders on the markets, but you have to go there and spread a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who lets the daughter lose a tooth".
I'm even going to get some hits right now on a friend I trust.
He's also giving me the beatings just because he knows I'm not fucking him.
Newers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military associate Viktor Baranez tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on this subject.
The schedules have not changed according to him.
He got a photo album in which "all possible" was painted.
"I felt like a luxury shop," the military officer recalls.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try anything.
I buy not only as a potential customer but also drive with the seller into the forest, and there we set up a target disc.
"I can shoot there, and if I'm convinced that the gun has a good shot, we'll negotiate with each other," the expert describes the action.
Buy from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
No papers are needed or there are personal meetings.
"They only need the appropriate sum of money," it says in the advertisement on the website "buy guns or guns".
There users will submit your orders and ask questions.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Of course without license," user asks "Iwan" (literal quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow," says the Laconic request of "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service recently switched on countless websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons go to the service at the top of the network.
People come like hungry fish when they feed and then land in Siberia and can chew coal
Military commentator and former military associate Viktor Baranez
I have heard from the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
Responsibilities shall accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money over a bank machine.
"In response he receives a photo and a description of the hide-and-seek of the weapon," reports the press spokesman of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez stresses that you can also go out empty and come behind the grids when you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently switched on countless websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons go to the service at the top of the network.
"People come as hungry fish when feeding and then land in the Siberian labor camp and can see coal," he says.
A Macarow for 100 US dollars
For the purchase of illegal firearms, experts estimate prices from 100 to 900 US dollars.
According to Dmitrij Kislow from the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a gun from the Makrow type for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is issued in military weapons camps of middle class guards.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of crimes involving illegal weapons throughout Russia decreased by 7% from January to October 2011 to 22.9 thousand, while the number of reported cases of theft and repression related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, fast-food and supermarket workers strike
Every fourth American youth ever sits behind McDonald's cash register.
In the past days, there have been massive protests in the United States against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Still no one can predict whether the protests will continue to suffocate or whether they will be reopened soon.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organisations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests aim to set up trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy has hardly been organized jointly.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, where sales took place in the United States, attracting millions of customers, which sometimes led to handcuffs.
On that day some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their work and reached together with trade unions and left activists branches of the chain, whose target group is low and medium-income.
Walmart sells all products, from windmills over hunting weapons and batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart branches are, on average, between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many of the low-paid Walmart employees only buy at their own workplace.
Prices and product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the goods only so cheaply because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as missing fork stackers or hand scanners.
The participants of the protests on Black Friday demanded wage increases and expressed their concern that the contribution to the business health insurance had increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 an hour cannot afford this increase, they said.
Researchers at the California University in Berkeley argue that if the company increased the average wage to 12 dollars an hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
That's about 1.1% more than they're now giving for pay.
If Walmart would completely convert the wage increases to the customers, each purchase would cost it only 46 cents more in the future.
For them, it would cost them only $12.39 per year compared to today.
Walmart's supporters are pleased to note that only nine states were in protest and that they did not provide any loss to the company.
The Black Friday lasted the next day in his warehouse from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight, and in this period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, the Walmart cashiers carried out almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The company's spokesperson, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the left-hand side of Huffington Post that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees had laid down the work and the protest station had only been "another PR trick" of the union that organized the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where, however, their goal was not Walmart branches (which are not desired in this progressive city and are therefore not available so far), but McDonald's and other affordable restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of portions, and yet you don't get sick days, and you won't be paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage is based on federal and New York law at $7.25 per hour.
In fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage is increased from time to time, however, not too strong, and on average, their simple employees in New York get $8.90 an hour.
Less than she deserves no one in this expensive city.
As it's possible to come out in New York with as little money, I don't understand.
There was a time when almost a quarter of all American youths were behind the tea at McDonald's after school, but the young people were still living with their parents.
No one saw the main source of income or plant to stay there for longer.
Now I meet with McDonald's employees constantly complaining that they will come out with this reward and sometimes even have to feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal Forum, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if one does not know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests, which began at 6.30 p.m. on Thursday morning before McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks of fast-food restaurants receive a minimum salary of $15 an hour, which corresponds to more than double the current minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of trade unions in the fast-food sector.
The U.S. law prohibits the management of companies from pursuing this objective and depriving or dismissing trade union members.
On the other hand, corporate management does not make it easy for them.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food sector is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is high staff fluctuation.
Unsatisfied
There were loud protests on this day before many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a meeting on Wednesday before McDonald's at the Times Square, where some local democrats spoke, including Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and yet you don't get sick days, and you won't be paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, such as Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should support the fast-food employees together so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves!"
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the U.S. fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on site, of whom not all are employed in the fast-food sector at Wietm, where tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet possible to determine whether the funk of these protests will mobilize whole masses.
"The brain can only be overcrowded so far"
The theme of the extended reality, popular with adherents of modern technologies, is usually perceived in recent times by the lens of a special mirror.
Google first presented a working model at his annual conference in summer, then in November it was known that Microsoft had also registered a corresponding patent.
In the discussion with the leader of the Group for Interactive 3D Technologies in the Microsoft Laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it becomes clear, however, that the glasses for the company's scientists were only a transit station.
It drives the possibility to manipulate virtual objects in the air with simple hands and create virtual free space.
- Please describe briefly what research your group is doing.
- We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, but we want to extend the limits of this interaction.
So far, mankind has largely remained stuck in the phase in which pixels are worked on flat screens, which are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to predict 5-10 years and anticipate the radical changes to this interaction.
For example, Xbox consoles and Kinect sensors are progressing, and today Xbox is no longer sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in movement control.
- What else is in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, many still play on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, which has not yet been decisive.
We are trying to change this, working on real three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
However, it is necessary that not only the user but also his surroundings are recognized.
Then we could add the real world much easier by virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these veiled virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about language control?
She's popular, but isn't she overrated?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution because it raises questions about privacy, because it is not always about informing everyone about its actions and intentions.
In fact, every kind of interaction with computers is good, but every one in their specific niches.
For example, we worked in the field of the management of objects in public places on a project where we experimented with short and short, instead of entertaining gestures.
The gestures were recorded, not by the camera of the object, but by an armband that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a bracelet.
However, overall, the future belongs to mixed types of control, such as gestures and language.
- How's that?
- For example, would you ask me to give you this spray dose?
They say it and at the same time point to it.
- I'm usually just saying it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to recognize.
- Does that mean you want the user to adjust to what a machine can do at the same time and what not?
- Not necessarily, but it's about a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future we will have to work especially on developing new types of sensors that will allow us to capture reactions from people more precisely.
These can be laser sensors, for example, as they offer a good resolution in the deep, which is very important.
- What claims do you make from your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or anything else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
All current technologies are not good enough for us because the developers of the algorithms have more work to do.
The resolution must be taken into account not only along the X- and Y- but also along the Z-axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The movements of man are extremely dynamic and openly said, the current 30 fps are too little for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor in our Redmond laboratory with a adjustable processing delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work, I just needed a device like this, only without touch control and with more pictures per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "Cameras", one of which is actually an infrared sensor and the second one is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a regular RGB camera.
It does not serve to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras might solve the problem...
Or reinforce the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
It would be nice to have a flexible, kinect-like system in which we could play with different camera trends to determine how this helps us to determine a three-dimensional position.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft didn't present his glasses to the public instead of Google.
Don't you think that with regard to the application of the technology of the extended reality in everyday life, the glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course it's not pleasant always to keep a smartphone in the high hand on the way, but I think the best option would be an "changing" reality where we could switch over a cloud from the eye to the smartphone,
The glasses are a personal gadget and there is their strength (private only you can see), but also their weakness, because an extended reality by the glasses prevents you from working together with others on virtual objects.
- Let's imagine for a long time that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem often pointing to the critic of this idea: There is no sensitive reaction!
Hands feel nothing at all!
What answers do your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures, I often talk about the fact that the extended reality represents the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think that the eighth breakthrough could be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as something unusual projection background.
She's taking great pressure!
But there are also technologies that are actually focused on giving the "images in the air" something hand-held, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasonic rays at a certain point where the finger is located, a feeling that is at the moment but is still so weak that someone pushed over the handballs.
There are also bands for the wrist, which affect the nerve movements in the fingers, this is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried to list the brain?
Does it make you think it feels what it should feel when it just sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another task that we will have to deal with for a long time, namely a person who is physically in a closed room to believe, it is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we work on concepts with treadmills (other than in fitness studios), moving platforms as well as large balls.
So far, the brain can only be over-listed moderately, and many years of work are still ahead of us.
This is exactly what makes the work in the field of virtual reality so attractive to a researcher: We are only at the beginning of many topics.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avantgarde", dedicated to the city's inhabitants who form the Avantgarde of Art and Culture.
Already high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg Art Scene have landed on the list, whose successes go beyond the city's borders and often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city is known to Kirill Miller, the red-dressed bartender, who is once found at the Russian Museum, once at the summer garden, sometimes at scene meetings or at Vernissagen.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are also displayed, they attract large masses of people.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of Petersburg's Avantgarde at the end of the 1980s or early 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and magics by his presence on the street a smile in the face of his fellow citizens and provides them with good pay.
Recently he took a triangle and became a Petersburg triangle player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artist's character, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I have chosen the color Red as fashion designer, which blends with the optics and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, image advisors and society.
In society everything that differs from the grain orm, aggressions and bad behavior is called out.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to a conversation.
- When did you know you had to become a painter?
- At an exhibition at the cultural palace in Newskij, where my works were exhibited.
I understand I have to go this way.
Then the time of the old but not officially recognized painters then ended, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I was friends with the painters of the new generation, that is, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; this was the beginning of "Pushkinskaja 10", and then it was only a conclusion.
It attracts me to the theater, to the fashion, to the music, actually to everything, except literature.
It was important for me to be at the heart of Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in Puschkinskaya 10, and there until the renovation work there was a musical-art club for the Bohemian, the house of the Petersburg Bohemian.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazz, and I also remember how Schnur came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Snur and his friends sing simple songs to playback, wear tight trikots and also belong to the composer Igor Wdowin today.
When the group started playing live, it became a Leningrad.
Trachtenberg moderated many programs prior to the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great career, but he learned the basics with us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also have their origins in the art clinic.
Our employees and family guests went there.
I'm a hero of the last century when culture meant something else.
In 2000, there was a survey in the press of the award of "the personalities of our city".
I won in the category "Artists of the Year", so I got to the top.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a person of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unrecognizable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and make it clear the currentness and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and prepares to be that way.
In a clown, it's all confused and loses its tragedy.
I love the Grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let us save the world by prescribing that everyone has to dress completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and is oriented towards the outside and not the inside of the human.
But maybe you shouldn't give a man a hand, but you should slap him in the face.
The deception disappears by wearing it.
We recently saw you in the role of the city's triangular player.
Who if I don't?
- Can commercial art also be beautiful?
- Today, commercial art must be careful, considerate and flattery.
We see the collapse of cultures.
In the past, the people formed great groups: the Bohemians loved one another and the simple people loved one another.
Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar note that everybody likes.
Now you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Now every cult star has about 100 adherents.
- The performances of Stas Michailow come in thousands!
- He's got women leaving, there's a role for the sex-social sphere.
For cultural reasons 300 people come and not 10 thousand come, therefore there is less management, money, and everything goes on.
I have attachments, and the most important thing is not to cheat them and not to destroy the achievements.
In my youth, I painted such pictures that were hanging with a collector even in a series of works by Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that usually only come at the end of my career.
Today there are often misunderstandings.
It means spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumer consumption has no culture at all, which is quite different.
I am a man of past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
That's the culture I'm defending.
- Kirill, what's up with Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
It is said: servants of culture.
But not every one of them can deal with culture.
It was different with the real roses, because the roses may not understand much of culture, but they understood that real experts are needed.
In Moscow there are currently good advisers.
In Petersburg we have what the experts might be, but they are blocked from the path, as there is a need for higher-ranking experts who properly assess the first and clear the way for them.
Now it's just its own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters therefore have to look for other museums.
- What's the matter with you, Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not the capital of culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding nutrient.
On our rocks art can only grow hard.
We need a cultural diet, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not correct.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
That's much less for us.
Art must be modern again, as at the beginning of the previous century.
The project is funded from grants from the city of St. Petersburg
Born in the World All
Earth in danger.
Heat or collision with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earth’s inhabitants on board are looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, is the important question of how we can plant ourselves in the masslessness or on the planet of replacement?
I do not think there are many options.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could have at least hypothetically lived on.
"That is Mars and Venus," says the scientist of the Astronomeric Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on the March are relatively life-friendly, on the surface of the Venus there is a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would be possible only in large heights or in the orbit of Venus, that is, in all.
The question of replanting in all was first addressed by the researchers with regard to the flora.
Already half a century ago experiments were carried out with plants.
The fourth generation of the heirs raised in the orbit did not differ in the least from the earthly species.
It followed the cultivation of insects, more precisely of small fruit flies (Drosophila), in the orbit.
In 1979, guard leaders were sent to the world all to investigate how gravity affects the development of Embryos.
It develops a completely normal kitchen.
But then the problem starts.
"The problem is that the cook must stop; it must be able to stand on his legs and start moving," explains RAN, Vladimir Sychew, laboratory director of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems.
Without solid ground, the kitchens go wild.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns completely faded.
The kitchens did not respond to light and noise.
Four days later, they just died.
"Two times we let the cooks slip and then put the whole thing in, because it's just impossible to work with them there," Vladimir Sychew says to the failed experiment with the cakes in everything.
The last cub with animals flew into the orbit 16 years ago.
In spring 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, the biosatellite "Bion" will only contain the same sex species.
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized into everything.
In principle, there was nothing special about it.
"It was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research has to be continued," observes Vladimir Sychew.
After landing, the world councils grew up.
The problem of reproduction could not be solved directly in space until now.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are cut off from their natural habitat simply cannot follow their breeding course.
Unlike animals, humans could do so in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
In ethical considerations, such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying all over the world for 50 years.
The biggest risk was in Tereskowa.
The most valuable possession mankind has is the female organism.
Our moose flew away from it, and no one on earth could have answered the following question: Does it exceed the space flight?
Will she be able to bring a child to the world after this flight?
"Finally, no one answered this question," says Space Veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonautin, Valentina Tereskova, gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolayew, was also Cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in All, Swetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in the orbit and even performed work outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
However, there is still a risk.
We have only very few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even for flights to the Orbit," concludes Kosmonaut Waleri Poljakov, the hero of the Soviet Union and the hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet mankind must look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the production of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaborator in the preparation center of the cosmonauts is a mandatory station during the preparation of the flight.
Here in a wet state, the cosmonauts win routines for work in open space.
The water represents the gravity.
Even if adults feel the water as pleasant, it is a strange environment; but infants feel the water as a natural element.
It's like the little ichtyander would testify that life in the country grew to the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in the womb of the mother in the fruit water for about 9 months, and that it can be more easily used to water.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth until the first swim just went 2 weeks.
"It's too little time to forget something," says Marina Aksenowa.
While for a newborn child, gravity is thus a much more natural state, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the state of gravity, the abdominal and thigh muscles are formed very quickly and thus also decreases the ability to express the child.
Well, we're dealing with the birth control.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to squeeze the child out.
"But what happens then?" says the not insignificant question by Waleri Poljakow.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the Earth's pull, the organism cannot train the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put in a load suit as an adult in the orbit.
He will simply miss what is essential to his life.
"This experiment, which we take together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring a disabled, totally inappropriate person into the world," says Igor Pestow, head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems RAN.
So far, the birth of children in the whole world is just a theory.
But at some point it will become reality if the earth’s inhabitants break up into a distant planet in their spaceships, which will be the home for their all-born descendants.
NKÜ-Chief: Control of the black system failed by policy debt
However, in the context of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate laws, but its application is lagging behind.
In the conference for Aktuálně.cz says dies der Vice-President des Höchsten Kontrollamtes (NKU), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be properly applied - and this is not the case in my opinion," Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be a joint control by Czech and German examiners.
As a negative example of practice, he leads Prime Minister Petr Nečas's approach to the so-called "black system".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls - so is the system now prohibited or allowed?
"But a law must have its validity, and if something is legally prohibited, then it cannot simply come to the president of the government, and the control office, whose duty now is to control compliance with the law, is hampering its activities," Kala points out.
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee of the Chamber of Representatives, you discussed a joint Czech-German project, in which the laws of the two countries on public procurement were compared.
What were you going to do?
This is a parallel test that we started about two years ago.
Simply put, it is because European legislation determines how public contracts are to be handled. It is based on national legislation and, finally, there is still the actual practical application.
We have compared all of this to each other, and although the examination has not yet been completed, we have found very interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws are perhaps even a bit "stricter and more perfect", but the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to re-establish new and more precise rules, and it is also necessary to deal with the actual application of the law.
How much help can the project be? What is the result for you from this project?
It is precisely such a joint control that we can stop constantly trying to perfect the laws and reduce and austere thresholds if this is not apparent to be particularly positive.
Economics means acquiring a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding illegal prosecution or even criminal action.
But the decrease in thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we also achieve this goal.
Maybe it's even so that we only charge the system in this way with excessive "paper cram", and those who look for holes in the system have much easier to use the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They discuss the problems of the practical implementation of the Czech surrender law.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority like our NKU here, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German pendant for the NKU is the Federal Court of Auditors, which has a similar structure as we do and also has a college that is only formed something different. However, in principle, both authorities work similar.
The competences are also comparable to some extent, but Germany is a state of the state, i.e. that there are these accounting courts in the individual federal countries - in which the German system differs from ours.
The BRH can only control federal funds, which corresponds to our state resources.
Public funds managed by the districts and municipalities are under the control of the Courts of Auditors.
As for the German legislation, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would only like to compare this without specific details. However, Germany is often referred to as an example, but it cannot be said that Germany is better at all.
Does this mean that the examiners are better there?
That is not true, but as it is said: I do not particularly like such comparisons.
To this end, it should be noted that those countries that are an example for us also have problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have had anything to do with our authority, would they?
As for the Czech legislation, what was the significance of the renewal of the surrender law for your authority, do you already feel any impact?
In view of the fact that this novelle is only in effect for a short time, it has not yet been effective in our trials.
Since our controls take place subsequently, it is necessary to assume a certain delay here.
So far, we are experiencing effects in the preparatory phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control instrument "Recognition of the risks of inequality" and examined and analysed with this almost 14,000 public contracts - the changes will naturally impact here, as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, etc.
Do you see the adoption of this law rather positive, or is the system being charged with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope that this adoption will be confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules are "stricter" and can no longer be complied with.
Under the previous rules, the persons subject to an examination shall be accountable to the carrier (e.g., in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) for any non-compliance with the law on the award of a breach of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense, then, to make the law even more restrictive?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system and not punish those who have made a formal error that does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system only puts bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out here?
Let us first say which way is not objective.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not satisfy entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system now prohibited or allowed?
However, a law must have its validity, and if something is legally prohibited, then it cannot simply come to the Government President, and the control office, whose duty now is to control compliance with the law, cannot interfere with its activities.
He can say, "We change the law and allow things to happen," but he can't say that we do it as if there was nothing.
The surrender law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain procedures - and this is also true for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, however, it is also tragic when the supplier is excluded with the best offer only because of form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be properly applied - and that is what I think is lacking.
On the streets there are individual ice sheets, but mostly they are dry.
On the Czech streets there are partly snow and ice sheets.
Mostly, however, the roads are well manageable, with increased caution being offered.
KaribaKarlsbad
In the Karlsbad district, the streets were well maintained this morning, each with snow and ice.
The temperatures drop to -5 to -10 °C, it should become somewhat warmer over the day.
In the region it is no longer cut, and in the deeper heights there is only a thin snowboard.
However, there are about 30 cm of snow on the slopes of the mountain of Erzberg.
According to the District Street Guard, a limited view prevailed due to fog.
The rapid road R6 and the road routes of the first road class in the region are currently unrestricted.
However, attention is paid, for example, to bridges on which roads are required and smooth.
At the same time, all roads of the second and third road classes, including the mountain roads, are accessible.
However, on these roads there is a partial requirement or an out-of-the-way snowstorm.
In particular, increased attention is therefore required in the higher levels.
District of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some streets of East Bohemia there is a danger of ice-creams, in higher levels and in the mountains there is still an out-of-the-art snow story on the streets, the road and highway DG is sharing on its website.
The road championships warn drivers from ice-creams, which can occur especially in higher positions in the district of Pardubice.
In particular, it is possible to land on the roads of the second and third classes of roads in the districts of Lanškron, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Myto.
Streets I/43 and I/34 in Svitavy are treated chemically.
Snow lies especially on the streets in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlicé mountain.
An excellent snow cover is located on the streets of the Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov district.
In Eastern Bohemia, it is mostly sunny or hotter today, and it remains largely unbeatable.
The temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, there is a weak wind.
Pilsen County
The streets in the Pilsen district are well accessible today, but local attention is being paid, and the route is to adapt to the weather.
This is cool in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point.
Since it has been cut before and the temperatures have fallen, it can come to ice level on the streets.
Locally it is also cloudy, but the view will improve in the course of the day.
These data are from the District Road Championships.
The D5 motorway is practically unrestricted, but increased attention is recommended by the road championships between 80 and 131 kilometres.
First-class roads are mostly dry but frozen.
However, in the south of the districts Pilsen and Tachov it can be cut down to ice cream.
The second and third road tracks are wet, and therefore the reference here also applies to possible sections required.
Drivers should be particularly careful on the less frequent roads in the area of Böhmerwald.
Bezirk Olomouc
With snowy weather today, drivers must count towards altitudes in the Olomouc district.
After the use of jet vehicles, snowmatsch remains on the pass Červenohorské sedlo as well as on the road towards Videlský kríž.
Night snowflakes forced the road championships to use, in the Thumperk circle, according to the road administration's data, about 3 cm of snow.
In other areas of the district, the roads are usually unrestricted.
"In the Thumperk circle, there are still snowfalls in the heights.
On the pass Červenohorské sedlo, the drivers must count towards Jeseník with snow," said a staff member of the Šumperk road administration today in front of the agency ČTK.
Their colleagues in the Jeseník district also had to leave at night, according to their data, the streets are free and wet to the heights after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc district the roads are unrestricted, but in the Šternberk district the drivers must drive carefully in forest sections, as the roads are still wet here.
Ustí nad Labem district, Liberec district
In northern Bohemia, the road championships report several bad road sections.
In addition to several places with snow or ice level, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice is blocked in the Ústí n.K. area according to traffic police data.
The temperatures are also below zero, so snow and ice are kept on the streets. No problems are reported from the depths, especially south-east of the Bohemian Central Mountain, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic disturbances have been reported so far.
Ice cream is reported from the district of Štětí in particular.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this in the night - over the day rain and melting snow, in the night cloudless sky and frost.
Bad traffic conditions are reported by the main lines and by the I/13 road at the border of the districts Ústí n.L. and Liberec.
The closure of the road between Telnice and Knínice was necessary due to axles pressed from the snow elastus to the road.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think should happen in less than a month of the world transition?
This is one of those disaster reports that we want people to jump on.
With our band The Tap Tap, we are making fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the world from going down.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the decline of the world.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
This is a nationwide benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
For this we want to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, which is projected to end on December 21st at 11:10 in the morning.
On the day before, i.e. on December 20, three concerts will take place at the same time as 21:00 in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concert should be at about the time the Maya calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, located in a time zone 12 hours before us.
Who's the source of this idea?
Originally probably from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to collect enough positive energy to prevent the world from going down, but we also want to reflect, together with the public, on the condition in which we once gave this world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and keys against the world's decline, with their purchases through www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap has also included the so-called Hymne against the World Fallout with the title "World Fallout" along with other interpreters.
Already today, the anthem on YouTube is very popular. Will it also be pronounced on the benefit concerts?
Of course, and to the end, provided that everything fits and the world transition does not take place...
The hymn is to be sung at the same time by all the performers on all three concerts.
In addition, the hymns will be transmitted live in a direct switch from the Czech TV.
The text of the hymn comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main figure of Jesus in the video, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to cooperate with both of them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we realize many beneficial events and concerts...
We are trying to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It has shown that most of us are interested in and have fun.
What is the purpose of the salvation of the concerts against the decline of the world?
For the establishment of the barrier-free educational centre Studio, where we have been working with the club Tap at the Jedlikka Institute for six years.
The students of the Jedlikka Institute are regularly attended by lecturers who assist them in various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to find the readers, we want to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlikka Institute, a building is to be built in which we will then engage with this project.
At each concert, several groups and interpreters appeared.
On what criteria have you chosen this?
We wanted to put together a programme that addresses all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Lesbians Support, Illustrators with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý appear.
Find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "great events" also planned for the future?
In May, for the first time at Prague Spring, we also prepare an interesting program with interesting guests for this concert.
Next year we would also like to take part in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are in the United States - would also like to connect this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not very small, so far you have already appeared in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
However, The Tap Tap is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you cope with these trips logistically and organisationally?
It's not as bad as it looks at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchair drivers, i.e. wheelchairs must be carried in the luggage compartment. Besides, of course, we have to bring a lot of tool bags and other luggage...
Nonetheless, it has always worked out without problems, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us, that sometimes I have been partially surprised.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your travel abroad, you have a comparison of what it looks like in individual countries with freedom of movement, how you deal with people with disabilities etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than we did, we were witnesses in Russia that everything in the east is still in its beginning.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is absolutely not a disabled person. It is still unusual if someone in the wheelchair is alone in the city centre.
It is not even natural to offer a wheelchair, for example, in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to point to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we have to recover from the developing countries?
There's still a lot of things that we hang behind...
However, it should be noted that improvement of the situation still depends on the efforts of the affected.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common for people with serious disabilities to move independently in public space, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
However, it is not exactly customary that a larger group of disabled people are actively involved in social events there, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public and freedom of the press is a matter, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only cases of particularly desirable personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular. But if we go back a few years: What have you motivated in 1998 to set up a band?
At that time, I started as a nurse at the Jedlikka Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in doing something intensive.
And since I am a musician myself and I play saxofon, I have set up a music AG together with a colleague.
Well, and in time, it's like our moderator, Ládźa Angelović, is being cared for, something out of control (laughing).
But the band was only known in recent years, am I wrong?
It is true that cooperation with well-known singers has helped us; we have also begun actively advertising for ourselves.
We have become aware that if you do something and this is not to be seen outside, your own performance does not exist in a sense.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also provide good readers, high-quality devices, etc.
Was it your goal to bring it this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to deal with things differently.
In the show business today often copies each other.
This is logical in its way, as everything new is carefully viewed and accepted only after a longer time.
There are only a few really unique things, and I dare to claim that Tap Tap belongs to it.
The first impression the viewer has most of is of course compassion; that is only natural...
But this pity is absolutely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not alone and abandoned beings that we should regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop if they have the necessary means to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed, this is not just progress for themselves, but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you must not compromise in many things, and you must also require some discipline.
This is, in my opinion, quite normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and if they find that they have twice a week to try, they have to finish the preparation stages and spend a lot of time on concert trips, then the excitement quickly evaporates with many.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of these were from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only ein enziger: Lādīa Angelovic.
We're an open group, people come and go.
Whoever has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome with us.

Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was admitted to a ministerial meeting of the member countries of the European Space Organisation ESA as the twentieth member of this Space Authority. Poland is thus the second member of the former East Block (to the Czech Republic, which became an ESA member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
The way of Poland into space began freely much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos spiritists engaged in space travel, which they did not always understand.
I recall here, for example, the lecture by A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 in the Warsaw Observatory, where the author presented thought from his pioneering work "Introductory to Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold, and after years Šternfeld still remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomi had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won the Rep-Hirsch Prize, founded by Robert Esnault-Pelteria and André Louis Hirsch, in 1934, for "Enter into the Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's world-renowned contribution to the development of space travel has been praised, among other things, for having been named after him one of the craters on the side of the moon.
Already in 1925 a railway station was built in Poland for which a rocket was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rockets should be used to start or brake the drains.
The information to this effect comes only from the contemporary press.
In 1933 the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-operated missiles.
The research work was conducted by the Institute of Komórka Techniki Uzfrijenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustav Mokrzyckiegi.
It is apparent from the documents submitted that the research has progressed to the stage of practical testing.
The research was then interrupted freely by the intrusion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, in the press of Ing. Rohoziński, the design of a photo-electric hunting kit appeared, and the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda voietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Lviva-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the rocket drive.
Shortly before the war, all projects on the military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the Transitional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Committee Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of work, its work was completed from the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space travel were published after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polish Towarzysto Astronautique) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this company was made in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problem, in which four extensive articles of space travel were dedicated.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to establish a space company.
At the time, there were the first satellite technology projects, and it was to be seen that the research of the universe would have a future.
In its early years in 1956, the Polish Space Company PTA sought to join the International Space Federation established in 1951, and in fact the PTA became a regular member in the fall of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA president, Kazimier Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), was Vice-President of the International Federation for Space Navigation.
He had this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PTA has been involved in the development of the most successful meteorological rockets (Rakieta Meteorologicalzna), the first Polish rockets for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first started on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of RM-1A was built, and began in 1959 in the Błędów Desert Flight Tests with the two-stage RM-2 rocket.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rockets should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used to monitor high winds.
In 1962, however, further development was slowed down.
A successor to the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) of this rocket have been developed, which differ in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport space of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B over 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C over 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight altitude was 37 km at all three types.
In 1965 to 1968, the Meteor 2 rockets were developed at the airport, the first of which began flight testing in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
Then the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning that Poland's accession to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, followed by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites in the intercosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut in the Czech state of Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the Law on non-profit works is no solution.
Last week the Constitutional Court raised the law on non-profit works.
This decision called for a lively discussion in the public.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that individual economies are in a permanent conflict.
This is because the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unscrupulous financial speculation.
Due to the large differences in the value of work (wages) it comes to price tensions.
Under this concept, a state in which the manufacturer seeks to maintain economic competition through the import of cheap goods, by "substituting" competition, in order to increase its market share and increase its profits.
For most companies, this means either to move their production abroad or to buy it cheaply, or to give up their business. The result is a high unemployment rate in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since private capital does not bear social responsibility and therefore does not bear any responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, it is necessary to increase public expenditure.
This situation is further reinforced by the fact that the businessmen are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thus replace the overall economic and social damage they cause.
This situation is generally known, so that concrete statistics are out of date.
The unconcerned practice of private capital creates in the individual economies a situation where governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus lure foreign capital into the country.
In other words: Governments deliver their own population regardless of the social consequences to private capital.
This is particularly reflected in amendments to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to compel the public to accept the dictatorship of private capital in particular in the wage field.
This is due to economic pressure on long-term unemployment, to the reduction of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
For several years in Germany, there have been public food bills for poor people who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In order to increase the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases where workers receive such low wages that the state must raise its income to the minimum.
Such a scandal was also detected in the case of auxiliaries employed in the German Bundestag.
The savings measures in practically all EU countries will undoubtedly be extended to the same state where people are forced to migrate under the pressure of a catastrophic disruption to their social level (as was the case in the 19th century) or to work for a hungry wage on the part of society, hoping that private investment capital will eventually flow into the country.
This naturally raises the question of where this capital comes from?
When it comes from another EU country, poverty only migrates from one country to another; or capital remains exactly the same because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or Africa, employees work for a fraction of European wages.
This is all about Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim to be far too strong that the state is not allowed to take part in its own economy and that the planning economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital is strictly dependent on its position that the state cannot interfere with the economy.
But then one has to wonder whether private capital influences politics and thus the entire state in its own selfish sense or even drives.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The evidence for this is the existence of a practically omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all countries.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual preference, legislation in which virtually everything is appropriate, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is that a Ministry of State is entrusted with the development of draft legislation by private, close-to-industry law firms with lack of financial resources.
These draft laws will then be adopted on the Bundestag.
All violence will then no longer come from the people as it announces the Western Constitutions, but from strong financial groups who prefer their own interests.
Apparently, the liberal democracies now quickly find themselves in a situation as they describe Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state has long been understood in the fall, and the offices have been occupied with violence.
Against butter money, through illegal exploitation of advantages or with stones and swords.
The corruption went unhindered, and the people went with already bought votes for election" ... "People with character do not apply for office, so that the state had no consulate for eight months as a result of this downturn" ... "You have really started to talk about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation is a single inheritance, and that a strong man must be elected" ... Appian thought about Pompey, but then the strong man was Caesar, who replaced democracy permanently through the single inheritance.
As it turns out, today’s society is based as well as in ancient times on the pointless preference of its own advantage, without regard for all social interests.
Private capital is no longer capable of recognizing and implementing the benefit for the whole company from its nature.
The result, today as then, is an unprecedented decade of the elites who do not in the least try to reform in depth.
We must therefore seek the cause for the emergence of fascism and communism in the free liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today's perspective, the decline in this regime in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a break in which the next round is already taking place.
Especially catastrophic is the fact that today's elites are facing the possible loss of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters whose witnesses we have already witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them from older and newer history, in complete ignorance.
The repeal of the Law on non-profit works is not a solution here, at least not a lasting one.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms which increase the state's participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: Work of Chaos.
"...that nothing arises from violence, or could ever arise," Sting sings in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the refrain reads: "...so that we do not forget how destructive we are."
"If my sons didn't want war, there was no," says the dying Gutel Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a number of reactions.
They stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defence, while they call the Palestinians terrorists; the others support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and call the State Israel terrorist.
I do not want to write in this place about who is guilty of this constantly recurring wave of murder and who is the victim; finally, the inhabitants of Israel today, including the self-government areas, have been brought into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence themselves.
It is for me to open the reader's eyes to the scenes, to see who the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small spot country in the Middle East are particularly helpful.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from these and from my own understanding of who or what group of people has a significant influence on the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a story of the struggle around power.
In any age we can make Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is whether it was really always those personalities who determined their steps autonomously, or whether someone was behind their throne who directed their actions toward a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we are living in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power resulting therefrom has not been created within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families is a special highlight that could be called the head of the crack (I don't know if anyone else is standing over them, but I don't exclude this) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Of course.
The first press agency (Reuters) was purchased by the Rothschilds in the 90s of the 19th century in order to link their name with high-criminal acts, in whose background the strengthening of their power, the increase of their wealth or both stood.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all of the world's central banks, and against the countries where they are not involved in the central banks, they wage wars or rebel against them (before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5 countries, after which the Ghaddafis crash remained only four others, while Russia has, in the meantime, been subject to its central bank of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to oppose this family had to pay for it with his life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank, began to issue his own (speaking: state) bank notes during the civil war and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own bank notes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was murdered in 1963; MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to report to the Fed on the outbreak of the World Economic Crisis in 1929.
In the years 1859 - 1871, the global powers of the Rothschilds led to the formulation of a plan to disband three world wars by Albert Pik, a 33rd freeman and thus the highest degree of recognition.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchist states of Europe, the second war should in particular break the colonial rule of Great Britain, and the third war should reduce the world population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their conveniences and their luxury and would not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than the precedent here) and eventually lead to the takeover of absolute power.
The method with which the group of the richest families works with the Rothschilds at the top is the trigger of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order from chao - order from chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the foundation of the FED, so that crises such as those triggered by them in 1907 do not repeat themselves).
After they had succeeded in triggering the First World War in Sarajevo through the assassination of the Habsburg Crownlord Ferdinand, they destroyed the Russian Empire by the Bolshevik Revolution.
The first world war ended with the sudden, military and economic unwarranted capitulation of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian Empire), and then the resolution of the Central European Great Power was carried out in Austria-Hungary.
In order to facilitate the development of the Second World War, the bankers, through the policy, created a latent conflict situation by supporting Germany with giant war repairs, thus creating the prerequisite for poor masses, so that they had to undermine the Germans only a sufficiently strong leader who offered the guilty and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the state of the nations of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, who should take up the function of a fifth column and also take up the warfire.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the foundation of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought the establishment of a Jewish state, as much as possible in the historic territory of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour Declaration created the prerequisite for mass immigration from Jews to Palestine; it came to first encounters with the Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler was released from the chain where the international banks had initially held him, or whether everything went according to plan, it was only difficult to estimate, in any case the suffering of the European Jews in concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war repairs against Germany prepared the ground for the Second World War, the calling of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
If the international bankers succeed in disposing of this war, the Jewish people will be like the victims of World War II in the front line, this time together with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also international (one can only think of how people are divided into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim of the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelis, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, while at the beginning the desire of the individual and their pursuit of global power?
There must be a distinction between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel as well as the people, exclusively their own candidates, are to be elected.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascism-based, internationally-based politician who is doing everything in his power to wage war with Iran, who, in view of Iran's membership in Shanghai's Organization for Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly expand into a global conflict, and in which because of Iran's control over the only 2 miles wide road of Hormus, more than 20% of global oil supplies could lead to global economic destruction.
In what light do the words of David Rockefellers of 1994 appear: "The only thing we need is an all-embracing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In her imagination, the new world order is a world of men and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serve a small group of financiers.
A world in which every newborn is implanted a chip to subject this being to total control.
"And it makes that the little ones and the great ones, the rich and the poor, the free and the slaves all give a sign on their right hand or on their foreheads that no one can buy or sell, because they have the sign, namely the name of the beast or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom! Who has understanding, who exceeds the number of the beast.
For it is the number of a man, and his number is sixty-six hundred."
The film Argo: If it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of protesting Islamic students occupied the US Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For their release, they demanded the delivery of the lost shamada Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who had preserved the patronage over his regime for decades.
For the American government there was no positive way out of this situation - they could not afford to throw the chess overboard, as this would have seriously damaged the trust of their allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was not able to carry out the liberation of hostages in Iran, where the revolution in the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent failure in the violent attempt to free hostages only made things worse.
Finally, the diplomats arrested were released after 444 days after negotiations were conducted by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages gave rise to a wave of solidarity as well as anti-Iran attitudes.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the US a small partial victory.
Just before the message was captured, six messengers escaped.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees from Iran; it helped them to discover their true identity extravagance - they traveled with Canadian passports as members of a film staff who allegedly visited the country of Trehorte for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by the expert for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood cooperation.
In order to be credible, articles on this film project appeared in journals, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have been kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks Film is a special combination of several film genres.
On one side he is a realistic polytriller, but also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful housepiece such as the movie Ocean's Eleven.
This changes the mood levels in the film - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence are shown iconic contemporary photographs, and also in the filming of the same situations there are no big differences).
On the other hand, the loose passage from Hollywood, which comes ironically and easily.
And then there are still the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men wearing suits at the discussion table, on the office floor, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has succeeded in a remarkable relaunch of his career with this film.
From a scoffed actor he has become a respected director, and also as an actor he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third movie after Crime No children's game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller City without mercy (2010).
At the same time, it's a reflection of the first film that doesn't play in the director's home Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was part of the features that removed the previous films of this director from the standard Hollywood.
However, the reflection also proves this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the introductory sequence of the storming of the message is very impressive in its clarity, and still conveys the sense of confusion and unpredictableness that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
A similar effect is also achieved with his team in fictional scenes (the wrong filmboard on a pool in Tehran).
Too much action in many places
The director also had to resolve that the story does not actually offer many exciting scenes in the film's sense.
With the few, however, he works quite successfully, sometimes helping the reality - which does not always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the threatening crisis at the airport in Tehran is turned away from a phone call in America, or also the chase on the runway, seem to be something artificial).
Argo's weakness is his too wide scattering, which is contingent on the need to show too much action in many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their figures would have earned more space, and thus they are far from alone in the film.
Afflecks film thus loses some strength. It is a film that you can pursue with a certain interest, and in doing so you can go through the design and the retro-style that comes to mind on a thriller from the 1970s.
However, enthusiasm only makes him difficult.
However, as a reminder of a piece of history that is still alive to this day and as a proof of how the ideas of the Almighty and the All-Knowing Secret Services have been conveyed, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for blowing air balloons, bananas and circuses
This year, the server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which calls for an annual survey of the most absurd bank fees, decided to organise the competition "the most absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"On this idea, the EU's recent plan to introduce a 40% women's share in the management of large European firms," said Patrick Naker, who is responsible for the organisation of this survey, against Právo.
For example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the harmonisation of the insurance tariffs for men and women is one of the most absurd.
Until then women enjoy life insurance an advantage because they objectively pose a lower risk to insurance companies.
"More incredible revenues from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place until the end of February 2013," Nafer told us.
The controversial EU regulations include, inter alia, the mandatory mixing of bioethanol into fuels which are naturally harmful, the further prohibition of the reliable mercury thermometer only because they contain a relatively small amount of this substance, or also the directive on the size of chicken cages, because of the fact that eggs were significantly more expensive this year.
Criticism has in the past also generated the actual ban on the use of the term "butterflies" or the ban on the sale of traditional candles.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU Apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose claims in Brussels are usually represented by one or more Member States (this is how the Czech Republic, for example, is currently trying to implement the claims of the Czech banks with veto.
Lobby's interest was also that bananas of the highest trading class in the EU should be at least 14 cm long and should not have "curricular anomaly".
The European Commission defended itself with the argument that it would only harmonise the uniform national standards that would impede trade.
The EU's standards on fruit and vegetables have already been balanced against the resistance of some countries, pointing out that the previous directives would lead to food shortages.
A candidate for victory in this survey may be the EU regulation of last year, which according to air balloons has to be provided for sale with the indication that children under eight years of age are not allowed to blow up the air balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU called for an American study that, according to balloons, is the leading cause of the death of children.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using annual market shares.
Curious incomes are also available at home
It is also rather absurd that a directive which concerns European officials themselves - anyone who takes up an official role in the EU should not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the topic for Greece and should instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server also nominated the EU Regulation on the extent of food stocks in the territory of a Member State in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire in addition to the absurdities.
The EU thus established the maximum volume of food stocks that could be present on the day of our EU accession in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic then exceeds, for example, the fixed volume for mushrooms, for which we were threatened with a high fine.
The survey organizers were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or by the idea of making funds for applications for funding.
These ideas were freely not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged because we do not have a sea.
We will apply for compensation from the EU," said then Minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the wheaters were very high and the state stocks were overrun as a result of so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros, according to the Palace.
The European Commission finally opposed the Czech Republic to the extent that it organised an invitation to tender for the purchase of cereals from countries which do not have access to the sea.
Funding for applications for funding was offered to the municipalities by the Ministry for Regional Development under the leadership of Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), which should be dedicated to funds for setting up funding applications in Brussels.
EU: Bizarre Regulations are the exception
In the Member States, regulations are easily criticised for the objective of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also for the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole, but some experts believe that they deserve greater recognition.
A more serious problem, according to these experts, is the EU funding for projects which have nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but which have been forced into the budgetary negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions also call for the fact that the Czech Republic, like other Member States in Brussels, has to fight for the right to use specific terms of traditional products and does not always win this fight.
Although after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tróžky", the Inländerrum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition returns to us until the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename "Tuzemák".
The name rum may only be used for products of sugar tube distillate, not for products of sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of the world-famous cheese varieties Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker Marzipan or the Parmachinken are now also the Karlsbader Zwieback, the Carpfen from Pohorëlice and Třeboň, or the Saazer Hoppen.
With an EU brand, the Pardubicer live cakes or the hořicer rolls can be brushed.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," Okamura claims.
Mr Senator, how do you think you can run for the President's office?
I'm not talking about being a senator or president.
If everything in our country worked out smoothly, I would no longer be running anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the Republic has been plundered for 20 years, how thieves go around freely, while people are raised taxes and pension age.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
But if I see something that I don't like, then I'm trying to propose a solution to change this.
And since I am over 40 years old, and independent and partisan, I have no other way to influence things than to run for the office of a senator or president.
In the Senate you made it and then went straight to the castle.
Don't you turn your voters back?
I've been telling myself all along that I'm going to take the fight around the castle after the Senate elections.
Later, I specified this and said that I would be running for the President's office if I were elected senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
I need as much influence as possible and as much mandate as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that as a people in the kneip and in front of the television, but that makes everyone who wants to change something.
In addition, the media who want to rob one of honor and who lie the freedom of the word with freedom.
About me, for example, I was claimed to be a journalist or an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
The fight around the castle has been recorded with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians and with retroactive statements of assets over 20 million kroner.
You have to change laws.
As President, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can make legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have made use of the fact that the guide remains a free profession, and this could be carried out.
The problem is the small-scale policy - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only keeps the population.
As an independent partner, I have far greater potential to gain support from all the parties represented in this House.
My advantage is that I can take this from any party without any push-up or party IDs, which is the best for our country.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics rather on the right or on the left?
From a Czech point of view, people seem to see me on the left.
For me, however, this right-wing thinking is totally irrelevant.
It's important to me that we move on.
I don't care if someone belongs to the left or right camp; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support any good approach, even if it comes from the KSCHM or the ODS, and I will also turn to bad ideas.
You don't mind if someone calls you populists.
But don't you confirm what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And that's what you want to get close to.
You can call this populism because of me, but all the suggestions I have spoken about are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without Parliament's support, you only have words.
And so you will not get far in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you only talk to people for a long time, you will succeed, for example, in carrying out the material and criminal liability?
I don't have another chance.
Politicians, journalists and the public to convince and try to bring them to our side in order to achieve these goals.
As President, it would not be a problem for me to call on the Presidents of the parties live on television to legally secure the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And those who were charged with it should say, "Why do they deny this?"
A strong personality that highlights faults can exert pressure on the political scene.
Only take the direct election of the President, who was a merit of public pressure.
I say clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I just started with politics and tried to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn't work out, then I'm going back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a bit like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a rescuer.
I know that I alone do not achieve anything; that is why I have spoken to several well-known individuals about whether they do not want to run for the Senate.
For example, I spoke to Radim Jancura, who, however, refused to work because of overtime.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who discovered the fraud in the light oil trade.
My candidacy began with the assumption that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am not sure anymore.
Sixty percent of the electors have not gone to the elections at all, and those who have gone have chosen mostly representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independent.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will only be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, for example for the direct election of mayors and district leaders.
Do you think about the establishment of a separate party?
I have not thought about it yet, because I have no time to review the past of any potential party member, nor have I the money for it.
I don't have any money for the President's campaign yet; only 20,000 CZK are on my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about statements of assets, how do you look?
My private assets are estimated at CZK 60 million.
In Prague, I have a property worth 25 million, an apartment worth about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million, and a Shkodu Superb worth about a million, and then I have a few million in the account.
By the way, Aston Martin was a childhood dream - James Bond always loved me as he drove in the car, was gallant to women and at the same time fought against the evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have 60 million assets and you don't have any money for your campaign?
They say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to invest in your own money.
That's not exactly convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I blame you?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program may not be of much interest.
And I'm not obliged to fight the campaign on my own.
The costs for the campaign are essentially covered by my salary as a senator.
But I couldn't live on my own from the senator's content; for example, I couldn't finance my son's English school, which costs 30,000 per month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't be running for anything.
So you're still working as an entrepreneur to get your results?
Didn't you say that you're going to go back to these activities?
But this does not relate to the amount of the salary.
As promised, I have partially returned my activities.
For example, my deputy in the spring becomes the manager of the travel agency.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live with something, too.
What month income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that's still the case.
However, as President, I would like to set up my own businesses entirely.
You will find the full discussion in the Saturday issue of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in the head - for example of spikes and the most recently built Bücherberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there's something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby wholesale business, says, "But, it's beautiful already, the house."
But I wonder why we still need a bookstore today.
Everyone has Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one goes voluntarily today into one of these old-style libraries, right?
Spijkeni, a hardly necessary sleeping town in front of the Rotterdam Gate, is a unique record holder.
The 80,000 population is the lowest education rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this stupid situation, it was decided to contribute to general education a few years ago and to build up the seven fictitious bridges on the euro coins as well-designed steel concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers recognized that there was only one way to become the Statistics Lord: a library had to be here!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam Architectural Office MVRDV, master of the great bar graphs and producer of funny, yes often cynical buildings, took the matter with customary readiness and appeared to the competition-hairing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin in his face.
And while the jury was still embarrassed to look around and totter with the axes, the Frequent Maas piled up his read-up with the size of a pyramid and ended his actionist underwalled speech with the words: "Dear City Communities!"
So this is my proposal for the Bücherberg von Spijkennies, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro precious mountain is blown up.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes deep garage, supermarket, post and a few adjacent residential and row homes with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is the sightless small town hall, which until now had no more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and an unfathomable edifice, whose white facade would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory in order to enrich a piece of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkeni now has the first public cultural building in the history of his existence.
The Long Path to the Book
The first impression: Büchereldorado under cheese bells.
There is an elevator that leads through the mountain massif, but the true joys of space and reading come from the walking climb of the topography.
The indoor area is bright and clear, the burnt clinker floor and the elegant street laters speak the language of a public city.
The urban environment is perfect.
You're already looking at parkbank, dog and football boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"The book rules are usually along the facade, and in the middle lies a large, dark space, which is mostly unfriendly and unpersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have put the classic room configuration on our head and the reading area from inside to outside.
The interior of the Bücherberg is well used: in the center are offices, Internet libraries, chess clubs, environmental centres and house technology centres.
A special joy are the black book rules, which are sometimes wall coverings, sometimes brushing, sometimes climbing lands.
Optics, haptics and smell are strange.
Even embedded architects and construction engineers shake the head of the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work here with recycling materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the City Council of Spijkennies, at the request of the standard.
And so, in a Frisian farm one day, we were hit by an appropriate waste product from agriculture.
For many years in the Netherlands, a millimeter of plastic is used in growing houses and in fields as a root substrate.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile holds, two seasons, then it is ripe for the impermeable.
For the library, the flesh - for the first time in these quantities - was pressed to four centimeters thick plates.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) is dyed into a dark, homogeneous, load-able material that smells like new cars and smells like sports shoes.
After 105 steps you will be reached at the summit.
At the end of the almost 500-metre walk, you will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquets and carved fig trees.
They provide atmosphere, but especially for the right humidity in the literary mountains.
Donations for the New Soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but this house, despite the many glass surfaces, is a showcase project in pointo ecology," says Trouborst.
Heat and refrigerated with earth's heat.
Although the Bücherberg is under a glass bulge, the sun itself seems to be only short inside on sunny days.
The broad wooden beams that cross the glass facade serve as a treasure and capture a large part of the sun's rays.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest do full automatic rollos.
Stefan Spermon, the first skeptic from the IT industry, was already on the way to the new bookstore.
Letsette Verhaig was there, too.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls the Boekenberg as the "long-oversweet soul".
The reason: To open up a few weeks ago, each resident was invited to give a book from his personal stock.
This is the first time that the optical gaps in the uncompleted library - currently 70,000 pieces - are to be filled.
The concept has gone up.
The regals are filled up to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a half-year-old library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, everyone now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And when it is only the earth.
MVRDV thus succeeded in the royal discipline that is called the Identity Foundation in the Fachjargon.
Spices have written literary history.
As young and uneducated as she may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "German must play a greater role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the adoption of the vote by Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on European relations, Berlin is thus balancing at a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had first signaled that it would vote against the request for an observer status of the Palestinians with the United Nations.
But then Berlin fell apart.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now Germany must be careful, however, because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I think it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - but not to be too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from the vote when it came to establishing a flight ban zone.
This was finally implemented by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to make a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is just changing its foreign policy, away from a policy run by the United States, to a German foreign policy.
It is regrettable that Europeans do not have coherent and uniform policies.
So the Germans are between the fronts.
They are expected to play an independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still trying to play their part, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy such as France or the United Kingdom.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean, specifically from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to refer to positions that are independent of those of the US or European partners in national interests.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and its relations to certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany are to a certain degree different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position in the neighbourhood conflict and the vote in the UN?
For one thing, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be careful not to confront the public, but also the elite, in the Arab countries.
This certainly plays a role.
But I would also not want to weight too much, that is not a completely unilateral relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German discussions.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining in important decisions of the vote, for example in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great understanding of the German position.
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break, as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even respect itself.
Because it signals that it is taken seriously as an international player and its interests must be considered.
There are various opinions on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
On the other hand, the United States has clearly spoken for a veto.
Are there any differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
Because of American internal policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama has a considerable understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, represent this position.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not as big as they always appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so brightly excited by Netanyahu's politics.
Is it difficult for Germany to agree its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the EU's most important partners on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not the case at the moment.
So they can't be part of a wider line and instead they have to push things out of their own position.
They're doing that with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in pushing Europe into a European position.
This, of course, is not easy for Germany, because of its relationship with Israel.
That has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that the Germans clearly need to play an independent role.
Does Germany itself see itself as an important international player - does Germany want to take on a major role at all?
Or does Germany still have a difficult role to play?
Germany is not used to it, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a larger role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany takes a bigger role, various anti-German feelings will be free.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
That's actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by enemy countries.
Germany is seen in a much more difficult position than the USA.
It must be receptive to different neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now the U.S. influence in European policy is constantly decreasing, but the EU is not filling this vacuum right now, who else is there?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even though they don't like it, it's unpleasant for them, and it makes them a lot more unloved - c'est la vii!

"Market Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is also a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
After that, a fully officially registered name is hidden in China, but it has nothing to do with the companies of origin.
Yet she enjoys protection as long as the actual nominees do not complain.
And even then it is not clear if they get the right thing.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at the Taylor Wessing Office, who specializes in protection rights violations in Fernost.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
The followers already have a few additional letters so that they can sign up for their brands.
So from Gucci, Lu-Gucci will be easy to enter, instead of Prada, Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sports products manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with trademark entries in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company there protected the brand Zigna DF Puma, an art name that also served at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zigna.
It is known that the Chinese world champions are in copying and in the injured spiritual property.
In the large cities there are several storeys that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
But Pattloch's cases are different: On behalf of his clients, however, he insists that Chinese companies are given the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai", a driver's brand.
The word refers to "Bang Dakuan".
That's what women are meant to be fishing for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"It's business-damaging, you have to fight it," Pattloch asks.
"The brand is watered, the setting disappears, the image damage is huge."
The financial losses and the process costs of the industries concerned go to millions, especially in the case of expensive forecasting products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury goods with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year and the fastest growing.
However, deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to reach and go to the money.
Up to nine years, the procedure can be extended, with uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports on cases in which the Court of First Instance rejected the appeal because, after the long term of the contested name, it had become a "marktreality".
If the plaintiff had Pech, he had to pay the plagiarism even because he had damaged his brand in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes the law of the jungle reigns here.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction engineer manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump builder Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese may still use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo Buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo that reminded BMW; the dispute was slammed, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against followers from Hong Kong and Singapore who made the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The brand name CTMO in Beijing, however, admits that there were too few staff and space equipment in 2010 there.
In the past year, however, one was returned to normal from the "notation situation in the work cycle".
Thus, the stock of unprocessed opposition proceedings decreased by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 objections to execution are still pending in the office.
To approach it costs a lot
How often in China the numbers are impressive.
Last year more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection were submitted to the CTMO, almost a third more than 2010.
This is a record and means that China will conduct the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth time, the Authority will communicate.
This also applies to the existence of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan received fees.
Simply stated, each application in the average costs 1280 Yuan or 160 euros.
On the other hand, a multiple costs, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting a Chinese plagiarism.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that their illicit manufacture of simulated parts of vehicles was lifted.
However, the successor continued to secure Chinese rights at the Freudenberg brand.
You have failed this yourself, as family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wenzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trademark CTMO also rejected the claim of the Munichers.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg was right, but the opposition continues to fight.
You need to be careful.
Now the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and commends the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be identified, the company archive has even had to review hundreds of years of old files in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposite side a "high six-point euro" for settlement.
"That's how much it's worth to us," Wenzler says.
The dangers in Fernost threaten even to flee back to Europe.
That's when copyists secure unprotected brands there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to sign up the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business field has been abandoned by the group for a long time, yet it was able to withdraw the registration.
"You have to be careful," says Wenzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advised German companies to be very careful in dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights; rather, the foreigners should "all that is somehow protective, even in China," says Wenzler.
Otherwise, it can become much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg is subject to the last act of his brand drama, then you probably have to pay the other side license fees for your own name, says Wenzler.
Or we will be forced out of the market in the question segment.
World Day: Stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Chor Imbongi - and in Swaziland, AIDSwaisen are happy about it.
The history of a connection that exceeds far more than 8733 kilometers.
First there is the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies' pumps and men's slippers, looking for the pace on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
First, the voices of the singers slowly slow down - old, bass, tenor and soprano - torpedoes, torpedoes and chase themselves.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost takes it out of his fabric shoes when he brings them together with his filthy wild gestures.
It's Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Chor Imbongi is trying a new song.
Fifty singers and singers, between 23 and 69 years of age, have arrived from the human geneticist to the house man.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choir has a different text and this is also in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Aid for self-help
Worldwide, there are about 34 million HIV infected, which estimates Unaids, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS.
23.5 million people live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland, 245,000 AIDS addicts live.
More than 40 percent of the population are currently HIV positive.
For 180 AIDSwaisen in the village of Esitni, the Association of Voices for Africa Paten has found in Germany.
70 of them attend a further school.
For 15 or 20 Euros per month you can take a patent.
It guarantees the child school money, school form and a hot meal every day in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means Zulu historians or also lobbyists.
The Bantu language can speak fluently, no one can speak in this room, but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and brings them back and forth to where they originally came from: in South Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometres from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitni, which depends on the voice force of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, most of which are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents anymore because they are infected with the HI virus.
In Esiteni, there is evidence of a small disease in Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to UNICEF.
Cuts in the male front, which reduce the risk of inflammation by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than 40 percent of the people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus in themselves, dying in the middle of 30 is not rare.
On a joint African trip in the spring of 2005, the Chor discovered the village, but especially the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, not only lacking parental care, but simply all: food, clothing, education.
You don't have a chance in a poor country.
At first, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and allow him a warm meal a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which has been working almost professionally on AIDS in Esiteni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (Gonorrhö).
Common viral STIs are HIV, Human Papilomavir, Herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Filament and creases are part of the parasitic STI.
Who are the main groups concerned?
Symphilis and tripper are especially common in men who have sex with men.
The Robert-Koch Institute suggests that at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contacts between men.
In heterosexual adults Chlamydia infections, trichomonadins, candidiasis (Pilz), tripper and human papillomavir are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The prevalence of HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults in this country - however: around 20 percent of new HIV infections fall within this group.
Chlamydia infections are significantly more common among adolescents than in other population groups.
After European surveys, three quarters of all infections concern young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In addition, human papillomavir is common in adolescents.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reported.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute of Diseases, the number of syphilis infections increased from 1697 in 2001 to 3698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has decreased since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2700 cases.
This is about a tenth less than the previous year.
What symptoms suggest a gender disorder?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, urinary complaints, diarrhoea, abdominal pain as well as blisters or herbs.
Often, however, they do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of inflammation, but do not offer a hundred percent protection.
Because, in part, causes of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through fungal infections and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular studies, especially in frequently changing sex partners.
Earlyly diagnosed, most STIs can be cured and delayed.
Through patents, donations, and not least the gags that the chorus escapes throughout Germany, some come together.
"In total, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esiteni," says Annette Lennartz, the president of the association.
In the village Zodwa Dlamini, a self-aware and enforcement woman, manages the money from Germany.
She also takes care of the well-being of the cows, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as you call the old women Zulu, are the support of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 eggs, give them a roof over their head and ensure that the children in their uniforms appear on time every day for school instruction.
Those who no longer have anyone come to the home of Khanysile, a single woman who is paid by the association as well as the two kitchens who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has launched a nursing school, built two chicken houses, and organized, together with the American health organization PSI, that many in the village have made a HIV test.
This is not self-evident, for as obviously the disease is throughout the country, it is kept silent by the death of the loved one.
A King With 14 Wives
"Aids is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
In fact, it is rare in a country where the king is officially married to 14 women.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Let's think about it instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-approved form of life that the HI virus has spread so rapidly over the past decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus across the country.
There are free condoms at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
Culture is another - flash to flash."
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi-Chor travels all two or three years together through South Africa and sings songs full of rage, spirit of struggle, confidence and black self-consciousness, which many know at the southern tip of the black continent from the times of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has already shed some tears on some cruel border soldiers.
The trip always leads to Esitni, where the singers visit their patent children.
Even if you hardly find the small village on land maps, it is more known in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
"Go to Esitni, there's the light" people say there.
And if you go back to Heidelberg, the 8733 kilometres of the air line, to the singing singers in the sample room on the Bergheimer Straße, then you can see there too.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on planet Mercury.
The ice cover may be up to 20 meters thick.
The US Space Authority NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on planet Mercury.
Although he is the next sun, there are also frozen water there, as published in the journal "Science" from three on Thursday.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the shadowed region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly also asteroids that are stuck on mercury.
No one is bringing the founding of ice, but with the existence of life on the planet, the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon, said.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to explain how water and other building blocks of life have been achieved in other areas of the solar system.
Notable by earth’s citizens are probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix to explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send pictures to Earth: Small holes in infinite distances.
The picture comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the Zwargplanet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which surrounds Neptune around the sun, Ceres is not a "planet" after the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This aspect of an infrared recording of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are to be recognized as blue points, to be more difficult to identify are the pink "newborn" in the star circle.
This star-forming region - called unromantic W5 by scientists - has discovered the telescope Spitzer in the constellation Cassiopeia, in a distance of 6500 light years.
This shimmering gluten of a dying star has captured the peak telescope of the NASA.
The Donut-shaped ring consists of material that the star exposed to in the process of death.
In the huge trifid fog, 5400 light years away from the earth, new stars are created from gas and dust.
The peak telescope of NASA shot this photo of the galactic pole of birth.
The Plejaden Star Team, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen with the naked eye at night.
With the telescope, however, the colors are better applied.
Like a red age, the Helix fog looks at this infrared photo against the viewer.
It is located 700 light years away in the Aquarius constellation.
His similarity to an earthly continent brought this fog to the title North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photos ensures spectacular coloring.
This baby star could only be recorded in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: As these were created, it is one of the great puzzles of astronomy.
Perhaps they are the remnants of a Saturn moon, which disappeared smoothly 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the biggest and strongest recordings of the Hubble telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxy
According to coloring, recordings of spiral galaxies will be true works of art.
The recording published by the European Southern Guard shows the thousands of light-years of trifid nebula in the constellation shield.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (trilaterally divided, divided), as dark dust strips triple the glowing heart of the star birthplace.
Astronomers have photographed the predictions of a cosmic carambolage: 400 million light-years away from the earth, the core of two melting galaxies race together and are bound together inevitably.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
If there are no technical abbreviations, it may be called the Southern Wheel at its peak name.
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows an excerpt from the Irisnebel in the constellation Kepheus.
The 1400 light-year fog consists of dust grains, which are ten to a hundred times smaller than usual household dust.
This image was composed of optical and X-ray recordings of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from the earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, picked up the space telescope Hubble for the NASA.
The largest spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
There is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The star scale always produces new youngsters.
Also, this star cloud, connected with the Rosetten fog, is constantly bringing forth new baby stars - 5000 light years away from the earth.
In this light-emitting galaxy with a small black hole, there is still no dust, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that he was only born shortly after the outbreak when he was found major hydrogen in the universe.
Our insights into all: The most important telescopes
The telescope was supposed to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - before Galileo Galileo used it for star observation a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have been increasing - and the insights they provide are getting deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the world's largest remote tube.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Large Binocular Telescope is located.
It lets glance into everything just over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior life of the Gran Telescopio Canaria on the Canary Islands of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone is 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of South African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the cheap way of building: The telescope is fixed in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed in the height angle.
Its particularity: the high luminous intensity.
This is enough - despite relatively small mirror diameter - to the largest mirror telescope in the world.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers hear everything after extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
For the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), each computer owner can help by providing computing power.
Look at the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Andes of Chile.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which makes all the honours in his name.
With a total of four mirrors, the remote tube can also illuminate the central infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is to cover 42 meters - and it is composed of almost 1000 mirrors.
However, it is possible to calculate with images by 2018 at the earliest.
By 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors with an average of ten meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which overlooks them with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF in the sky.
Also on the Mauna Kea, a new, huge telescope - with a mirror average of 30 meters.
Here it's amazing on an illustration.
The most important impressions from all, however, are delivered by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990 it has already delivered pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler has been searching for extrasolar planets - mainly for those that are habitable.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that 1235 planetary candidates have been identified since the start of the mission.
In the picture, the last preparations are documented at the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched on board an Ariane5 rocket in 2018.
The primary mirror of the world's space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It should look for light from the first stars and galaxies for the urn.
Scientists assume that there is also the southern tip of Mercury Ice.
However, there are no reliable data for this, since the messenger is far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have indicated that there is ice on Mercury for decades.
The Messenger probe launched in 2004 - the first to circle around Mercury - now scientists have certainty.
Drinking butter daily - and become 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a Biblically high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A track search in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a Biblically high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A track search in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
The journey through the Talysch mountain is called wildrmantic.
The small bus rumbling over the curved road, past densely forested hills, winding rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you were in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border to Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian group of the Thai people lives, of which it is not well known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Assyrian and is very long-lived.
The final station is Lerik.
The small town continues with too much built architecture from Soviet times, which does not even want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too difficult is the approach of Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometers it takes eight hours because the road is only one-way.
The tangible wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the proof of the tourist attraction.
"Baku was famous for the Eurovision Song Festival in May - and next year we have a festival here of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here the Vita is documented by about eight dozen Thais from the area, who are older than 100. Fatulayeva shows a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, a child was born
However, the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who should have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented person who became 122 years old, Muslümov's age seems to be extremely doubtful.
"In 1805 he was born here in the region, died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136, to have witnessed another daughter.
So did Şirali Muslümov count for a few decades at his age?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, a senior researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has been one of the high school students in Central Asia.
"Above many high-ranking people there are also in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia there are very many very old men".
However, due to the lack of documents, there is no scientific evidence of age, especially the lack of a personal register.
Butter definitely melted every day
However, the fact is that the people of the region around Lerik often reach a Biblical age.
Currently there are 20 people who are over 100 years of age.
So why are there so many highlanders here in the south?
The Asian travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Thais.
On the other hand, museum director Fatulayeva believes that it is on the diet.
However, that calculated the calorie-rich cost of the Thais should be so healthy that they love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of which drink a bottle of melted butter daily, from a nutritional point of view, does not appear to be quite plausible.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical of the whole Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a bottle cap, which she uncomfortably rolls back and forth.
Eight people live here under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both are grandparents for a long time.
Two little kids also jump around.
In the kitchen you will prepare the guests tea which is served in the typical, belly-shaped Armadou glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly in line and joint, beneath her head she hides long, dark-blond paws, which her son proudly reveals before us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so they never left me and kept their color.
"I never used Shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to live
She has always only eaten what came from her own court, tomatoes, potatoes, herbaceous.
For the rest of my life, I didn't buy food once in the supermarket.
Then she tells of her husband who was in the army.
The worst was in the times after World War II.
But everything got better than the "loved father" Heydar Aliyew took over the rudder.
The propaganda rarely sounds out of the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult that is driven around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country as a dictator, hardly knows the borders in Azerbaijan.
By 2003 he was in power, later took over his son Ilham the ruder.
At the same time, there is no need under Azerbaijan's old age.
230 Manat (e.g. the same sum in euro) receives Mirzayeva monthly as a pension, for these conditions an amount from which you can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-motivated son is right: "The old enjoy our culture's high regard."
They live in the midst of the big family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that's not a reason, stay alive as long as possible
The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Competitive broadcasts in Cairo revealed the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with the Sharia as the basis is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not save himself with Pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds lies in my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said in state television.
His speech was directed to the entire people, but especially to the Christian Coptics, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secularists.
Because they are all afraid, so far, of breaking up hopelessly into a confused opposition.
Fear a state of God at the river of grace of the mighty Muslim brotherhood.
He has, said Mohammed Mursi, almost apologizing, temporarily cut down the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his powers to "save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate at the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, about which the Egyptians are themselves, the world is not quite clear.
Whether the judges should be removed
In fact, the 234 articles, which were spent in a nightly, 15-hour parforcerit, were partly concerned by the Islamist-dominated 100-head constitutional assembly.
As in previous constitutions, it is also said in the draft that the case law is based on the "Principles of Islamic Law".
But what does "principles" mean?
That was and is an interpretation and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the vague formulation and the resulting legal space for a more strict interpretation of the Sharia.
This includes at least one new article to be added: In all the matters related to Sharia, the Al-Ashar University had to be pulled aside, the country's most important Islamic institution with great radiation in all Sunni Islam.
This does not have to be done, but it can mean that spirituality supervises the legislation, which in fact would result in the acquittal of the judgment.
Much in the draft Constitution is an interpretation matter
Also problematic: Civil Military Jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak's rule to suppress opposition.
After the defeat of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians sat in military.
The State should also, as it is in the draft, "the true being of the Egyptian family" protect "and promote their morals and values".
This is so juridically formulated that state institutions with the help of this article could even control the content of film art and literature.
In the text, this means nothing but censorship.
No article specifically defines equality between men and women.
For this, another prohibits the Prophet Mohammed and his apostles from politicizing or slandering.
But what is a disgrace and how it is to be punished remains unclear.
Likewise, dubios advocates the formulation that has been forbidden "injury of people".
Is there a cartoon of the president or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
An explanation of how much is in the draft which Mursi presented for signature and, according to his words, "very soon" the Egyptians will be presented for the referendum.
"The Revolution is back"
The opposition has formed itself for weeks against the overpowering of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual entry on the Friday evening at Tahrir Square in Cairo and promised to drop the charter before it could enter into force.
"The revolution is back and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placer of the presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Authority Mohamed El-Baradei stated that the draft Constitution belongs to "the Müllberg of History".
Through short notice service Twitter, he visited the trailer Mursis, who wanted to run a "putch against democracy".
"If he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and crush him," said the opposition Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet healthy," the Egyptian media quoted opposition politicians Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Qur'an is our constitution."
The well-organised Muslim Brotherhood, on the other hand, remained on the show, but not on Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other nilufer before Cairo University.
Many veiled women and followers of the Salafists took part and cried out: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They called out to Mursi, “Pure the land!” And they said, “The Qur’an is our constitution.”
A struggle over the height of the symbolic Tahrir Square, on which everything took place at the beginning, would probably have been in a state of civil war.
The Mursis trailer obviously didn't want to risk it.
The Muslim brothers explained that both the opponents of the draft Constitution and the supporters had spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the poll which direction the country should go.
A majority for the draft of Islamists is considered safe.
"The word of human rights does not even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this forced constitutional process, which would have actually gone until February and involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were in prison under Mubarak or in court.
Not because he would share their view of the world, but because human rights are inseparable to him.
He was sentenced, sentenced, imprisoned for this.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new Constitution," he complained in the discussion with the "World on Sunday".
Mursi's extension of power to all three forces in the state allowed the lawyer to resign.
These measures are flagrant violations of democratic rules of play and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto excluded her from power," lamented Saeda.
But without civil society organisations, democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels alone, also from the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle at the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be true.
A protestant on Tahrir warns: "You give a monster that you can no longer control."
Rakfish from Norway: is this the most cumbersome fish in the world?
The five million Norwegians enjoy one of the highest standards of living - not just in Europe, but throughout the world.
Could the country's secret of success have something to do with the local appetite on rather annoying fish?
You take a selection of overripe cheese varieties.
They are placed in the midst of a pile of dirty, damp sportswear.
And spend a week there.
So close you have to imagine the nosy smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway's great delicacy.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There are snow, spectacular landscapes - and this harsh smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is salt-flavoured forelle, which is fermented in water for up to one year, depending on how stinking you would have liked to have your fish.
When the darkness comes over the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norwegians stream to a party here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, well, really very interesting speciality.
"You eat it raw and then wash it down with a glass of Aquavit," says Harvard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire department, but as so-called "Rakfisk General" also held the festival.
Around us people consume small fish worms and take great amounts of alcohol.
"People like the aquarium more than the Rakfish," says Havard.
The spirit can suppress the smell.
I'll take a few hippies.
If you avoid bringing the fish near your nose, it's not bad - like Sushi, who has a pretty long bus ride behind him.
Rakfisk is the product of a much different, much poorer Norwegian epoch, than there were no cooling options yet and fish were drunk in the fall in dense saltwater ponds.
In the deepest winter it was then removed after long fermentation and - no doubt with the help of alcohol - consumed senses.
Even before a generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country, mainly moving to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, angeled by a flourishing labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was not far richer than Norway long ago, streamed immigrants.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, but also strictly richer part of Norwegian history.
It belongs to the more expensive courts you can buy here.
But actually everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs you 10 euros.
Norway doesn't often get into the world press, and most people don't seem to mind that.
Here you still hate to call Anders Breivik by name - those racist rights extremists who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, it refers only to the "event of 22 July".
Norway is hard to accept that someone in its peaceful country is capable of such brutal killings.
The main responsibility for Norway's present wealth has been the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why we're doing so well," says Anna, our waiter, who distributes round tablets with mature raccoon and with her long blonde hair and the striking blue eyes the Nordic ideal is incorporated.
We are a -- as you say -- prudent people.
Your English is just like most people here are homeless.
We're not very polite, we don't like gossip.
Norway has been very cautious about its oil wealth - a large part of the industry's income is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
As in the years leading up to the global economic crisis, everyone threw money around which they did not even own, Norway kept its stock exchange firmly closed.
"If we can walk in the winter ski and walk in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And of course, Rakfish," she adds with uncomplicated laughter.
I am standing in the snow and standing before another court - from Rakfisk I have enough.
Such an elk-citizen is certainly something else.
But in the evening the steak fish is back on the food plan.
The hotel where I stay is one of several venues that organize a Rakfisk dinner, with guests for the best - or perhaps the most challenging sense of smell - fish.
There is a live TV switch to a flying showmaster surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The show resembles the Eurovision Song Contest.
"How many points do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You laugh and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps overwhelmed by the Aquavit.
But maybe it's the strict bottom of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start
While Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares for his office, Will Grant analyzes the challenges he faces and the mixed feelings of his people.
Current traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even on better days this is a permanently closed city, but on Monday a steel ring was built, which blocks several important traffic routes into the capital and ensures chaos on the streets.
However, the aim was not to interfere with pendants on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the Presidential Bond and take over the nation's leadership.
He's facing a complex task.
Under the separate government, Felipe Calderons has been able to make economic success in Mexico, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
"My government is strongly committed to reducing violence," Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama early this week at the Oval Office.
I will propose a new security strategy to enable us to achieve this objective.
Before he joined the U.S. president on high, Pena Nieto was the governor of his home country of Mexico.
In this densely populated large part of the country surrounding the capital, the views on the new head of state are shared.
A direct man
For example, in the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, you would like to remember him.
The residents of the holiday resort are responsible for the development of tourism and the construction of the infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto had built and which represent a great improvement to the broken, helpful roads that once existed here.
Plates with its name also hang outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum for climate change.
"We expect him to make real and lasting changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as Congressman for the Pena Nietos Party.
In particular, with regard to security and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs so urgently.
After 81 years of power, the PRI was dissolved in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Los Pinos presidential palace, the party has made great expectations for Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the opposition, which the new president lacks in substance.
He was a very direct man, very committed and had great plans for the country.
He is an excellent citizen, but above all, he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other hand, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the plastered streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under highway transfers and is in many ways a city of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of a crucial urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was activated to combat the drug gangs operating in the districts, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a spot in Brachland near a large garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left alone in the last two years.
During Governor Pena Nieto's term of office, over 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistics that even exceed that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is accused of their violence and murder to innocent women.
Critics Pena Nietos believe that he has at least not dealt with the problem of the murder of women during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government has closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the lower quarter, Irinea Buendia fights the tears when she shows me pictures of her dead daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana started suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her companion.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body star had already been used.
While her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is added to a cross that bears one single word: justice.
But that's exactly what the family said, you've rejected her so far.
The authorities treated me like I was a schizophrenic, a troublemaker, a naggerin.
They want you to just accept your judgment and keep your mouth shut.
"But that's not possible if there were so many form errors and mistakes," she says.
If President Pena Nieto receives the President's bond on Saturday, he will also assume a great responsibility.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of Mexican families have been brought into compassion by violent crimes, and the new president has promised to take special care of this problem during his term of office.
"I hope as President he is the way he was governor," says PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But just before that, the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid.
The Public Prosecutor's Office claims: Bradley Manning has not complained about abuse
The prosecutor objected to Bradley Manning's allegations that he had been abused in prison
The hearing deals with Mannings time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defence seeks a rejection of the charge on the grounds of strict conditions of detention
The release of the U.S. Army is proposed to have removed thousands of confidential documents
On Friday, the public prosecutor tried to find that the army-free Bradley Manning - accused of the greatest disclosure of confidential information in US history - failed several occasions to complain about the alleged abuse in the military.
During a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland explained to Maj. Ashden Fine that documents on weekly visits by prison officials during Manning's nine-month imprisonment in Quantico, Virginia had no complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross trial, which was held as a result of an application for defence for the rejection of the charge - Manning had already been punished enough by the hard time in prison - Manning had said he would have considered suicide in prison.
The US Army's secret service analyst, arrested in June 2010, is proposed to have stolen thousands of confidential documents during his period of service in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fein and Manning went through the forms, which the officials had completed after meeting with Manning during his imprisonment in Quantico Military Prison, where he had been under increased prison conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When fine asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had considered the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the institution as a whole as "very professional".
The forms, so fine, did not include complaints of abuse, although the officials had asked Manning directly for his treatment.
Manning replied that he had voiced his concerns and the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they should deal with them.
"They wrote (after discussion of the concerns) "No problems", and that didn't necessarily mean that I didn't say anything at all," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met a committee in January 2011 that should examine the Swiss thoughts mentioned earlier by him on a form.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to lower his status of observation to "prevention of injuries".
The military told him that it had assigned this restrictive status - which is a stage under the threat of suicide - to his and to the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that it was good for me, and to get rid of the status of observation for the prevention of injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning said on Thursday that he was arrested and transferred to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before he was transferred to the Marinebase Quantico prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said in Kuwait he considered suicide and was once unconscious because of the heat.
Not knowing what happened to him or in the outside world was a burden.
"My world collapsed on Camp Arafjon, on this cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in this cage.
When moved to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
He was allowed only one mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay in motion because on the day it was forbidden to sleep or just to sleep.
He always had to sleep with light, which penetrated from the outside into his cell.
When he turned around at night and could no longer see his face, he was awakened to return.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally objected to Manning's treatment.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, military prison in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned a charge he had raised in his statement on Thursday - so he slept naked in his cell in Quantico and had to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners in a morning count.
Manning had said he had never had the opportunity to hide with his cover during this count.
On Friday's interview, Manning reported that he had concluded from an order of his guard that he should have the roof with which he could have covered. However, he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning said that he had been forced to sleep naked last night. He had previously tried to show an officer that he did not pose any danger to himself.
Manning told the officer that he could have used the alliance of his underwear or flip-flops to hurt himself, but he didn't.
Tonight, as Manning said, his underwear, flip-flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his prison experience and that his sentence will be substantially reduced, he should be convicted in his trial before the military court.
The defence has indicated that Manning will be guilty of minor offences while other prosecutions, which are considered to be too extreme, are to be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend, and a justification of the conditions of detention is expected from the Public Prosecutor.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning has been determined in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners kept under the highest security measures in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the support of the enemy, the illegal publication of confidential information on the Internet, the transmission of national defence information and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty at all counts, he is threatened with a life sentence.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people have been forced to leave Mexico due to their lack of opportunity
Mexicans tend to accuse immigrants - they call them to mind difficult times, he says.
Navarrette is the view that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the pass when advicelessness was taking root in me.
Paints refer to two wait hoses: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "External" ("foreigners").
I've been there for a few seconds, I'm not sure which one I should go to.
I grew up in central California and was called a Mexican all my life.
An ethnic shortcut - just like my friends in Boston called themselves "Iren" or my friends in New York called "Italian".
Later, I decided to "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home there was no need for shorts or tapes.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to claim in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a mother-speaker, and I won't get my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the line for Foreigners.
I was thinking about that moment this week when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
The agenda included all the topics that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. She is one reason why Mexicans today remain as likely in Mexico as they are to emigrate to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a North American trading block as an example of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue the war in Mexico against drug cartels, even though he did not mention details in this regard.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans are probably never wasting a single thought that in 1848 the United States entered Mexico and forced the leadership of the country under a reserved weapon to leave them more than half of its territory.
But for Mexicans who think for centuries and not for minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
So as soon as a U.S. government official even takes the mildest criticism of Mexico, it is heard, in the Mexican press and under the elites of the country, complaints about how Americans undermine the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezumas are on the war path.
And yet Mexico's biggest challenge is in fact in relation to the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Would you like to talk about feelings?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree, a person - perhaps a parent or a parent - did not get a chance in Mexico and migrated north.
And in most cases this person corresponds to a profile - dark, uneducated, poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our trust is with them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now live the American dream, attend good schools and get good jobs, we should never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes be faded, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This is clearly true of the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many of us do not like the Mexican leadership.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a faggot of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our band in Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we would not be caught behind the sidewalk now - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take this evil for them.
While she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know have the feeling that they don't belong to one country or another.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springstone.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but none of them are rooted in it.
In Mexico we'll be seen as Americans.
And in the United States we'll be seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my journey, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the education citizenship want to resume their links to Diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional "messenger" for Mexico, who represent their interests in the United States.
We are going to tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and exert pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties to Mexico.
Nope.
That won't happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And in view of the unfair distribution of income, the intractable corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure if it is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through it alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet willing to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico another half century ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a role to play in how their family members were not treated for so long.
Hmm.
Maybe we're Mexican when I thought.
Old fights, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected base for peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to stifle such hope in the Keim.
In the midst of the usual debt instructions, countless buildings were placed in shield and ash, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time, rockets from Gaza were struck near the Israeli metropolis Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
Although Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these wars.
Maybe this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to assume that the deadly pat situation could finally end.
A War That Will Not Be Lost or Won
At first glance, optimism seems to be all but applicable in view of the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November, this week's struggles have strengthened the hard-cores on both sides.
The leader of Hamas, the Islamic movement, which has been controlling the Gaza Strip since 2007, is claimed to have forced the Israelis back, even though his own group had to bear great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are being invaded in one of the most isolated and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to destroy Hamas so far.
In fact, Hamas also wins in the West Jordan, which is controlled by the rivaling, moderated Palestinian group Fatah.
And Hamas leaders could conclude that they have the time on their side.
As Islamists in the Arab world have gained influence, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends on their side.
Turkey, a reinvigorating regional power once considered Israel's strictest Muslim ally, has taken over the Hamas Party - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Happy Hamas supporters believe that Israel is a half-moon of Islam - from Lebanon to northern Lebanon, where the militant Hisbollah has power, over Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist attack on Bashar Assads could stand in front of the fall of Bashar Assads, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
In particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the most populous and important Arab country in the distance - has changed the regional balance in the southern flange.
Hosni Mubarak, the Laizist despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had only little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the brotherhood with Hamas is weakened and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could act as an actor who cannot be pushed out by Israel and the United States itself.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw an opposing conclusion.
Militaryly, the Hamas is no longer in danger.
The Israeli missile defence system, Iron Dome, has been able to prove itself and many of Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while Israel will be able to sleep more quietly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States is firmly committed to its position. Many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest escalations of violence.
Israel has achieved well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has ignored the peace process to a large extent.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the blockades that have entered the West Bank and thus into the main part of any Palestinian state.
Netanyahu is well there. His liquid party joined an even more combat group on 22 January under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why do these post-list Palestinians also hate and abandon their own state?
If they actually had control over the West Bank, wouldn't they also fire rockets just like their counterparts in the Gaza Strip?
No, it's better to keep them behind the wall in check and punish them, they should dare to lift their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able to implement themselves, but the Arab spring could make them a strike through the bill.
Even if the Islamists now in power in Egypt and in other countries have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel's defense set is larger than its four Arab neighbours.
A war with local superpowers will hardly help the new Arab governments to restore their economies.
The fact that Pragmatic President Mursi met with Barack Obama in order to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign - perhaps symbolizing the beginning of a new era.
Israel too should think longer.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking decisive steps towards democratisation, Palestinians are still being robbed of their own right of self-determination - a powdery constitution that will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli-occupied areas, just as a bus in Tel Aviv exploded this week.
The oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population it will only intensify this situation.
Bloody missions to repress the Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribe over the years.
Both sides need an attack from outside
The right answer is that it will be represented by the more rational representatives of the two sides, the majority of the rest of the world and by this newspaper: two states in which Israel enters for security purposes.
The hope for the near future is that the ceasefire on the outside will give more influence to the implementation of this solution.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar, must now stop the arms supply in the Gaza Strips and is better positioned than ever to convince the Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state on the basis of the borders of 1967, supplemented by territorial exchange and a common Jerusalem.
Foreign Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would be done more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama must also contribute to Israel’s opening up negotiations.
During his first term of office, he ignored the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away from the white house, it seems as if he was also reluctant to participate.
But this is a sad, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has an essential interest in a stable Middle East.
And this is part of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws for single packs of cigarettes enter into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packagings, which are the same for all tobacco brands
The first laws for uniform packs of cigarettes and tobacco have come into force in Australia. This replaces brand logos and colours by neutral, olive-green lids, which are printed with drastic images, showing sick body parts and smoking to infants and children.
Apart from the different health warnings and images, the only difference between the packages in the names printed in identical, small font is from the coming Saturday.
Australia thus introduces the most stringent rules for tobacco packaging in the world.
The Australian Federal Government wants to eliminate young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
The government of studies that have shown that people who have not started at 26 years of age will not start again with 99% probability.
"You can already see in young children that they understand the message that tobacco groups are trying to apply for their brand image," says Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek. She cites studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia is one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will only have a minor impact on the profits of multinational groups, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco club fought hard against the laws.
It was said that the law would favour the black market trade, which would lead to cheaper and easier accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintentional consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian fakes will be offered far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
On the other hand, others say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that demand for cigarettes and silicone covers has increased enormously since the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan failed two months ago at the Australian Supreme Court with their opposition to the laws.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale shops and is waiting for new stocks.
It's a good deal for us.
According to experts, the hook lies in the popularity of social media in exactly the population group to which the plan is addressed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, banning them from acting as sports sponsors and forcing most traders to stop putting cigarettes out of business. Now tobacco advertising is on the Internet.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but does not have any influence on international sites.
"He who markets tobacco and has only one small area left to apply for his products doesn't go around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, a health researcher at Sydney University.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has seen an increase in experience reports about brands written by "all normal people".
You have to ask yourself: Is this just a private person who finds so great likes Marlboro cigarettes that they even record a video for it - or has a marketing agency to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that instead of marketing, industry is focusing on getting rid of the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to tackle the new rules - those countries complain about unfair trade restrictions in the world trade organization, although none of the countries engage in more trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for mid-2013.
According to Plibersec, the government has conducted discussions with other countries that consider similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to provide photographic warnings in 2001.
Meanwhile, these have been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are being enacted in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are proud of themselves.
The pictures don't affect me.
I just ignore them.
"You just take a cup and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box, where a photo is printed with a mouth tumor.
Honestly, there's only one reason I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, the operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in the city centre of Sydney, says that the uniform packaging has made it difficult to fill his regalia.
"I used to need an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four," Yu says.
"The government should have just banned cigarettes completely - then we would have said okay, that's what we're doing," he apparently added.
In a world of constant electricity, it is nice to be tired even once
This thank you I spent an unexpected five hours at the airport when our plane crashed due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another pilot.
So I had enough time to make a few thoughts for a long time.
I don't want to lie.
A half-day waiting at the airport for a flight is rather nervous - even when books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts have long been positive.
When it comes to them, it is for us - and our children - to be occasionally bored.
This forces the brain to lose itself in interesting ways of thinking, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us today are almost constantly staring at one or another screen, the benefits of long periods of time are no longer good for us.
So should we welcome the long-lasting with open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
I'll be back.
Like many people, I have always assumed that for a long time it is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Bordom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) doesn't look like that.
"In fact, the long vacations have a very long history," he says.
The house wall of Pompeii paints a Latin graffiti over long periods of time, which dates back to the first century.
And then there's still the question of how we've actually defined for a long time.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that for a long time has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that for a long time as the experience of wanting to pursue a satisfactory activity, but unable to do so, could be defined.
For a long time apart from Apathie, it is therefore that the person is not busy, but it wants to be.
On the other hand, there is no need to do anything about apathy.
The key experience of the long-term, he says, is in a "distortion of the attention process, paired with bad pay and the feeling that time is only passing slowly".
For a long time, it can almost sound like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions might be related, tired people see the problem in their environment or in the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think that we are bored, even though we have only difficulties focusing on ourselves.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - for example, in German: "The inactive mind: The definition of long periods of time under the aspect of attention", published in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to a previous experiment, where participants heard a band on which a person wrote a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud TV program from the neighbouring room, which had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so it was hardly noticeable, while the third group did not understand this voice at all.
The people who were barely listening to television reported that they had more time to feel than the other two groups - they had problems concentrating on themselves, could not find any reason for this and attributed their difficulties to the long term.
If you try to concentrate on a difficult or demanding task, the distraction can lead to prolonged attention, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you have a consistent activity - "like the search for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help you not to feel tired".
In fact, as he says, we now know that roundabouts and screams, often interpreted as signs for long periods of time, can even fight them by keeping people physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to hang around learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored once in a while - my late flight, a drumming speaker, a particularly tiring movie.
But some people get bored easier than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers developed a "long-term coincidence scale" in the 1980s.
On the scale are statements like "Many things I have to do, repeat and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
With the help of such scales, researchers have found that boys often become bored as girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - especially as regards the need for more and a greater variety of external travel.
But in general, teenagers are a rather relaxed herd.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32% of the female adults in school and when carrying out household chores were tired, whereas 23% indicated that they were bored if they were not in school.
However, only 3% of the parents indicated that they felt tired.
Professor Larson today, 21 years later, says he doesn't know if the percentages have increased or decreased for long periods.
However, he was sure that "the young people will feel particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers have no major influence on their daily life.
So go back to my original question: Is long time healthy?
Sometimes not, because in the extreme case it leads people to take extreme physical risks and fall into gambling or drugs to alleviate them - studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between long-term and creativeness. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the subject for more than two decades.
"In the long run, the brain wants to say something else to do," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do exactly what to do.
If you are bored and you use this energy to play and cook guitars, you will be happy.
But while television can provide for happiness in the short term, it can make people feel happy again in the long term.
So whoever is pregnant with his child will have an iPad that can take away from it for a long time. However, it has not learned to entertain or control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "self-control transfers from one situation to another".
The child learns not only to be entertained but also to gain more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate for a long time.
We should not see them too critical.
Instead, our aim should be to make us feel well beyond the constant activity and technology resolution.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we often have to be bored. But for a long time it is a painful, unrelenting desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people in truth are only looking for a way to turn off and relax.
"In an environment where we are constantly being overstimulated, it is difficult to deal with when the noise is once confused."
In Colorado there is no clear guidelines for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old Community College student and football player Anthony Orozco stands in southeastern Colorado for an offence that will soon be legal in this state: the possession of some less marijuana cracks and a pipe with which he smoked.
According to Orozco, he and some friends on a September day with the car in Lamar near the border to Kansas were on their way when they were stopped.
After finding Marijuana police officers in the car, Orozco was presented for possession of drugs and drug addictions - Cavalier delicacy, each with a fine of 100 US dollars - and received a court term.
"We're treated like criminals," says Orozco.
But he's also one?
In the uncertain weeks following the state's decision to legalise small quantities of marijuana for its own use, the answer to hundreds of smaller drugs depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of irregularities affecting Marijuana will already be committed here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities no longer prosecute adults over 21 years of age for possession to a small extent. This is permitted by law as soon as the new laws enter into force in the coming weeks.
But state prosecutors in the more conservative parts of Colorado have announced that there are existing marijuana delicacies to continue and still quote people in court.
At the same time, several cities agree to prevent new state-licensed marijuana businesses from opening up in their municipalities from the cities of Denver to the Western Mountains.
"This situation is developing so quickly that I don't even know what's going to happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
And also regulatory authorities in the state of Washington are running out of their heads.
They await guidance to establish a licensing system for the production, manufacture, sale and sale of drugs - and have a deadline until 1 December 2013.
In Washington it is believed that Colorado is in any case a prerequisite for most states with regard to the regulation of Marijuana. There, drugs were only legalized for medical purposes and then for their own consumption.
"Coloro has a more regulated market. Therefore, the state is well suited to orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesperson of the Supervisory Authority for Spiritists in the state of Washington.
But Smith also says that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We don't have a real precedent to follow," he adds.
The Washington Act, called I-502, entered into force on 6 December and thus also forms the final point of a grey zone in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but the property is legalised.
And unpleasant practice issues need to be clarified at this time - for example, how the state's standard of "appropriate access" to licensed marijuana should be agreed with the ban on cannabis businesses around 300 metres around schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to find a place for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in Seattle's embalming area," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the "Centre for Legal Cannabis", a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, Chief Oates sent an e-mail to his staff in Aurora, in which he stated that the prosecutor would no longer prosecute smaller marijuana addicts in persons over 21 years of age, and that the police "from now on" would not seek criminal notices for these crimes.
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to implement urban regulations for farmers of medical marijuana and continue to pursue drug dealers.
In Weld County, North Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck has a more stringent view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly in order to move consumers to withdraw.
Currently, 119 people have to answer for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana, although many have also been charged with other crimes.
"Our authority has a duty to prosecute violations where it was a crime at the time," Buck explained in a statement.
The reactions themselves are ambiguous in places such as the rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the Marijuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer show adults for the possession of small quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to let all outstanding property procedures fall.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time exercising the right until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was already clear from the outset that it would not be easy to agree on the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the conflicting reactions throughout the state encouraged under local officials a deep twin column in terms of the large green experiment to day.
In the case of district lawyers, it is a "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents the defendant for Marijuanadelicte in court and acts as a spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuanaise Settlement.
"They've spent a lot of their life pursuing people criminally that they still can't accept legalization," he believes.
As the first countries to treat smaller quantities of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are treated as national examples for the legalisation of drugs.
While preparing for a legal sale for a period of time, defenders and state officials are also looking forward to the instructions of the Federal Government, which will continue to treat the sale and cultivation of Marijuana at federal level as a penalty.
Defenders of the legalisation movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will be represented.
Despite several recent arrests by consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government has allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other countries.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy advisors of the Obama government, believes that criminal officials are probably not going to enter the doors to seize smaller amounts of drugs, but are likely to push themselves away from legal, state-regulated marijuana businesses under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not even waiting for the Federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local authorities approved moratoriums for new marijuana businesses, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week Montrose, a city in the West, decided a six-month ban that was probably passed next week.
"We don't want to go into a position where we license someone and then stand at the federal level face a big problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our community has voted against this amendment of the law.
We look forward to what the Community has decided and not to what the state has decided.
There are still many questions open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was framed from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only university students today are attacked for their views
It has always been my greatest dream to have a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had visited that university, which I once considered to be the world’s greatest stamp of knowledge, for a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thought and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry into Worscester College at the end of the 1980s - there I had planned to study history - I had packed my suitcase again and thus led to the first scandal of my life.
My father broke up in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the flat standard it was called, I would have gone because I had a problem with having compilitons in the neighboring room having sex.
Author A N Wilson said sheelly that I would have left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less fun.
I'm gone.
Yes, I did, because I was under systematic mobbing and threats.
Not because of my very unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I had just been ridiculed for one reason - a reason that in this alleged path of enlightenment seemed so narrower and more cruel: my now dead father Woodrow Wyatt was an important advisor to Margaret Thatchers and I advocated the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Well, according to current reports, a new generation of students suffer from moderate rights under similar persecution.
The organised and increasing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that last week a group of them called for the same protection of equality, for the benefit of women, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College state that they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and unwelcomely declared" because of their political views.
They ask for a seat in their college's Equality Committee to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Their situation was aggravated by a recently broadcasted documentary on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which represented Tories as an eccentricist and neo-Nazi.
Among other things, it showed graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student association of the Oxford University, who drove in a Rolls-Royce and danced with a silver suit and silver stock.
Other universities say conservative students are considered as "sin books for the introduction of higher study fees".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the conservative student association of Nottingham University, said in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing left-wing trend in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without getting to know us at all."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and a historical student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the search for greater protection, is the view that such a climate is "unacceptable". 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, appointed president of the conservative student association of Oxford, said that she observed a growing refusal among JCR members against students of moderate rights.
"This poses a danger to the intellectual discourse and to the well-being of the members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred on the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
In the previous year, the university had voted not to grant an honorary title to Margaret Thatcher - a former student - because of cuts in high school life.
The atmosphere would even have frightened Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester, when new students and tutors met, I got a taste of future events.
I had the experience that the tutors not only endured the ridicule of Tory students, but even took part in it with joy.
Political issues such as the mining strike, the privatisation and refusal of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa found their way into the wooden caves of the tutorial.
At my first of these events, I should have translated French texts from the 18th century into English.
"Miss Wyatt," said Tutor Harry Pitt (now dead), "please translate the first paragraph".
I stopped.
Pitt was a small man with a face like a kitchenette, and pretty ugly.
"Do thatcher adherents refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students were smoking.
In my eyes, tears rolled up.
"I suggest that they take a few hours of French in your leisure - so if you are not too busy with your social activities," Pitt urged me.
I came back with my head hanging in my room.
On this evening, I sat in college alone at dinner when someone tipped me slightly on the shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James who was a member of the Conservative Student Association.
"I know who you are," he said friendly.
Unfortunately, it's like it is.
Anyone suspected of being Tory is being bullied.
It's bad enough for me, but they know that your father Margaret Thatcher is close, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory first semesters suggest being supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I tried to adjust later.
I insisted that I wasn't at all with Mrs. Thatcher on an opinion.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A student in the field of philosophy, politics and economics who, ironically, had visited the Eton College which was considered conservative, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was a pervert and fucking.
"How do Tories have sex?" asked one.
They're fighting each other, aren't they?
I felt like homosexuals had to feel before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet equals only after the darkness is broken?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that I had been standing before me spread before my spiritual eye to a fiery flame of respect and isolation.
The only tutor who openly recognized himself as a Tory was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, who had his seat in my college.
He was not only hated for being a conservative, but also because he had advised thatcher on foreign policy and had written for her reasons.
He was just rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincially and pettyly and denied it for his Marxist-determinist historical perspective.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started hanging between Oxford and my parents' house and found refuge with friends and family in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed unbelievable.
During his time in the fortieth century, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said in a low voice.
They would never do anything like that, not in my city of dreaming tower peaks.
Even my communist friends have always made use of their methods.
His wet eyes were troubled.
Give the whole guy a chance.
I'm sure you're just being denied.
It would break my heart if you went.
Exploited by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance was weakened.
One of my male friends, as well as Tory's adherents, had given in to pressure and had given up his convictions.
During a tutorial the following week, in which another historian had seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I was secretly in front of Sham, I admitted that my parents had subjected me to a "brain wash," and she called me "old trottel".
The relief lasted only for a short time.
It was my father who hit the last nail in the back of my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns per week in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my horses gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
I'd like you to call me a wine-sweety-sweety-sweety-sweety-sweety-sweety-sweety-sweety-sweety-sweety-sweet-sweet-
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer from such humiliation and abuse in an educational institution.
And it is even more tragic that it was Oxford - a university that not only produced 14 Tory Prime Ministers but still hides behind an undeserved call for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino attracts elegance of fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which was opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian modem.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This has been recognized by the designer in the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a magnificent retrospective for which more than 130 leather couture garments have been prepared, created by his "maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished client.
Valentino has always felt fascination with the sticky and distant world of the noble.
In the first room of this exhibition, which will be seen until March 3, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the most widely read Aristocracy, started by Princess Salimah Aga Khan, about the Princess Marie Chantal from Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as a trophy of his social rise from the modest fashionmaker in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the icon of the international jetset.
Being in love with the Adel doesn't have to be harmful.
"At least they don't come out on your beautiful carpet, how it does some beautiful fame from pop music," says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We are all happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the exfrequent of "Heini" Thyssen, who is close friends with forgotten beauty such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of fame.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also remembers the charisma of the modem.
Many years ago we went to him for dinner after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music, he was recognized and felt his influence.
"All the loaded felt important and loved," the "top model" is remembered, which started its career at the week of the Haute Couture in Paris in 1995.
"He never comes out of fashion because his designs are works of art," she concludes.
Modern View of Origins
Garavani's life is not a story of transgression, rather of mutual love.
He loves people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60-metre walk that proposes a roll exchange: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the walk to admire a dreamful "audence", the masterpieces of Valentino wear, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a wool and leather coat belonging to Emperor Farah Diba.
In this audience, fashion dolls reflect names such as those of Sibilla de Luxembourg, Gloria von Turn and Taxis, Mette-Marit von Norway, Rosario von Bulgaria or Sofia von Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and fashion designer, 2006
Many of these customers say, the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a shirt, a shirt, a western type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's museums.
"I draw him to all others because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty," adds the former Duke of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very; they have a lot of light and emphasize the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and the leader of opinion at the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can not forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and opportunity to wear one of his evening clothes...
At the end of the 1990s, it finally came to this.
I bought myself my first Valentine's dress for a party in the castle of my grandfather, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying rock and a draped top with a decolleté that honors his name.
"It was a true dream," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dress of the modemer "with absolute care" "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it".
The "King" of fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is Marie-Cantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashionmaker called his neighbors) were necessary to produce this eleven-boned silk dress with pearls, twelve different stickers and a four-and-a-half meter long swivel.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the top authority of the press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture in the late 20th century, "the return to the customers of the top society".
For years with the "savor-être" of the elite, Valentino is now her best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Art et des Lettres, awarded with the honorary legion, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of his clients.
"I'm always his refinement, his rest, his well-maintained and perfect outer appearance," says D'Arenberg.
I saw him last month at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of the Count Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was homeless; time leaves no trace of him."
And that's what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano are putting their lives and their health at risk when they carry 70 kilos of sulphur across the steep, rocky roads.
There are people whose work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers who earn their lives by getting sulphur from the Vulcan Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island Java.
In addition, he has to climb down to the bottom of his crater every day, where the sulphurous gas that flows out of the earth is fixed in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilos, he transports them into two bamboo bodies on his shoulders across the winding path of stone.
Although it is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the thyroid rate, while keeping the balance and taking their steps carefully so that they do not detonate and collapse.
You know that every step can cost your life, as happened to a French tourist who crashed at the Kawah Ijen partitions years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 Eurocents for every kilo of sulphur that they decompose.
To the top, they walk the way between the tourists who photograph them like circuses and run with the weary heavy bodies three kilometers to the wagon that a mining company set up a little further down at a height of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been using the events in the volcano since 1960 and (not better said) its workers, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocent) for every kilo of sulphur.
This then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocent) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widely distributed throughout the day and is used for the manufacture of stringed wood, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the bleaching of sugar.
"As we normally carry 70 kg, we receive about 46,000 rupees for each route (3.8 euros)," explains Anto, who normally makes three routes per day.
For each route, he needs three hours to complete, but at the end of the day he has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserable reward for such an inhuman effort, but the triple of what he would earn with the field work.
"The daily wage of mine workers here, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid per day and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167), is very high," explains the carrier who previously worked as a maurice on the island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a nearby village, and for a reason as important as the sulphur in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to convert her to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs often and his eyes are shaken because of the toxic gas.
The 27-year-old Anto has been playing his life at Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sweat has already left behind his first traces, even though he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs often and his eyes are shaken because of the toxic gas from the volcano.
This is the price he must pay to achieve his dream.
"I will work here for two more years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than acceptable English.
This sympathetic but intelligent young man could work as a tour guide, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a transporter.
It divides a dirty wooden cottage with other carriers and stands up every morning at two o'clock because the sulphur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines in the darkness.
Challenged by the shadow, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small starlight on his helmet, which he has bought from his own money.
About 400 wearers load the body with sulphur on their shoulders on the crater floor.
Despite its great profits, the mining company has not mechanised the welding industry to save costs, and does not supply any equipment to the carriers who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
They also do not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 Euro) charge per camera that the guards of this nature park together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 Euro) require from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human tracheal.
"This work is for animals and not for humans," protests Madrusin, a stable 42-year-old carrier who has worked for three decades since leaving the school at Kawah Ijen.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he continues to "just go", because he needs the money to raise his three children between 10 and 18 years of age.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even when the sweat burns the throat and the eyes suck, when the wind turns and the miners climb into the thick columns rising from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious diseases ... of course, except the common problems of breathing, arthrosis, pain in the knees and bladders on the shoulders that have been shaped by the weight of the body.
With the basket on his back, Unainik is only able to carry 50 kg with his 53 years.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks across a stretch path between the cage to the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life," Unainik explains, while he opens his mouth wide, in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the oldest works with his 30 years as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty keeps generation to generation in one of the toughest professions in the world: those who work as human cargoes at Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporeans blame the fact that they have no children, for their career, stress and the cost of property and education.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: We fulfill our citizens' duty and we create life!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of an advertisement for minzbonds, but yet - or just because of that - they became a viral video on YouTube in early Singapore this year.
The sentences are part of a rapper-song, the local proverbs such as "Swim will be a "bao" (laib) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which has turned the video around, maintains the hope that the advertising joke will be able to draw attention to the problem in a funny way.
Her creative leader, Douglas Hamilton, says that he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfil their "national obligation".
This is something just for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst plants in the world, so we noticed that this is a subject that we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as the marketing of perfumes with pheromones or the organisation of speed dating evenings (fast flirts).
Perhaps many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: Why don't we make something as creative as possible to deal with this problem, such as composing a rap?
1.2 Children
Whoever does not take this issue lightly is the government of Singapore.
Each year it spends $1,300 on policy measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A package of government for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, prolongs maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in Southeast Asia, which is also known for the conservativeism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its National Population Authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was over 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeans get no more kids?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Authority, says that this is due to "better training" and "more career opportunities".
"This has made it possible for people not to marry and to form a family significantly more options in terms of goals and priorities," she explains.
These changes in social circumstances have contributed to the higher number of single people and to the withdrawal of the marriage and birth, the result of which is the reduction of the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigrants in order to counter population reduction led to local populations' reactions.
In Singapore, there are websites where the barely cascade Xenophobia flourishes against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating themselves.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the government party in Singapore achieved its worst election result last year since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem of higher contributions and charges for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequence
While the declining birth rate shows the known effects on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments are built.
It already has an impact on the housing market.
The City Development Authority has started to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" and can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the life-style of the single person and that they scare the construction companies from building a large home for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out for days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
This leads to much better for our cash flow.
However, it admits that the new standards give the developers clearer guidelines that had previously been put in place if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, the talks with Singaporeans working in the financial district can be perceived as having no major effect.
"People are very stressed, the apartments and also the education are expensive, why it is being pushed out by many," says a young manager.
The children can get others.
"It is important for me to have my own money and time," says another, about twenty years old man.
Men and women lead their career, the stress and the cost of ownership and education as a reason they cannot have children.
That is why the Singaporeans have the last word when it comes to getting children - there the government can do so much more.
The offline Private offline is online private
Private
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private or "that area of private life where you have a claim for protection against any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under 16 years of age?
How is this definition applied to its everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to if he makes known online situations that he would not share in real life?
El Periodico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who are often en route to the network.
In four cases they linked the term with "something very own" on a personal level and "on the password and the user" when applying it to the social networks.
"I wouldn't disclose my deepest secrets in a post," says 10-year-old Jorge in an attempt to explain the meaning of "private" on websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know her, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not from me, or from someone who's making a fool's head," he says.
The young man is aware that it is wrong to publish obsessive photos of naked people, of crimes, or to write political or violent comments.
Jorge assures you to meet 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are related.
Among them is the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up on Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone's answering me, I'm just uploading them" he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can quickly talk to relatives in the distance or friends" he says.
He asks that he never accept an invitation from an unknown person.
Even if someone recommends to him a stranger, he would ignore this.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teen has user accounts in hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he does not know 20 of the people he has added to his friend list.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something in common, for example music," he says.
According to the boy, no one has indicated to him or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If someone bothers me or demands it from me, I just remove it from my user account" he adds.
José reported to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boys are not unknown experiences that are known today as cyberbullying.
The acquaintance of a friend was blackmailed into a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim has not closed the user account.
"He just made it private."
Then he explains a number of steps to configure a user account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or painful situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if he's unsympathetic to me or I want to get him out.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Keynotes
Marielos Porras, a teacher for English with a university degree in education and learning, believes that in order to guide children and young people, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks.
"The Internet was created as a medium for searching for information, but with the appearance of these pages the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, the owner of a master's degree in pedagogy at Yale University and the author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formulated these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who are to teach them where we are still learning," he says.
He explains that this is a complex topic, "because we require them to have a defined criterion about what is spread, published or said, and this is in an age where maturity is not sufficient."
"They should also be selective when it's most important for them to be loved to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people what is privacy is to ask them questions that bring them to mind.
"To tell them they shouldn't do it, it doesn't work," he says.
Porras then calls some options: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger. Then why do you do it online?
Or: Would you like to publish a photo of you, like what you have published by a friend?
Do you know what the others publish about you?
Have you previously asked the other people for permission when you labeled photos of holidays?
And one more question: Does everyone have to know what you're doing at any time?
Another point is to let them understand that they have to act online as they do it offline.
It's the same rules.
"Someone outside the Internet deals with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, professor of universities, primary school teachers and educators, comments that it is inevitable that parents read the social media guidelines carefully.
When they understand all sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you can share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, children need to be reminded of the lesson "You shouldn't talk to strangers".
End of the UNSUR Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the South American Union (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, which was announced in advance and should be theoretically signed by the seven governments present.
Efef repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the 6th regular meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur. Sources in the State and Presidential Office were initially informed that they would submit it after the closure, however, after stating that it would be published on the Peruvian government website for some time.
When asked about the text, they indicated that the content of the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, was presented to the press in brief statements.
The access of journalists to information on the summit was limited at any time.
During the day, only the image of the Presidential Meeting was transmitted in the pressroom with the message "private meeting, limited audio".
The few information circulated among journalists was received by the press speakers from some of the governments of the Unasur meeting, but not by the Peruvian press speaker.
The only document that was distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, which led to the dissatisfaction of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media, who demanded more information.
After that, Peru's president sent the media an e-mail with the "final statement" of the summit, but it was the statement of Humala and not the official document for the conclusion of the summit.
Last October, Peru was the host of the IIIrd South American Summit (ASPA), and even on this occasion, despite a strong call from the press, the so-called statement by Lima, which had been announced earlier, was not published.
On the official website of the ASPA you can be sure that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems were available to journalists, but they largely limited access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Hague Court of Justice, which entails a border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, met at the regional meeting and confirmed that they would take the decision of the IGH, which starts in The Hague on Monday, in the process, launched Lima against Santiago, to belong to the Pladoyers on both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences that we are currently bringing before this international court," Humala said together with his Chilean opponent.
"Chile was, is and continues to be a country that adheres to international laws, seeks peaceful solutions for disputes, concludes agreements and submits to international courts," adds Piñara and greets Humala with a handprint before the flags of both countries.
The two Presidents confirmed that they would submit to the IGH after Colombia, following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered to be a serious error to bring an action against the Bogotá Agreement, which agreed to submit to the judgments of this International Court of Justice.
At the summit, the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner were present.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from the Unasur since 2011 by its president Fernando Lugo, did not take part in the meeting.
The host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks early in the morning and concluded the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The head of state left the final document, which announced that 16 decisions had been taken and the guidelines for 31 projects between South American countries for an investment amount of $17 billion had been established.
On the decisions taken, he said that the countries of Unasur "will take significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, to which we extend the decisions on residence rights."
He announced that measures would be taken to "improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and organised cross-border crime, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take any triumphant steps, but should serve to expand our production performance and show our peoples a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 symbolic projects to improve the spatial connections in South America and especially in rural and border areas ... and thus to unite our countries and create new economic forms," said the Peruvian President in a past statement.
Among these projects would also be five Peruvians who are located on the crossroads of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which should ensure a better connection with Ecuador, although it did not provide any further details.
The final document also took note of the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country serves for its resumption in the South American Union," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourly relations was another aspect that was highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before his participation in the regional meeting that he expected a meeting with his opponent of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to address the maritime conflict following a judgment of the IGH in question.
"Perhaps I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," Santos said.
"We will examine all these ways - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also makes talks with Nicaragua necessary," he stressed.
"I hope that President Ortega will be able to say that we will be civilised and treated as respectfully as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present when the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto, took office.
As part of the summit, the bloc's defence minister met in advance to adopt the 2013 action plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, even though the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru has the presidency at the time of the regional block.
"South America must learn to integrate citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who attended the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the South American Union (Unasur), which took place in Lima, told the state television in Peru that Europeans were "in the second world war and in other conflicts" and "now practically a father country."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, which the Member States of the Unasur are leading.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community, must be improved; however, there are still more reactive sectors that are seeking a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the reorganization of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the rule of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit to anything, and in return, we always sign everything to the South Americans.
"It is inconceivable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has its seat in Washington and is funded by the United States," he said as an example of the political asylum that Ecuador granted to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured him that he did not regret this decision because he had not betrayed his principles, but had complied with his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that at the time "there were reasonable suspicions that Assanges would deliver to a third country and would not comply with its procedure."
He also criticised the Swedish court who had asked him to be interrogated in his territory for an alleged sexual offence, while "the Swedish court allows this by means of a video conference that could have been conducted via the Ecuadoran Embassy in London."
Correa stated that the risk exists that the health and mental state of Assange would be affected.
"Since he's been in our message, I haven't spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with his lungs, but not a serious one," said the head of state, Ecuador.
However, there is a danger that he will suffer physical and mental damage because he is trapped in a narrow space and cannot carry out physical exercises freely.
"This would affect the health of every person," he added.
Correa indicated that the solution for asylum, the assanging was granted since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, was the granting of a letter to enable him to travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He stressed that there was a solution to the discussion with London to find a solution for WikiLeaks' incarcerated founder.
We do not deal with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, however, there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, leads a number of procedures to various European courts," he said.
And "if Britain grants this letter tomorrow, it is done in my opinion."
And if the Swedish Mr Assange on the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or on Skype asked how the Swedish case law was allowed and in other cases the problem was done.
Correa took the opportunity to confirm herself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he did not tolerate, "the mediocreness, the evil intentions and the lies that held back the free expression of opinion."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverse politicians, but the bad journalists who seek and oppress profit," he said.
In this sense, he wished Ecuador no longer to be dominated by such journalists "and also not by the bankers or hegemonic and spy-civilised countries", and he assumed that in a re-election, "the revolution will deepen to continue its path in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the Veto against Paraguay in Unasur at least until his next election, arguing that the organism "must remain firm and must not give up any opportunism and no legally declared state strike", because "the legitimacy of democracy has been destroyed in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also holds the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which favoured the maritime state of Nicaragua, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime law borders between the two countries, for "absolutely."
This judgment is currently not implemented.
This is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be thoroughly treated so that you can overcome them and look forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion to the disputes over the sea borders between Peru and Chile before the same Court of Justice and believed that "it is right for Latin America to call upon international bodies if both countries commit themselves to accept the judgment, even if it is very hard to do so."
With regard to the possibility of becoming a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador in order to succeed in his third mandate, he said that he saw this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa said that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never interested me personally, but under such unfair circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to fulfill this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last period as president, then I would withdraw from public life.
This also applies when we lose.
"It's decided," he said.
Correa also took care of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to the Vice President of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he had travelled there for a planned routine treatment and that he would expect to be able to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not in any way mean a relapse in the health state of President Chávez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Heads of State today attended the 6th Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was concluded with the call for greater regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of death due to AIDS is today too late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed as HIV positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says about the moment he received the diagnosis that the doctor tried to "feel down" without recognizable success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; and this in such a way that he celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At that time it himself avoided the director of an IMSS clinic to vote "because it led to a baghole."
Back then, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome also with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who know nothing about their disease and where the virus has already caused damage and has developed their immune system, and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the outbreak of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases occurred, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who is taking treatment in time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said HCG's HIV unit leader Jaime Andrade Villanueva, who said that this information was supported by a respected scientific publication in April this year.
The expert on infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of immunosuppression of individuals at the start of treatment, and that those higher chances that are not drug-dependent: up to 30 years in a 200 CD4 and 50 years in a 500 CD4 count.
Simply put, the above statements mean that whoever receives the diagnosis of HIV positive at the age of 25 can be "problemly 75 years old as long as he is under control", said this expert.
In order to properly coordinate this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is on average 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico the number of people dying of AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS Annual Report), it is nevertheless correct that 60 percent of the patients surveyed in the national database have died since the outbreak of AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011 and by May this year there have already been 187 deaths; however, it is ensured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- So why do people still die?
- I think the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and that's how it's in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we have had no supply problems with the drugs. The problem is that people come to a far advanced state because they do not know their infection status, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine of ten patients come to us when they already have a accompanying infection. In order to influence global mortality, early diagnosis is necessary, so all those who need this must be offered a massive recognition test."
This proposal is approved by the experts and officials of the Council of State of Prevention of AIDS in Al-Jalisco (Coesida) and by the patients such as Fabrizio, who conducted his test at a private laboratory, for the only reason that he had made a friend of him who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS phase and even had the Kaposi-Sarkom (a cancerous tumor), which is one of the common complications.
Everything's different if you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die, and they don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I'd rather place three times," you say in my case.
The change was to improve, I feed well, drive sports and take the medications.
Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life like everyone else.
"I'm working, doing a lot, having an active but responsible sex life, I'm paying attention to my health and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to animated with his testimony those who are afraid of today's global AIDS day.
They should do the test if they belong to the risk group. The earlier they know if they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsiblely like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the loading table
There are large gaps between health programs and the simple citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has accepted the HIV issue.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In certain places "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; earlier they were handed over individually, now they give us packages with hundreds of pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Young people are among those at risk for new infections.
"What do you need it for?" is a widespread question of social workers, guidance staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health system who do not want to expose themselves to young people, the correspondent said.
He proposed reorienting this inefficient distribution; the condoms should not only be behind the laden table, but also be in publishing facilities in public toilets of facilities frequently visited by young people.
It should not be promoted promiscuously.
It should not be paid to them the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González answered the question of whether a condom would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality doesn't look like it; it's best to bring the condoms closer to those who are already engaging in sexual activity," he said.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is in the fourth place of new and cumulative AIDS cases and in the 13th place with regard to HIV.
92% of cases of inflammation occur via sex, 6% via blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people who do not know for each registered case.
After the U.S. Court of Appeal has confirmed a judgment which does not recognise the restructuring of the liabilities of the Vitro Group, which has been achieved through a trade competition in Mexico, an unsound precedent will be created for each national company with subsidiaries in the neighbouring country, which has payment problems.
It could therefore be said that the procedures for the survival of companies which allow Mexican laws do not have validity in the country of the stars and stripes in opposition to international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment received on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale at the Bancarrotas Court for the northern district of Texas leads to the loss of property by Mexican companies beyond the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens to the largest glass producer in Mexico door and door to appeal to the United States Supreme Court for three inconsistencies.
While the judge points out that creditors must be subject to the United States competition law, the Board of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, first says that this is the main procedure for the trade competition in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency proceedings of companies with cross-border profile is not known.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Standardization of International Trade Law was created for this purpose, using the American Law Institute as an excuse.
Secondly, the judgment states that, without the votes of the companies, the necessary majority for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have been reached without the recognition of the liabilities in the tendering mass of the branches of Vitro with their parent company.
However, this possibility is recognised by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agrimex and Commercial Mexicana, whose liabilities were confirmed among companies of the Group by the Federal de Concurs Mercantiles Institute.
It is also true that, following the withdrawal of the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained against Vitro in the courts of the United States, i.e. the Geier funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, had not reached a majority.
The vote would have been 45 per cent against 37 per cent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Justice.
On the other hand, there is Vitro's debt for its difficult situation since 2008 in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States that gave the country shocks.
For this reason, the González Sada family objects to the same appeal court, so that the vote will take place in plenary, i.e. from all judges, because only three of them voted.
If not given, the Cerciolare appeal shall be lodged, which requires a higher court to review the proceedings, in this case by the United States Supreme Court.
The main point in this case is that the Court left aside a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the figure amicus curiae (friend of the Court) describing the proceedings carried out by Vitro under the Trade Competition Act and pointing out that it was strictly in line with the agreements signed by the two countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Competition Act.
It is also pointed out that the country has submitted to the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for cases of cross-border incapacity to pay, which guarantee equality between debtors and creditors.
Double-banded caramboles: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the announcements by the Mexican Air Transport Trade Unions against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraud management, had not come forward for several months, the Association Union de Pilotos Aviadores (the association of the pilots) finally made progress.
The request by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now filed a criminal case against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which has been brought against the Court of Justice.
Following this, the Authority systematically refused to inform the main administration of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to remove from the trust account F/589 of Bank IXE under the name of Mexicana de Aviación 198 million pesos.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administratora Professional de Hotels (the professional hotel administration).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas Hotel Chain.
Dragon Mart is rounded
At a weekend meeting at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and sales centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country outside the wall, supplemented by a residential area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the national chamber of the processing industry) has managed to unite the governors in the southeast in order to resist the monumental institution that partially destroyed protected areas and represented the mother of all the threats of industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government of a request from the Senate to explain the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassadors signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under the English abbreviation ACTA, has not complied with, the matter has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute for Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were carried out, although the Senate had considered the possibility because it viewed them as a violation of freedom of expression in the social networks.
Homex Long-term
In order to pay long-term liabilities without prejudice to short-term liabilities, the construction company places on the market Homex stock certificates over 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four same issues that promise interest every 28 days.
Establishment of Competival
Based on the companies NYCE, e-quality and core, leading information technology companies, a company group was established under the name Competival, whose goal is the service market of the software cluster in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments amount to over $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world basketball bomber, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was connected to basketball for more than 60 years and has traveled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a great spiritual collection of the country's basketball history as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being tied to the wheelchair by an attack in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a player of lower classes, a player of the first national league, a commander and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the basketball association.
"For the rest of my life, I've spent many hours in basketball, even though I was president of the BSN, chief businessman of the National Team and president of the Association in the 1990s," Reyes recalled when visiting Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify to them.
Bayamón in the Heart
The most emotional memories are those that at his time at the Vaqueros from the middle of the 50s as a player until 1982, where he celebrated his 15-year anniversary as a business manager or manager of the club.
"It was my best years that I spent most of my life because I had been part of eight Váqueros championships since 1967 as a manager, business manager or coach.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five successive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I passed a championship in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy's debut at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over the Ortiz, which was a very good administrator," says Reyes.
I still know that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: "I have a very strong and 2 m big player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the fireman Raymond Gausse, who was a citizen and was one of our best firemen.
I still know how he said that if Mincy had allowed a championship for Bayamon, Gaussian would have cared for another one.
The Vaqueros championship with Gauss was awarded to him, but already out of a distance, because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At that time he proposed to enjoy his performances and those of Mincy in the national team.
I still know when we first won the pro-Olympic tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then came the World Championship 1990, in which we held the fourth place, which should actually be bronze, if it weren't for this Canadian judge who let us repeat the last game for the second time," Reyes said.
Was this World Championship 1990 the best national team you've ever seen?
It is one of the best, as is the one that won the 2004 Olympics against the Dream Team.
But my favorite is the team of the 1991 Pan-American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the US team a fight, as when they won bronze against us at the World Championship.
Not only Mincy, Gaussian, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculin" (Ortiz) but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colon and James Carter, brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not have been there because of a knee injury in 1990.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which provided us with great joy, was that of the 1995 pro-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitner as replacement for the locked players due to the events on the Pan-American games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against every forecast.
Who was Puerto Rico's best player?
That was certainly Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of the international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated on this level as much as Piculín.
And this without taking his career into account in the different beds in which he played.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
That is a difficult question.
We had a number of good trainers such as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arill's work.
What do you think is the best thing you've achieved in the union?
I was part of the most successful age of national team from 1988 to 1995, which included BSN from the early 1990s to 17 teams in a season.
What else do you have to do?
There are things that I would have introduced, such as regionalising the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their territory and only meet in the national playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today the children make unnecessary many trips and games.
At the very least, I see the result of the required training and courses for trainers, table officials and judges.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like listening to music, watching videos of music of my time on YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren and leaving and going to a basketball game.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always on my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, and was famous worldwide for his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played an unscrupulous, domestic and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the Habgier of the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year as J.R. in a new staff of "Dallas", died on Friday afternoon because of cancer complications according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role that he most loved," said the family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the harvest dance parties.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and sequence series, was with Hagman when he died in the Dallas hospital, said her publisher Jeffrey Lane.
He made everyone who knew him happy.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life in full trains," said Gray in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he had been drinking a lot over the years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was detected in his liver, and he underwent a transplant.
In the years prior to "Dallas", Hagman was known on television as a nice guy in the years 1965 to 1970 with the sitcom "Beautiful Jeannie" of NBC.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is put on his head when he meets an attractive "Dschinn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live at home with him.
He was also a performer of two comedies that were only beamed out for a short time, such as The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his films were "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors" well rated by the critics.
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly repulsive J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS television network over the Ewing-Clan and other figures in its surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The commercial discussion "Who shot J.R.?", which should create the expectation for an episode full of emotions, where the figure of Hagmann was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were voted in casinos.
Thus the series reached an observer record at that time.
When the answer was announced in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers, who turned Dallas into the second most popular entertainment program since the end of "MASH" 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, J.R.'s sister-in-law (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had forced her and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she didn't leave the city. But others also had reasons to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of the Ewing as a corrupt, irreplaceable man with a charismatic smile: a supportive businessman and a unfaithful husband who then sought to expose his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what to stand on J.R.'s tombstone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be called "Here lies the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only deal he didn't win.
Victoria Principal, co-sponsor of the original series, recalled on Friday to Hagman as an "extreme personality on and outside the screen".
It is unforgettable and unforgettable for millions of worshipers in the world and leaves us who had the happiness of knowing and loving him in our hearts.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success in the TV channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second staff was completed, and a sixth chapter was just turned, the sender informed.
From Warner or from TNT there was no immediate explanation of how the loss of Hagmann would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a young man when she got Larry during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck at the theaters in New York in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities have their place of residence.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Talll (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't write anything that I thought could hurt someone or affect him in any way," said the Associated Press at the time.
After liver transplantation, he applied for liver donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations take place and then," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as, "Don't worry, it's a little uncomfortable in the first place, but it's going to be good for you."
Similarly, he took a stand against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Start of the course that studies the "End of the World"
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
Every semester, when the professor of religion decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an unrestrained angle: the end of the "long countdown" of the Maya calendar on December 21, of which many believed it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what he should expect in the following two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, who called some of them "Deudarmageddon", and a growing conflict with the participation of Israel, the place from which Christian theologians believe that the apocalypse begins.
"I didn't notice that this would be the most apocalyptic semester that ever existed," Charmé told the students this week at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If someone analyzes what is happening in the world today, as if we were 30 days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he remembers that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, which should actually be the last in history.
In the temple, the visiting professor Barry Beautifulr gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas are expanding over time," he said, as well as the way in which hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they could compare themselves with real life.
"I have tried to inform the students what is possible, likely, credible and impossible," Beautiful said.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a visiting professor of art history and anthropology have formed a team to offer a course with the simple name "The End of the World".
"We don't take up 2012 so that we can always keep the option to keep the course fresh, in case the world doesn't fall," Restall said.
Despite the "necessary decline", students must study, create projects and participate in final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam is carried out on the eve of the apocalypse, so the students have no other chance of continuing until "to the night, where the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there was no place left," Restall said about his high-average student course, which was filled with 35 students.
Weeks before the start of the semester, we received e-mails from students who asked if places were still available.
The students assure them that the course is among the most interested.
"It's fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Bridgeid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers Campen for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious mentality is actually just a question of comfort or its lack.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa explains to have seen all apocalyptic films.
"I haven't heard anything from a teaching where this will be taught," he said.
I'll enjoy it.
But none of the students questioned - and less a professor - declared to believe in the last date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the prophecy of Maya, and in a certain way we discredit them," said Julie Zeglen, a student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Maya never said before the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
However, he notes that there is an apocalyptic fear in Western society that has led back centuries when people responded to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"In other places people don't think so," he says.
This is primarily the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who is teaching the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question whether he would know a course there about the "End of the World".
"The Philippines do not take part in the end of the world," he wrote as an excuse for an exception to a higher court.
We have a favor from the Pope.
Restal pointed out that many days have passed since the last trial, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people are immediately thinking about a new date" or that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period at which the end of the world will come.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said they wanted to go to parties about "the end of the world".
"Maybe I'm calling a few friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
