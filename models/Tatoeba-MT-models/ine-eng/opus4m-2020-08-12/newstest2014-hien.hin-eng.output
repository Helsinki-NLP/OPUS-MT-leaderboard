Black box in your car?
While American road planners, destroying the hive system, are fighting against the lack of wealth, many people are looking at its solution in a small black box, which fits safely on your car's dashboard.
This device, which tracks every mile driven by a motorbike and transmits that information to the authorities, has now become the subject of a controversial effort for Washington and the State Planning Office to fund the main streets of the United States.
As a general rule, there has been a sudden and profound debate and lively arrangements, such as the hives.
You have been able to keep track of the miles you have been driving, and possibly the location you have been driving - and then use this information to generate a tax bill - to allow the government to use these black boxes to add support to the library environment groups.
Tea party's on fire.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Association is also very concerned about the confidentiality of various types.
While Congress did not agree that future action should be taken, many countries are not waiting.
They're looking for ways in which they can go in the next decade to pay for every mile on the highway.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black boxes for the test drive, some of which include GPS monitoring.
It's really essential to our country.
"It's not a matter of being chosen by us," says Hamson Ikhrata, the executive director of the Southern California government, who is planning to start tracking every mile designated by motorists in California by 2025.
We're going to change the way we're paid.
It's a project to do that.
The main reason for this is that the country's High Trust Fund has become almost a dilapidate, which is paid by U.S. citizens to gas pumps.
Americans don't buy any gas before.
Now a gallon gas car is already running more miles.
There has been no increase in federal tax for the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Because of the high value of gas, government taxes also prevent money from increasing.
Transport policy at the University of Minnesota, says specialist Le Monique, "gasing is not entirely compatible."
Their government has recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test the anti-money system.
They say, "It'll work out as the most logical option in the long run."
Wongs call it the Miles-based User Shulk.
It's not surprising that this idea is pleasing to urban donors, because it can be changed in ways that can help reduce greenhouses and reduce greenhouse gases, for example.
California's planners are interested in this system while they are developing strategies to meet the goals set out in the state's global warming laws.
But the chairman of the Home Transport Committee, Rap. Bill Shuster (A.P.A.) also considers the black box the most long-term behavioural option.
Free sellers in the Regen Foundation are also on the side of per mill payment by the driver.
Adrian Moore, president of the police in Reygen, said, "It's not just going to the blind pits."
People are paying more for what they're getting.
The campaign has also been supported by two former U.S. transport officials, who in 2011 had agreed to move forward towards the anti-monetary payment from Congress to their report.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million test project last year, involving 10,000 cars.
But working on the concerns of rural planners, who were representing people who needed a lot more mile to go to work or go to town every day, Sadan's leader concluded the proposal there.
Yet many kingdoms and cities are moving in this direction themselves.
It has the most desirable Oregon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest use.
These drivers will soon pay for Miles Shulk rather than throw the kingdom away.
Nevada has already completed the initial investigation.
New York City is also moving in this direction.
Illinois is testing with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 Association, which includes the 17 state transport departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida) with the former Cebbards, are studying how they can implement this change.
This idea was not supported in all places.
In Nevada, where some time ago the device was installed on the vehicles of 50 voluntary drivers, drivers were very impatient to think that the government could monitor every step of their way.
In the Nevada Transport Department, the leaders of the strategic and operational management, Alauddin Khan, said "big brother and other things of the same kind were the main concerns."
It's not what people wanted.
As the investigation continued, the NSA of Nevada warned on its website: "It will be quite easy to turn this device into a complete tracking device."
There is no need to develop a large, unmanaged technological framework that needs to be expanded to keep a record of each person's daily arrival.
Nevada is one of many states that is trying every bit to get it, with the help of the Kingdom to describe how many miles of cars are running every day, but not where and when they are running.
Cain said, "If you can do this, people can feel more easily."
The search for this initiative has brought some government agencies to a small California startup called True Miles.
This company was not in the business of helping drivers.
It was attempting to get into the market as soon as the auto got sick, where the drivers had to pay for their mail.
But the device that is currently being checked is very nice to have high-level planners because it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is being uploaded over a certain amount of time by modem.
True Miles said, "If you don't track people's speed and their place, they'll be more willing to take this way."
These early Kingdom programs have made some major mistakes.
There are very few ways to do this, and there are very few ways to intervene.
In Oregon, planners are using different options to give different drivers.
They can choose a device from the gpss device or from the gpss device.
Or they can no longer choose to take any devices, but the averages set by the citizens of the Kingdom can choose to give a defined salary on the basis of miles.
Other places hope that this can be sold to concerned citizens by providing less and more facilities on the device.
In New York City, transport authorities are trying to develop a taxing device that will also be able to pay the parking meter charge, "pay according to your drive" insurance, and will create real-time data collection from other drivers that can be used to save from motor traffic.
The city's planning document states, "The benefits of motorcycles will attract participation."
Although, some transport planners are surprised that maybe the entire discussion on payment is a big distraction.
Metropolitan transport agencies in the San Francisco Valley region have said that increasing congress gas tax can easily solve the problem of the Davalia High Trust Fund.
Additional one-time or annual salary may be applied to drivers of hybrids or other cars, whose vehicles do not use much gas to pay for their proper share.
Randy Rentseller said, "When Espirin can work, what basic surgery is needed for her."
If we do, millions of car drivers will be worried about their privacy and many other things.
According to the police, his death is due to drowning.
In fact, the police have taken his friend for a bribe to hide the stuff from him.
The police have submitted the final report of the death trial to the court.
On August 26th, the police seized Iqbal, who lived in the royal garden of the Zelam Sea.
His relatives accused him of murder, because his cell phone and other objects were missing.
In the report, the police reported that the dead man's phone and sim's phone were tested and his phone was being used by a woman in Soura.
The woman said in question that she had been given this phone by a relative of hers.
And Roulah also dwelt in the royal garden, and she was a friend of the heathen.
And it came to pass on August 25th, when they had washed in the water, that they came to Zelem, with the Gentiles.
And the people put on their garments, and laid them on the edge of all the earth; and they went to another place to drink in the smoke.
When he returned, the Gentiles weren't there, but he had a change of clothing.
Roald sought the people, but they could not find him.
He picked up his cell phone, watch and other items and kept it for his use.
He didn't tell anyone that the nations were drowned.
The police have told the court that the death of the Gentiles is due to drowning, and that it is confirmed in Postmartam.
In fact, Rohal is taken into custody under 404 rivers to hide the objects of truth and death.

Dr. Zizendra Singh, a member of the voice of the National Activist, said Pakistan is working on a new policy to bring terrorists into line with this showdown of peace.
The lion, referring to the report by the secret agencies, said here again on Friday that Pakistan is insisting on the slaughter of terrorists in its training camps in 2000.
That's why he'll never let peace be on the border.
And Pakistan is yet a very great brier, after that she hath made mischief in the land of the Chaldeans, after that she hath made a great slaughter in Kashmir.
Referring to the Pakistani tour of tourists last year, Bezpa leader said that the ISIS Chief Lieutenant General Jahr Ul Islam, the army, the Taliban sorghum Hafiez Seed and Seed Salahudin believed that terrorism would be rescinded in 2014.
Pakistan has taken this promise seriously.
The slaughter of the soldiers at the border, and the slaughter of the Sabeans, and the slaughter of the children of Hiran, are at the heart of the strategy.
In such a situation, Zeppa, the leader, demanding the end of the military privileges in the kingdom, said that such things are also humanistic until there is lasting peace in the kingdom.
These give the anti-national elements a taste.
They insisted that the military of the leaders should be stopped from talking about the fallout of the security forces.
Snow Dan is ready to "cooperation" with Germany on U.S. Watch.
Edward Snow Dan, U.S. Secretary of State, has announced that Berlin is ready to testify to parliament in Germany if the US National Security Agency and its leaders, Keith Alexander, fail to answer about their activities.
German M.P. Hans Christian Stro Belle met Mr. Snow Dan Seguruvar in Russia, where he was given refuge to speak about the witness in Germany.
Saturday, a letter presented by Mr. Snow Dan to the media in Berlin, said: "Although the results of my efforts are clearly positive, my government believes that there is a disunity as a group - change, and does not provide any protection that attempts to criminalize the political speech with the charges of the gondad. "
Although, telling the truth isn't a crime.
In a letter, Mr. Snow Dan said that they believe that the support of the international community can rule the US government to abolish their criminal charges.
The U.S. Justice Department's round of charges includes the theft of secrets and government property.
Hans Peter Frederick, German Interior Minister, told Online Time: "Mr. Snow Dan is ready to talk to the German authorities, so we have to find ways to make it possible."
The relationship between America and Germany has come under pressure because the NSA has claimed that the Chancellor Angela Markell's phone has been bugged.
Thomas Opérman, the vice president of the National Committee, kept secret information. He said that if Mr. Snow Dan was a witness, he should take it as a witness "without completely destroying relations with America and putting them at risk," he said.
Mr. Bell, a smile from the Green Party of Germany, posted a photo of himself with Mr. Snow Dan on Twitter.
He was on his journey to Russia with two German journalists.
Mr. Bellene said that, according to the former NSA instigator, if they left Russia, they would not be able to return to Snow Dan Russia.
If Snow Dan testified in Germany, he'd be "safe" there that would require assurances, the smell said.
Mr. Snow Dan said in his letter that "they had to face a terrible and persistent campaign" they had to leave home.
While they said that the world is happy and used by comprehensive responses to "the work of the democratic expression."
The United States and the United States, together with the world's citizens, have the figures of the mystery of a comprehensive public service superintendent of a non-profit system.
The letter extends a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities "when the problems of the human situation have been solved."
Frontier Airlines Carry - On Baggage to Land
In Frontier Airlines, there is a plan to charge $100 for passengers on their flight board to store equipment.
In Frontier Airlines, there is a charging plan for $100 for a career-on-bag and it will put $2 in cash for coffee or dessert, although Wednesday announced that travellers can keep a full box.
New Carrie-on-Shulk Overhead Bin for Bags, therefore, small bags under the seat will still be sold:
Frontier said that $25 would be charged if paid in ADVANCE, would have to wait $100 if passengers waited to pay while they were on the gate.
Frontier spokesperson Kate O'Malley said that 100 percent of passengers have to get to care for their responsibilities.
"We don't want to charge him," he said.
Airlines started charging for the first and second test bags in 2008.
Those who are trying to save from the storm fill as much as they can do in the car - on the bag, which is in the top box, means there's a very small space in this box.
There's a way to get less for travelers on the shell board.
O'Malley said it's not really about adding new charges.
It's been hard for the most loyal customers about Frontier to find overhead bin's place.
Passengers who buy tickets on their airline's website should not be allowed to do this.
This means that the next person on the line can give 100 dollars for a similar bag, while a traveler on a frontier gate can get a free bag.
O'Malley said that Frontier's website and checks are changing their processes before they get the gate to make sure that the passengers know about the Facebook.
The new face-on-face of Frontier will not start to warm, even though a date has not been set.
Travelers often find dissatisfaction with Baggage and other shells, but they like the air service.
They argue that money is spent to manage baggage, and those who want to serve should pay for it.
On Wall Street, the bagage's face sees many as a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
Most of them don't even touch the car - on bag bag.
Spirit Airlines Inc. began his career three years ago, and his partner, Allegiant Air.
It's the Wizz Air of another Hungarian airline with such a shell, which is said by an airline advisor to Sorensen, and who tracks the Ad-On Face.
He said that Spirit's career-on-shulk brings $50 million in a year that was estimated in the December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former director of Midwest Airlines, recently flew into the Spirit and the passengers have had to face an unusual bag face on the gate but have won.
"The boarding process that I had seen in my airline career was easy," he said.
I was hoping to see a toothbrush and a fight outside the gate.
"The plane was full and he said it got up tickety-split."
Frontier is also tracking coffee, tea, let go, or the $2 worth of Spirit for juice.
Frontier Nekaha who will leave, or take juice they can keep the whole box, and this free coffee will only be given once.
It'll still take away the water.
At the US Airways Summary in 2008, they tried to charge for drinking substances, but after the passengers complained seven months later they moved back and followed any other main airline after they were there.
Frontier's passengers if they don't buy directly from the airline, it's your new effort to manage the frontier's steps to charge bribes on your own website.
Airlines pays the online travel vendor Orbitz like this from $10 to $25 for every other ticket.
That's why all airlines are encouraged to run passengers directly to buy from them instead of going through an online travel agency.
Frontier though, has moved on in this area.
In September, several frequent flights began to be given half of the distance to customers who bought an online travel agency from these people.
On Wednesday, it reduced the Miles Ward to 25 percent of Trip Miles.
So, an online travel agency purchased from a 1,000-mile frontier trip will be 250 miles away.
It is also that they allow you to select your seat in advance for direct purchase from the Frontier website.
There's a loyal customer base in your home city in Frontier's Denver, but it's getting low and it's losing money.
The fall of 9 percent in the kingdom and its flight capacity has decreased by about 13 percent in the first trimester, according to the continued financial results of the Corporate Parent Republic Air Holdings Inc..
They're trying to set Frontier's money as part of the sales of the Republic Airlines.
NSB charged hackers with "Internal Errors" instead of crashing the website
The Secret National Security Agency told Friday that our website had been closed for a few hours because of some lack of technology, not because of hackers, as some people have claimed online.
In an e-mail address, the secret agency said, "Today the night was not reached by NSA.gov for several hours, which was due to an internal error during the pre-specified update."
The problem will be solved this evening.
It is not true that this obstacle was caused by the widespread denial of service [D.O.S.] due to the attack.
Online Server Trackers found that the NSA website was closed for at least six hours in the evening, and for some users the site is not yet available.
N.S.A. spokesperson told A.C. News that the Agency's internal, sensitive network was not in agreement with "even".
The speaker said that no classified information was in danger.
At least one hectivist group has claimed online that they are responsible for blocking the website of DNS by D.O.S. attacks.
The CD-ROM attack is designed so that the target web site will send traffic so much longer until the site is closed because the server is overloaded.
This is an unexpected cyber strategy, and the target of attacks does not differ from the internal network of the target system.
Formerly extremely secretive N.S.A., which has ever been called the "No such agency", has become the subject of discussion between the general public and the discussion of the events of foreign and domestic social events in recent months, which have been the subject of a collectively disturbing N.S.A.'s history, hidden by Edward Snoden, after the theft of files from the agency and after the kidnapping.
Because of this increasing debate about the Agency, there have been allegations that this event was the result of a marked cyber operation after the night event.
A beautiful expression was presented in line with the phrase 'one and democracy' showing consistency in the circumstances of the present day.
It has been shown in what ways a teacher is forced to walk in the wrong way.
The drama's famous St. Joseph Inter Collegiate member, Chief Guest Minister Walmiki, the president of the camp Pashtoga, the Naresh Consul and Power Lion united.
The drama showed the similarity between the philosophy of the Dwaper Age and the current circumstances of a professor Arvind.
In the performance directed by Ail Sharma, India's horrid Sharma, Ail Sharma, Vinod Bechan, Hemanth Goyel, Sema Samar, the tribal quarterback, Abid Sami, Shiva Gajala, Amethyth, Ramesh, Arjun Adi gave a wonderful presentation of justice with the Kurds.
In the drama, the light system Youth Colorist Ziandra C. The design of the throne and set had been made by Hemhan Kumar.
In the above ceremony, the cultural, physical and cultural contributions from the apta were given a variety of surprises.
It was given to the King of the Kingdom by the President of the Urdu of Lions, Dr. Jamsedpuri, the top journalist, Shanbunatha Sukla, and the colourful Vicentra.
Srinedra Sharma, Rakesh Kushik, Abid Rizavi and others contributed to the success of the organization's work mandates.
As a delivery of air, the bombing of Bombardier's defense, the collapse of orders
Canada's aircraft and train stationer Bombardier Inc informed Thursday of a 15 per cent decrease in net profits, in their third team in their train unit and less by air command and prosecuting.
The Montreal-based Bombardier also presented no flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft to release or complete its major commercial service schedule from the next September.
About a month and a half after the first flight of the test plane, it's only blown three times, the question is whether the test is on the track.
The result was lower than expected and Share Toronto Stock Exchange sent for more than 8 percent slideshows.
Cameroon Dorsen, a senior analyst with the National Bank Finance, has reduced his rating for "the field display" from Thursday to "mort" over the next one or two months.
"The weakest aircraft suppliers were expecting more, we're clearly disappointed with the margin display in transport," Dorsen said in a client note.
We will receive a new command for Bombardier CSeries as progress of the flight testing program.
Although, if no new order is announced in the coming months, the market will likely be suspicious.
Bombardier is expected to be able to cut it down at the end of the Boing and Airbusian market.
The first test was unveiled in March and was flew for the first time in September after a month.

There are 403 full orders and prohibitions available with 15 customers and operators.
Chief official Pierre Bodoin believed that Bombardier will meet its 300 firm orders target from the time the jet was first used.
Authorities assured analysts and teachers the media that the program was running according to the index.
"The investigation was on the ground for a long time," Bodoin said in a conference call, adding it to the ground testing and software update interval.
Each creator makes a different way to create a schedule.
We've decided to fly a first flight and update a period and say what we've done.
That's why the flight program will all be through.
The other part of the five investigation flights, with the following shortly, is expected to fly in the coming weeks, the company said.
However, analysts are suspecting that customers can start a CSeries flight within 12 months of their first flight.
Bombardier said that this service list (EIS) has been evaluated and will provide an update in the next few months.
"This slow pace of air testing -- although with Bombardier's internal index in line -- confirms our opinion that the service in the entrance will be pushed into Q1/15," Dorsen said.

New research has found that we work with all honesty and dedication in the morning.

It was there when people were used between noon and noon at 6:00 p.m., that they deliberately ignored their principles.
The researchers have succeeded in proving that the desire for money in the morning does not make any difference to our honesty, but in the evening we stop giving morals.
This research is published in the latest issue of Psychological Science.

Mr. Big, the chief of the cocaine lawyer who's reporting the police investigation.
42 - year - old Bishart told criminal Neal Scarboro in the kitchen
The president thought that people could find out about his secret death cure.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool Crown Court
The lawyer at the top of the rescue party, who told Mr. Big about the main police investigation, because he was afraid of his dead cure, will be known to people about his secret latency, has been working for three years.
After a 42-year-old drought, after agreeing to his cocaine habit, Kukati criminal Neil Scarboro provided sensitive confidential information about his drug dealing investigation.
The president, who was nicknamed "Bash", and who was praised by criminals as "Top Brief", was arrested in Scarboro after the police surveillance operation in 2011, which he represented in the previous Narcotics Trial.
The authorities had seen Scarboro in Blackburn, Lancashire, wearing three cocaine bags in the lawyer's house, while he had gone out with his employees for Lo Society Diner.
After receiving cocaine from the hair of the dentist, his buttocks, and his credit card, he found that the drugs of the dentist's category A were "regular users".
During the eight-month period between August 2011, he sought information about the arrest of two persons by Scarboro and his associate.
Heroin and the cocaine group were then being monitored by the police as part of the main investigation of all four incidents in Lancashire, Kumbria, Mercecid, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 others who had been sent to prison after more than 200,000 pounds of heroin and cocaine at the price of 1.5 million pounds during several prints by the police.
Forty-two years old, while he was reporting to the guilty, for he was afraid that the people might not know the plague of his cocaine.
In Blackbound, the state law firm Forbes Solitaires was in the process of dealing with a failure in Liverpool Crown Court three weeks after the trial had been found guilty in two cases after the trial.
He agreed to keep cocaine in his previous hearing.
The lawyer's bad timing began when the police found out that he was regularly on the phone with Dita since February 2011.
Two spies followed him and saw him coming into the den and holding more than 60 per cent of the lawyer's bin in the Black Golf Glove.
After being treated with drugs, Scarboro was regularly on the phone with Dita, who had gone out for money in the Blackhorn Rover Football Stadium, Evod Park.
When the lawyer got home, he found out that he had a dead man there, and there was nine conversations between them.
It was heard in the court that he had been found "regular user" of cocaine in an examination of the hair, buttocks and credit cards of the A category in an investigation of a drug that was harmful to him.
Dita was later arrested, but she refused to use cocaine and said that she was talking to a related dealer because she was his client and said that their discussion was about "different privileges".
During his arrest, the Dita tried to remove many credit cards, but they were beaten, and her hair was taken.
In the police witness, he said he was running his office with his place of work, and his clients were calling his house for regular business.
After the arresters told them what Joshua knew about them, the court hearing said that the dentist was calling the main providers, some of whom he had previously presented the case.
Anny White from the planning side said: "The criminal president should know best not to break the law."
There's a charge of misappropriating your position as a criminal on Mr. Dent, of joining your specific client.
We're not talking about a common drug dealer, we're not talking about a drug dealer who's giving his lawyer a cure.
They will surely have some talk, for he was a lawyer.
But he went beyond his limit of relationship with the lawyer-client.
He forced the police investigation as far as possible to keep them able to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Dents were not honoring their profession, but demeaning.
He made a lot closer than some particular client, especially Scarboro, and he allowed the agreement to be made with his freedom.
Denta denied any wrong deed and claimed: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, who I am not, and if I wanted to inform Mr. Scarboro, I would not wait for 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.
But after the hearing, Lakashair Police High Representative Lee Hallstead said: "When Mr. Denta started to get treatment from organized criminals, they turned themselves into criminals."
Because of their cocaine addiction, they have reached an extreme agreement and have become much weaker for the purposes of former members of organised crime groups, who used it to obtain important information related to the police investigation.
Leaders must maintain the highest standard of faithfulness, and fill people with faith and self-confidence.
Mr. Dita has been deceived by this belief and has tried to save her profession from the horizon.
The serious and organised crime unit of Lukashair has investigated Mr. Dett, in which three cases have been found guilty of maintaining cocaine and now obstructing the path of justice, which exposes our resistance to bringing criminals to court.
This matter shall be for a warning to the transgressors, that no man is far from the coming of the law.
We'll find you and present you to the court.
14 years after Scarboro was convicted of committing heroin, cocaine, and gang rape.
Fifty other members of the group were sent to Karavas for 153 years for drug abuse crimes.
On his website, Dita gave questions and answers about herself, in which she said that her fantasy job would be to be a lawyer for a client who was sentenced to death, to be a guest of Muhammad Ali, and to be motivated by inequality for their work.

U.N. has set new goals to tackle poverty
The United Nations is about to begin its work on a new target group, which will replace all-day development goals, which were launched 12 years ago to address global poverty.
To replace M.D.D. in 2015, the Australian politician played an important role in moving forward with the "Sustainable Development Goals" that began all night in Rio de Janeiro.

Mozambique’s Security Concerns Increases as Strong Qualities

The conflict between government armies and Ré Nomo has been reported nearly daily for two weeks, more than 20 years after a peace settlement.
Rey Nomo was once part of the efforts to destabilize the country’s free government as part of his efforts to establish white ruling Rhodesia and the colourful revolution of the South African government.
After the peace agreement of 1992, it became a refugee party.
Analysts believe it's not possible to return to the country's fully developed struggle, but recent events have blighted foreign investors and local people.
The dam is rising for a faster economic system that can bring some of the companies with Eni out of the next year more than $50bn of investment from the vast optimizing gas storage and coile storage.
The ruling Frelimo Party, the main political force since 1975, and the Renomo Party blame each other for tension.
Rey Nomo says that the government launched the latest attack on its members in Sofa La Land on 17 October, a traditional Rey Nomo fortress.
In the wake of the attacks on the former rebels, the government forces again attacked Renmo and told the Financial Times of Afonso Dhaka, the group's leader, Fernando Mong, to try to kill Re Mo's spokesman.
The government accuses Rey Nomo of attacking the soldiers by accusing him of attacking the trigger.
President Armando Gybuzan has urged to ignore the concerns about instability.
Mr. Gibuzan told the French News Agency on Wednesday that Mr. Dhakama had seen himself as a "lost" "whoever his armies have tried to prove that they can apply their own decision to the government."

Some commentators have explained their use of force as a patient movement to win the government’s empires and financial robbery.
Rea Nomo's participation in the debate has been declining since 1992, while a new party was created by a former Rea Nomo member, who hopes to improve its demonstration in the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MMM).
Mr. Mong says Mr. Gibuzenko - who left office next year at the end of his second term of office - wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want a multi-ethnic democracy, he doesn't want to leave the presidency because he doesn't want peace, he doesn't want a transparent choice," Mr. Mong said.
They haven't explained what kind of capacity Ray Nomo has, but they've done it during a major hit and run on the police stations and vehicles on a north-south highway.

Children should be taught to "model a way of writing life", myths and legends.
Large stories could show, "The power of the cruel is no match for all the movements," while the importance of a dream in the Turkish continents is evident.
It will not be appropriate to teach many of the myths "even far away from the point of view of the forest and in some cases it will not be appropriate to teach it in immoral and colleges," Cross Le Holland said one of the most appropriate tasks of age.

I'm supporting this as a plan for 20 years.
They've called the writers and the teachers "multi-advertiser" and it's "a new turn" for children, along with the messages in entertaining stories.

Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New York
People can argue that the birthplace of Standup Comedy in New York City is the birthplace of Standup Comedy in the United States: About a hundred years ago, the song director Frank Fee, who worked as a festival teacher in the Pales Theatre, began to hear people in the crowd in public talk.
Fae's research has expanded over the years, most recently in New York Comedy Fostive.
This year's 10th anniversary was celebrated by Caroline Harsh, the founder of the stand-up organization, which included more than sixty shows in small clubs and big theaters.
Hirsch says, "Most of these were seen in the Carolines, and were very successful, to the extent that they became too large to be promoted to the club."
We created this celebration as a way to continue working with them.
This year's program includes the presence of Wanda Sykes, Katie Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the annual music and comedy benefits for military personnel in Madison Square Garden, "Stand Up for Heroes", which included other artists including Bruce Springstein, John Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby.
The Commodity world has also expanded, along with the enlargement of the festival.
Many of the comedians who participate in this year's celebration have come from non-traditional means, such as comedy Central, F.X., and small networks such as Spike.
Nick Crowl, DP-Cable Sitcom (F.X.A.) came to the top of the "Di Leg" with a fantasy football theme, and now their own comedy Central Sketch show.
Jenny Slate is a member of Setard Night Live and Parks and Recreation, although they are best known for their virtual video series "The Marshall Battle Show On."
Other young comedians with different voices, including Crowl and Slate, are the products of the American comedians, whose voice is completely disillusioned.
One of the most important attractions of the festival will be a witness: Talk to Larry David of David Steinberg:
Steinberg had begun to work as a standup comedian, but they have become nominee television and film directors, as well as illegal comedy historians.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show entitled "Site Down Comedy With David Steinberg" on TV Land.
This meeting will be in downtown Manhattan, downtown.
Steinburg said, "The city is definitely in the comedy d.N.A. of all Larry's actions."
They were telling me, when they were here, that sometimes they went between the two buildings and thought that if I ever lost all my money, I would stay here.
Oil falling to $96 per barrel
There is a report offset that shows concern for the cost of oil, which is continuing on Friday, where the hunger for power is growing in China.
For the delivery of December, the Benemark American Green New York Marketing Exchange was down 14 cents in electronic trading in Europe by the late morning of $96.24 per barrel.
5.8 percent fell for the month of October, Thursday fell 39 cents.
Heavy oil supplies are heavy on the price in recent weeks.
The energy department told Wednesday that the U.S. supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week

The court has blocked the activity of the New York Police Department's pause and gaming policy
On Thursday, a U.S. Court of Appeal ordered a judge to oppose the changes and remove the judge from the case.
The judge of the U.S. Circuit Court 2 And said the judge's verdict would be prolonged by an appeal through the city.
In August, a violation of the constitution led to the arrest and interrogation of people in the city of justice.
The City Police Department has also decided to appoint an observer to assist with its policy and related training program changes, its conclusions and its medical orders have been appealed.
The Court of Appeal heard arguments on Tuesday on the motion.
The Court of Appeal has said that since he has agreed on the need for a judge to avoid the presence of bias in a part of a series of media testimony, and that he must be removed from the case by misdemeanour of the behaviour of American judges through the public, it is necessary to be held public to review the case.
The judge ruled that the police authorities wrongly violated the civil rights of thousands of people by highlighting black and Spanish men with their pause and play program.
He has appointed an external monitor to monitor major changes in policies, training and monitoring, including financial improvements, and he is most shut down where he has ordered a pilot program to examine the body’s clothing cameras in some areas.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of collecting people's names and addresses after a police stop.
An oral argument on the city's appeal is indicated for some time after March 14, 2014.
The pause and play device has been discussed with civil authorities.
The pause and gaming policy has been in some way around the decades, but most black and Spanish men have been included under the administration of Free Mayor Michael Bloomberg to raise all the time in 684330-2011.
One trial was conducted by four men in 2004 by all small numbers and became a class action case.
The supporters of the NYPD's pause and play program have said that inappropriate behaviour will end with another more reliable and effective police force that can influence the use of the police department's policy.
Opponents say the changes will reduce police mobility, but crime, money shortages and not over the past decade will solve a major problem of police force pressure by thousands of authorities after the collapse.
The judge has noted that the pause and the player did not end, which is deliberate, but had improved the implementation of the NYPD stop.

Kolson used the phone hacking to confirm the secret information
The former editor of the News of the World, Andy Colson, has been charged with using "phone hacking, surveillance, and amena-samana" to confirm a so-called secret information about their personal relationships while at the time of Charles Clark's house.
Projector Andrew Addis ku.C. told Old Bally that the news of The World had heard a bad report in May 2005 that Clark was in contact with Hannah Polby's "attractive Special Adviser".
According to the court, the newspaper appointed private investigator Glenn Mulkair to hack into Polby's Waissamel and to "hold the male" but Colson also called and left Waissamel.
Mr. Addis said that "the intention of the opposing party is that Mr. Colson, who is now the editor of N.O.T.B., is not known to stand outside people's homes and watch them, but they have articles in front of people, see how people react to it."
They said that N.O.T.B. used three ways to investigate cases: telephone hacking, surveillance and amena-samana.
The third was the editor himself.
Clearly, they knew other ways, of course they knew about surveillance.
What about the first?
Did they know about phone hacking?
They say, no, we say, "Yes, they certainly knew."
The complaint about Clark's relationship was first presented by the A.T.D.W.F. Bureau, when a young woman in Susser Polby said, "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
In August 2006, Waissamel’s tape was tapped at least three times from the home of Malchair.
Investigators also found entries in the private investigator's computer that had been named "Project" by Sister Polby and their sister.
At the time they were being tested, they were being contacted by their father-in-law, who was calling for information about them.
During this time, former chief reporter Nevilley Thurlbeck and former reporter James Wederup saw the surveillance of the arrival of Sister Polby.
On June 18, 2005, Colson told them through a Waysmell: "I've got a store that we're planning to run tomorrow, which I'd definitely like to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Addis said that colson's involvement in this case is only in the other important parties, such as former House Secretary David Blonquet.
The court heard Thursday that Colson spoke to Mr. Blonquet about marital relations with a married woman, while he was then looking at the case of co-addictive Rebecca Brooks who were married.
Colson and Brooks refused to disagree with other people to hack the phone between October 3 200-9 August 2006.
Master, Türlbeck and Weather Up have accepted phone hacking.

At the direction of the Bureau (BfV), the German Home Office’s secret agency, the mission was to take a picture of the U.S. headquarters roof, which is less than five miles [5 km] from the European Central Bank and the basicsbank.
The German media told BfV to express hope to identify the presence of Licensing antenna and signaled a trade between the German Foreign Ministry in the United States and Berlin.
James Clipper, director of the U.S. National Secret, stressed that the U.S. is committed to stealing the secrets of its foreign secret capabilities "and to increasing international competitiveness for American companies or to increasing their bottom line."
But ever since Edward Snowden, a fortune - teller who has become vice-blower, the treasure of his mystery told the U.S. overseer, the European government and the leaders of the business world are no longer sure that the director is not going to keep his word.
The U.S. National Security Agency announced that the oil company in Brazil was spying on Petrobras, and our cloud suppliers, including Google and Yahoo, and Yahoo, were afraid of the emperor’s oversight.
The last thing came when it became clear that Chancellor Angela Markell's phone had been bugged, probably a decade ago.
If Europe's most powerful people can be noticed, business world leaders are definitely also targeting potential targets.
Snowdon has made close cooperation between US Secret Services and companies transparent.
I feel that it would be appropriate to use these data for mutual benefit.
Oliver Grün, president of BITMI, says "German Awakening," representing small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey published in July by German companies, America has now become almost as dangerous as China, when it comes to industrial gambling and data theft.
In all the stories, Mr. Snodon, however, has no evidence to date that America went to the business secrets of foreign companies for its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern about the lack of Internet capabilities of the European Union. And they should try to reduce their dependence on America.
The leaders of the business world are questioning this.
Someone in the German parliament said we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
Haso Platner, president of the German trade software company SAP, said "This is no way,"
If anyone wanted a strong European IT industry, he would not have let him die 20 years earlier.
All things are vanity and a striving after wind. ”
But the IT industry is everything.
Snodon's report of U.S. technical breakthroughs and Joshua's access has proved to be an attack on some companies that were previously believed to be China's biggest supervisory threat
A major change is taking place in the field of cloud computing, where European officials are more alert to the fact that the data collected in the United States is subject to the field of law and are therefore likely to become sensitive.
According to a survey carried out by a trade organization, Cloud Security Alliance, some 10 percent of non-American members cancelled the plan to use an American-based cloud provider after the release of data on the Prizm mining program.
Jim Snaba, chief executives with SAP say: "We have seen a new question that did not come to customers a year ago – that is - my data is stored? And can you guarantee that it will remain physically in the field of authority?"
Several German authorities argue that the latest reports are only confirming whether they already knew: the powerful government wants to steal their most trusted secrets and data and should keep watch over them at all costs.
It's not a surprise that economic depression is happening.
It's always been.
"It has been a topic for many years, and through the original current discussion, nothing has changed," says Kurt Bock, chief executive of the chemical manufacturer BASF.
The United States is spying on us at commercial and industrial levels, and so do we, because it's in the national interest to protect our business.
Corporate leaders generally don't want about the defense system and it's a benefit to the attacker.
For large companies, the message is being recorded for a long time, even though leaving a shop is not understood by usb stick, or a laptop is not understood to leave in a hotel room to say at least.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the car manufacturer's audio board, says that it's an old system to assemble mobile phones before board meetings because their use could not be as remote hearing devices
Germany's BfV operator is advised to consider using a simple prepaid cell phone while the Smart Phone is at risk.
The prepaid mobile phone was then dropped.
Although, small and medium-sized companies are at risk of hacking and monitoring it is a matter of concern.
In Germany, it's a lot of companies in the global market in a special place.
"Small and medium-sized companies often lack of experience, workers and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorised access," warns BfV in a report.
America has warned other countries about the financial collapse of its own companies.
According to France's The Washington Post, the name of the U.S. national secret in February, followed by China's financial statement, named after Russia and Israel, in another gang of criminals involved in hacking.
According to a German Blue Chip company board member, when it comes to making financial investments, "the French are the worst.
Bernard Squarcini French internal secret agency DCRI, former head of the witness, says: "The services know well that even though they are involved in the unwarranted war, they enjoy their partners."
The United States is spying on us at commercial and industrial levels, and so do we, because it's in the national interest to protect our business.
No one makes a fool.
The parents of a teenager in Georgia who was killed in the "unmarked tragedy" believe that their son was killed
A teenager in Georgia whose dead body was found wrapped up in a restaurant matt in his high school Jim believed that his son had been killed, the family president told the teacher.
Valdosta, G.A., was arrested on January 11 within their high school Jim Blychers.
London County Sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson was dead in a 'unmarkable accident', but the 17-year-old boy's family refused to do so.
Benjamin Rape, who presented Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told Fox News DotCom that "they must fully believe that their son was murdered."
They don't trust death at all in the way the sheriff told them.
The band said, "They believe that this is beyond the logic of physical law and common wisdom."
They believe that this conclusion is an excuse for the death of their son or for the protection of people.
They said, "He sent his son back to school with a copy of the book, and he went back to a body bag."
U.S. President Michael Mullre told Thursday that he was investigating an official investigation into Johnson's death, seeing that many important questions were not answered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his murder a result of some crime?
Mure said these things at a newspaper conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the truth. Let them lead us wherever they please."
My purpose is to bring the truth to life.
They said, "I think that there is an environmental reason for an occupational test."
Moore told the reporter that the initial SWAT test showed that Johnson's death resulted from "static SWAT".
According to Maurice, a second saw examination revealed a different cause of death."
They said: "There are many questions to be answered or to be confirmed."
Moore also said that if he finds sufficient evidence to request a criminal or to investigate civil rights in the case of Johnson's death, he will tell the FBI to do so.
Representatives were not immediately available to comment from the London County Sheriff's office when they were contacted.
On Wednesday, the South Georgia judge ordered officials to release all surveillance videos reviewed by investigators.
The boy's parents say they hope that the video footage will give some indication of how his death occurred.
CCD issued child allergy guidance for students
On Wednesday, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines to control children's food allergy in the school.
For the first time, such guidance has been issued by the U.S. government, as the number of children attending school is increasing as they suffer from allergies.
Now in the U.S., each of 20 children has food allergies.
C.D.C. found that between 1997 and 2007, food allergies increased by 18 per cent in children.
In this direction, students are informed of how teachers and workers should be informed about children's food allergy, and how to treat it in the event of an allergic reaction.
Students are also advised to keep the Epinephrine stock in order to cope with potentially life-threatening reactions (anaphylaxis), which is the autoinjector of the Epinephrine brand, which is most commonly used.
The state parliament has recently updated the rules, making it easier for students to keep the Epinephrine stock to a greater extent.
This report also contains a list of common features that are transmitted by children suffering from an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "Something's going on in my tongue," "Something seems to have a hair on my tongue," or "My tongue's going on."
Intersex kids' parents can choose their children's 's sex not determined'
Germany has become the first European Union country to approve the third sex for children born with a clear gender.
Newborn children will no longer be specified in a reverse way by men or women.
Under the new law, parents do not need to pronounce sex for such children, this law allows them to pronounce sex "undetermined" or "unspecified" on the child's birth certificate.
The purpose of the new law is to reduce the pressure on parents who can make decisions about sex-specification for newborn children in a hurry, and to fight discrimination against intersex children.
According to B.C., an intersex person said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I'm going to be a wound made by doctors, and I'm going to be a pain in the ass.
There shall be a male and a female of the two thousand children a year, according to the number of those who are numbered of them.
They are intersexes, part of a group of nearly 60 situations, which is part of a sexual development disorder test, this is a common word that is used for unusual qualities, genetics (industrials or reproduction), or unusually developed sex.
Maybe Wallace Simpson's been intersexing.
The gender identity is still not fully understood, but most experts in the United States believe that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information to specify sex and to do medical treatment, if this happens, to monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before.
In New York City, psychologist Dr. Jack Dresser, who is a specialist in sex issues, said that Germany's new law "seems to be good."
Intersex children create moral misunderstandings.
They said: "Some men are in a state of deep distress, in which there is no need for a physician, but with most children."
You can specify only sex without medical treatment, and then see how identity develops.
How any sex develops in any child is not very accurate science.
No one can answer properly why.
It's a kind of puzzle why people are homosexual.
In 2011, the European Commission reported that intersex people have been described differently than transsexual or transgender people, because their situation is not related to sex, but is related to its life-form, which is not clearly male or female, but is either composite or is not clearly defined by either.
These characteristics can show themselves secondary sexual perceptions, such as the weight of muscles, the distribution of hair, the tendon and length; primary sexual perception such as reproductive joints and genes; or qualitative structure and hormone.
This report provides insight into the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender individuals in the labour field, as well as about torture, violence and biased crimes.
Now there are special camps for boys who don't like sex.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed elderly people to mark men, women or "third sex" on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Nori Me-Walby became the world's first qualified "sexless" person to hold "unspecified" sex for life after the legal appeal was won.
According to the interior ministry, there will also be a third specification for M or F intersex persons as X in the German passport.
According to the news report on France 24, the issues related to sex in the neighbouring country of France are still controversial.
In 2011, French method designers from this strictly Catholic country signed the paper to go back to the school's book "Sex Principles".
The U.S. website's Catholic Online also opposes this German law, saying, "While the world is going to be in a state of gender choice, but not gender action, we're taking two and a half columns in the opposite direction."
In Maryland, the mother of the newborn child also told baby Jon that she would like to see the sex specified at birth.
He said on the website about parenting, "Beyond the limits, it's very stressful, especially if you don't even know what your child's sex is."
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, the children born with both genders were called Hermaphrodites (Ubiyllingi), which was named after the beautiful Greek god, who were twins.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world considered sex to be a slat that was removed and could be rewritten.
But now many people are challenging the morals of the medical profession, they understand that sex is complex work, and sometimes even doctors may be wrong, who don't know how children will feel about their sexual specification when they grow up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called "monorogens early in the morning."
When these children were born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you called the therapist.
Dr. John Mani of the University of John Hopkins presented the current principle on the treatment of undisclosed children who considered sex to be insurmountable.
They argued with the word "sex identification" and the argument that social and environmental signs -- how parents raise the child -- interact with the child's genes and hormones to identify him as a man or a woman.
But in a 1966 case, which is known as "John/Joan", the principles became controversial.
He advised a child whose parents had had had an accident during the sex harassment (Circumstance), to tie the child up completely and release the child and to be like a red - colored girl.
Dresser said, "Manny presented the matter as a success case, but it didn't happen."
At the age of 15, the child returned to become a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he killed himself.
Dresser said some doctors are still "following the same image."
But with the arrival of the Internet in the years after 1990, these sex patients began to face "not happy with the results".
This was the case with 36-year-old author Jim Bruce of Montana, who was born with X.wai.
Doctors did not clearly understand that his sex was small, or his cousin was big, but they were sure he could never live "satisfying life" as a man.
Thus, shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce’s outer limbs and the Andes were extracted by the Shelium-Cythmias and his adult daughter.
He was given a female hormone at the age of 12.
She said to ABCNews.com, "I knew I wasn't a girl."
I wasn't happy, but it was very difficult to ask.
At 18 years of age, she was going to become a virus-plasticist.
But feeling unwell and feeling some confusion, he asked for medical records.
It made him know the terrible truth.
When I was born I was bound - and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with D.S.D., which prevented his body from producing enough testosterone, causing his genes to fail to develop properly.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, he took testosterone's food and removed his mouth.
She's been tied up because of Sali-Chithesa.
Today, he explains to people about the intersex people in the interface project organization to make their ideas normal.
However, the California-based state-of-the-art Advocates for Information Switch's chairman, Ani Tamer-Matis, expresses concern that Germany's law "calls for Cyprus and Crime."
They say, "Many of the activists think that the German law will motivate parents to make a quick decision and specify the child as "undetermined."
We're afraid this will encourage action.
We think it's a better process to specify men or women than to wait.
But we don't know how the law will play its part, so we can only assume.
Tamer-Matis said his organization supports Australian law because "it allows adults to get to know the third sex."
They said, "The adults should be able to make their own decisions about sex."
The law of Germany is related to specifying it at birth.
It's not a battle to be fought by newborns at this time.
When they are grown up, they can make their own decisions about their body.
But Pittsburgh's breast radiologist Dr. Erlin Baratz, whose daughter suffers from sexual development, and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said the German law would "give both parents and children strength."
Barathji's daughter was born with traits, but she had a complete androgen-insensitive syndrome called the D.S.D.
Because his androgen was faulty in grass, women's perceptions in catheter developed.
He's got Jonny in his body, but he's not pregnant or he's a debunker.
Now 29 years old Kate is married, and Pennsylvania is resident in the Department of Child Psychology.
Although she's pregnant, she expects to be a mother through a foster or a gestational disorder.
Baratz said: "This law enables parents to make their own decisions without delay."
This gives them time to understand and understand through some tests before they write 'man' or 'woman'.
So, you're okay - raise the child, love the child.
You have a beloved child and enjoy it.
We don't need to do any medical treatment in a hurry that can't be returned.
They said, "This [Qur'an] is a decision that takes away children and relieves parents of their difficulties because they do not think that they are doing right."
Finally, the child will determine with which sex she is easier -- and it will be very good.
It enables children to make their own decisions.
A legal wake-up campaign was organized in the middle school group of Ramangar, chairman and all judges of Ramangar, chaired by the Legal Services Committee.
In which students and others were informed of the law for the right of education and the financial background.
In the camp, Advocate M.E. Hiddena, Rohan's porter, and Sarpach woke up the people who spoke on the subject.
A large number of villagers were present in the program.
Report: Consider the Biden Dumping Obama campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to New York Times, the close advisers of President Barak Obama secretly considered Hillary Clinton’s position as vice president at Biden’s location for ticket 2012.
The most significant threat in the mystery is that Mark Halperin and John Helman, the 2012 campaign Tom, "Double Down: Change Game 2012" expected.
Times received a copy of the future book, and Thursday evening told the president's top advisors what would help Obama to find out if the election was to be held again in hopes of having to drop out of the dump bins.
According to Time’s National Political Communicator Jonathan Martin, the book provides full information about the efforts of the chief officials and the change from the vice president of the former state to the headquarters of the White House, the main white house staff for the name.
The possible switch was a very safe secret within the basic framework of the Chicago campaign and inside the oval office.
Only half of the president's close advisor – including the caste, the East Obama campaign chief Jim Massina, and the East White House senior advisors David Axlrod and David Puluffe – were aware of the changes.
"Dual Down" claims that the caste tried to change the beads before finally deciding when their information was being reported would not be corrected in Obama's case by the Clinton ticket.
In a testimony with Martin, Dale confirmed that the administration had actually considered the location of Clinton with Biden.
"I said, keeping an eye on the whole view, and one of them, it was," she said to the newspaper.
You remember that the president was in danger at the time, and we were in a position like this, "Holy Christ, what else are we going to do?"
While Dredge told the research as "warning", Martin told the CNN's Enderson Cooper that the election campaign again invested importantly in finding how much this claim would benefit from Paul.
"The campaign didn't spend as much money as money and attention on focused groups until they were seriously considering something," Martin told C360.
It's unclear, Halaki, what Obama knew their team was looking for.
Martin told CNN that they had asked him if their boss knew about the possible change?
While Dade said they didn't seem to know about possible changes, the former Chief of Staff believed it was "possible" that Obama knew.
"Double Down" sure: won't answer whether Obama's desk was politically checked and reached? Martin further said.
Cooper asked Martin if they were serious about the Obama Biden dumping ticket investigation.
"Probably," said Martin.
Does Glow-In-Dark Ice Cream Care?
A British author used the world's first Glo-In-Dark Ice Cream-gelifish.
Charlie Francis has benefited greatly from marine animals in order to develop the best damage.
He came up with this idea after reading a search letter on Gelipish and Chinese reliable scientists used chemical light to re-light the protein.
This is cream, which will make the protein's PCH level more responsive to the food and the ice cream will shine.
Chris says ice cream is brighter with a warm reaction to the mouth, i.e. it will be more sharp, the more bright it will be.
Lic I M Delicias Ice cream company's founder Charlie said: "This is an incredible thing, but the production of the early days will get me about 2 grams of stuff from £200."
The protein we are using in ice cream will react with neutral pH in the language.
As soon as the mouth gets warm, the protein will increase the PCH level and the ice cream will shine.
We've been testing for the past few months and it's looking very good to share it with Halloween because it's giving a wonderful light effect.
It may be the most expensive ice cream that has been made by me, because the light of the jellifish is four times more precious than gold.
So I have to pay about 140 pounds every cup of coffee.
Even though it's very good.
Charlie's Bristol-based commercial company, beer, cheese, meat and gold card, is famous for its unusual flavor.
But its next design is going to prove even more important.
They said, “I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream.”
It's natural impossible because of the ice crystals that make up the discoloration of ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
This cream is the use of a refractory properties of gelliferous, which has been analyzed by Chinese scientists
The Queen's garden market had been full of customers.
It was recently that people had to wait between 15 and 20 minutes to buy cargo.
This is the recent Vazirpur, the extreme wind, the riverpur, the Ashok River Central Market, and the Pacific River in the Central Market.
Some of the same river was found in Pitmpura, Ashok River, and the surfaffe shops in Model Town.
The people also bought gold, and silver, and precious stones.
That's why I was drinking in other markets with the outside ring road.
Although it took hours to get home from the office.

In the end, talk to the dragon.
Charlie Brown presented the big joke when we were kids, and a Jack-O-Latten map is like decorating a Christmas tree -- that's what we did since we were little.

Cooker Spaniard Ruby fled after arriving in a small street corner
Three days later, he was seen trapped in the grave by a dog Walker.
Fireworkers brought down the front part of the rock from scratch to protect the dog from death
After being caught in the face of a terrible mountain by the pope, 50 feet from the ground, he was blessed with a life of fireworkers.
After nine months of cooking Spanish Ruby, Sunday afternoon she ran into a street corner and spent 3 days alone before being rescued from the grave.
His master Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, Denhom, were at the Flypit cave in West Yorkshire to meet him again, and he congratulated the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After a small accident, they had searched for their lost dog like lunatics, and had been posted on social networking sites.
On Wednesday afternoon at 2.15 p.m., a quick-seeing dock Walker saw Ruby, 50 feet high from the ground, in the cave.
From the clickhiton fire station, a technical rescue team arrived at the incident site and used a pet tube to bring it down from the rock to save the ruby.
Technical Defence Officer Andy Clayton said, ‘It was in a bad situation.
He stood in the midst of the rock, above and below, fifty feet.
He did no wrong during the time of his salvation. He was made a stone.
But now he's good.
Then she was eating the biscuit.
It was an unusual call for help.
Nay, but it is a dog's eyes that will not believe.
Special Technical Defence Officer Peter Loo said: "Ruby has survived fortunately."
It was possible to be seriously injured or worsened.
Ruby was taken to an animal doctor for testing, where she was found to be better than fatigue and deprivation.
From Halifax, West Yorkshire, Miss Hall said: "It was terrible to see the healing work."
At first I couldn't believe how she had got there.
It's amazing getting her back in her hands.
The animal doctor said that if she had become very tired and fell, she would certainly have fallen.
The fire department did a lot better.
What they have done is truly a courageous thing.
We are grateful to them, and they were all better.
Mr. Elderson also said, "We were afraid she might fall, but she was standing there."
The fire department did a great job.
I can't believe how she got there.
Mike Jagger says that when Cat was 18, they did not attack him
This week, during a testimony with the Australian radio show, Pon Star said he was singing the "Old Habits Day Hard" song for Jagar in 2004.
Perry said that he had spent time with the senior Rocker, and "When I was 18, they attacked me."
They said, “It is an old woman, and they treat me well.”
A 70-year-old Jagger said in a statement to Thursday that he "does not explicitly refuse to attack Katy Parry."
The representative also said, "Maybe Perry is talking about them in someone else's misunderstanding."
Parry was one of the guest singers on the Rolling Stone Tour this year.
Their new album "Prizm" reached the top of the week.

The port controls on Bervik and the walls of the Adriatic indicate the boundaries of the polar wire.
It is true that the Stratclyde Paper described the possible benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, although it was not described in - presumably - headlines.
No one described that the U.S. members spend most of their time changing their official rules according to their needs.
Since Scotland is no longer a shady area, Brussels will be free to continue non-compliance with Brussels instead of getting what it really wants from Scotland.
So, then, A-Kahani.
And the thing that's been trapped for so long has come together. First, I've heard about "freedom means passport control" almost 40 years ago.
Yet the interesting old story is gone away.
Why should you expect to build Europe from free Scotland as well?
Why would the London Joke be commercialized for Brussels, especially now?
There is real European news here: the plan to organize Europe is finally stopped, after the war.
With the Euro crisis, the project is officially dead in Europe.
Teams dedicated to opposing the U.S. in full U.S. or closing Euro as the same currency are gaining strength.
Even in Germany, the Euroscaptil Alternetiv For Germani Party - which has been founded this year - suddenly gained about 50 million votes in the September elections, thus effectively evicting Free Democrats from the founding stage.
The Union's plan to build Europe is always against domesticism.
However, the current economic crisis has proved to be a major variable.
In addition to the harsh rules imposed by the Berlin and the European Central Bank, many people are thinking that the project has gone a long way because of the obstacles imposed on national economic systems through the implementation of the same currency.
There was not much role for Euro in the excessive budget loss of national governments - that was only true in the case of Greece.
Instead, the Euro system has set the currency exchange rate for its members on behalf of German exporters - something German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of Home Currency Review, South Europe finds itself in a state of internal loss of production compared to Germany.
The only way is to reduce wages and public goods – promoted by Berlin.
The current budget and currency problems are suffering from deep European production.
The European industry pays four times for electricity and gas in comparison with the United Nations, as a result of the "harvested" energy policies set up by Brussels for the release of French and German energy firms.
It's a plausible cost of damage that we've already seen in Grangemouth.
Even if all wages are frozen in the world, the European Petrochemicals industry cannot save itself from being influenced by US Shell Gas.
As a result, there is a growing sense of rebellion among people, especially in France, who was once the main praiser of the U.S.
After the war, French top politicians saw the E.U. as a way to control Germany, and Paris as a way to provide an equal billing for the world.
But Berlin now does not need Paris as a passport for political validity, and it has applied its own financial policies to Europe, which is why France's economy is waning.
Result: The South Pan, U.S. opposition national front, has won a third-place ruling socialist in recent subjugation.
At the moment, France has the most popular group with a 24 percent vote -- this is a timely warning for the British lab that they can't assume that the left-wing will automatically benefit from the left-wing.
What is Le Pene doing with her newfound fame among the French generals, the working class?
The group wants to use e.g. the next year's U.S. election in the European Parliament to create the most loyal currency against the U.S.
If, as far as possible, the U.S. opposition groups in these elections are well displayed, this may for the first time affect European Parliament.
My view is that the EU will soon put an end to the opposition and the most loyal currency in Europe.
The euro will not be completely exhausted, but it will be broken back in a way that will be supported by the General de Gol, such as "Europe of (Lord) Nations".
Germany and some of its successive economic systems can keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will restart their currencies.
I expect the U.S. will keep itself away from this project in the hope of getting closer with the U.S.S.
However, the increasing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after all?
We can choose to build a small England area (required).
Or we can protect our own financial interests -- which involves telling Berlin and Brussels to separate at the right time.
I think Scotland can do better in the small European system, provided we keep our own money.
It will be easy to work together with similar countries in non-governmental nations in Europe.
Otherwise, we should think about maintaining our financial freedom as we walk on the road to Norway.
In Scotland, S.N.P. government - markedly - is the most successful anti-government political campaign in Europe, which won an amazing majority in 2011 on the basis of the Tori-Lib Demo Association, proposed by the Chancellor Elistair Darling.
It would be pointless for Scotland to vote for freedom at this time, because in that situation it will have to be accepted by the laws of civilisation imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Young People — A Time to Grow Up
Research shows that African-American and Spanish girls get younger than young girls when they're young.
Physical changes do not mean that young people are close
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals can be blamed
Experts believe that stability can be one of the causes of youth anger, depression
Young people in pre - Christian times may not be so effective
Former reporters of CNN Pat Etheriz are experts in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother worry if her daughter begins breast development at the age of 7 or 8 and begins to have a baby?
This week in Orlando, Florida, U.S. Children's Medical Academy, Dr. Paul Caplovitz explained that these initial physical changes are common in American girls, which show new behavior.
Caplovitz says, "I spend a lot of time giving parents this confidence -- that this usually does not show rapid progress towards full youth."
It is seen before time in the hairs of the eye, and in the eyes of the eyes, and in the eyes of the eyes, and in the eyes of the eyes, and in the eyes of the eyes, as a clear sign of development.
But in the last four decades, there's been a very simple change in the age of evolution (first monthly religion).
In the United States, the average age was 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in 1970.
"When the breast begins to develop, at least two or three years appear in the first exercise," says Caplovitz, who is also the author of the "time-to-time youth in girls: the guide needed to deal with this common problem."
The most accurate test of young people's development is time.
Young people argue about what they start, but when they grow up with breast development before 8 years old, they call it "childhood".
In most cases this process will slow down or stop - which children can monitor closely.
Endocrinologist might need to test for faster progress in order to remove potential problems such as tumors or system serious problems.
Treatments to delay time-pre-munist religion and other outcomes are: premature age-adjustment, which can lead to slow growth and aging.
Drug or hormone treatment depends on the child’s age, development rate, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
Psychological aspects are also important.
The news of the Caplovitz medications is, but they accept, "You can increase pressure on young people, and girls can feel different from their peers."
Another major problem is that parents don't just want their underage daughter to have journalism.
Caplovitz said, "They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will keep it clean."
A woman whose daughter had started her monthly religion at the age of 10 remembers, "It was a shock."
Although there were signs of this and we talked about journalism, she wasn't emotionally prepared.
She was afraid of her school and was troubled that she had started her first monthly religion among her friends.
There are many popular principles about the causes of untimely youth.
However, there is no constant evidence that hormones, chemicals, or media in milk or other food may be charged with minor messages in the environment.
Boys - just like girls - are getting young-time-early.
Caplovitz determines the rule that its main cause is anger of stability.
She helped to conduct a study on girls between the ages of 6 and 9 in 2001, which combines body weight with youth.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other contributors.
In this country, African-American and Spanish girls tend to get young before their age-old girls.
There's a lot of explanation for this.
At global level, the image of time-forming youth, from economic situations to weather and genes, seems affected by all things.
Other puzzles: Although boys get short of face and gender, the young man's way of life is not as clear as it is for girls.
Other doctors who attended the A.P. convention supported the complexity of the subject.
And it is a custom in children and children to see the nakedness of children, and the nakedness of children.
“We need to be careful how we identify the real beginnings of young people,” says Dr. Lawrence Silverman at Goreeb Childrance Hospital in Morristown, News.
Parents should not hesitate to take guidance from their child’s physician to talk to their children about this.
Caplovitz advised, "This means you can talk in advance of expected time."
If you stay calm, your child will usually answer correctly.
Pre-time developing girls need to be assured that even though this is before time, it is part of normal life.
On Friday the temperature was 3.1 degrees Celsius.
And the rain and the cold by night came upon the people: and they knew that they were very cold.
And on the morrow the people went out into the markets, and to their tents.
For the first rain is come out of the earth, and full of rain.
And it came to pass in the morning, that they saw the people enjoying themselves.
As the weather changes, work and sickness will be a source of relief, but then the sun will continue to shine as a cloud for the day.
The children also came to school wearing sweaters.
There, according to the Airfors Weather Division, the maximum temperature was 25.1 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature was 13.7 degrees Celsius.
While 7.8 millimetres of rain has been recorded.
Clouds will continue to be covered in the sky, depending on the weather.
For the width of the seat, on the large orders of the jet manufacturers.
A battle has been waged for two-month-old Arsos to fight for long-distance flights between airbuilders for the width of passenger-class seats.
In the flight of long - flying dialogues, the economic class seat is centered on the width of the seat, not always as if given by Airlines but whose assigned location has claimed to be the key to the latter jet Aerbus SAS and Boing Company.
Erbus this week has at least 18-inch (46 cm) wide seats in the Economic Cabin, but it is expected that this will be determined by the Airlines by its main-opposite Boing.
The dialogue came between the aircraft manufacturer when a large version of the related aircraft was sold from a long distance from the order after a possible 17-21 event.
How is the last section of the plane created? In particular, is the seat 9 or 10 equal to the more capacity claims are being developed, taking into account the design of the mini jumbo jets?
Boing says it's built "777 X" which will keep 406 people 17 in width and 10 people in a row in a single section.
Airbus says that by fighting with A350, it will take 350 people to a seat that is 18 inches away.
The air traffic controllers often use advertising to promote trade in technical matters.
Now, with Airbus 777 X, there is hope of attracting more than 100 orders in Dobian Arsos, appealing to the public.
Will you accept it at least three times in a restaurant, showing this to the Fencers?
Airbus sales chief John Lehi said "a long flight from Boing Regional Turbo to the intersections."
As a change, people are getting better, but the way to get on doesn't change.
According to data from the U.S. Department of Health, between the 1970 ’ s, when Boing 747 Zimbabwe was not a modern long trip, the average of 40 - 49 years of American male weight grew by 10 percent.
According to US Health Statistics, the average male room is 39.7 in the 21st century.
Airbus says it is stuck with a 1950 seat when the new name was averaged by the "jet set".
Airbus said they have set up a research commission to suggest improvement in the quality of 53 percent sleep in the width of the seat.
Boing argued on the statistics of Airbus seat size, and said that it does not depend on the decision of the manufacturers to hire airlines and make a balance between supplies.
It also says, the research reveals that more than one seat width depends on the experience of kabin.
Boing Cabin expert Kent Craver said, "It really tells airlines what they need to do to be successful and what they believe they need to do."
"What benefit do they have from not telling us?"
They know their business better than anyone else.
It's about the carbon room for flyers, but for suppliers it's a quick point that can affect I.
In the decades to come, at least 700 billion dollars of trade behind this debate is sufficient to balance the competition between the United States and European exports.
The first time in July that Reuters reported, whether the seat layout is actually the issue of fighting between new jets.
Airbus and Boing claimed that 20 per cent of their new coupled engine design was qualified as leader of the section, 365-seat Boing compared to 777-300 E.R.
The claim for Boing’s display depends on the comparison of the 10th row of 777 x to the original 9th row of 777 design.
The unit value is now used to compare 10 with profit.
Kevin Keniston, Europe's Airbus Traveler's head says, "Boing's flying is making more competition with our products and more seats."
On the other hand, analysts say that the whole 10-seat line of kabin currently 777 S suggests that a number of passengers are on the side of a denser layout, which can go with a slow rent.
Cabin's interior expert, my carbine, the founder and editor's Runve Girl Network, said "Eighteen-inch seat width would be very good for travelers, but the reality is that this commercial point proposal of Airbus is being conducted by a threat of 777."
Airbus and Boing do not provide seats but provides a list of providers to choose from for Airlines.
Also, the jet vendors around the world make careful arrangements to check out this layout competition.
With more rest, all the builders are also providing high-density air services and high-density layout for jet flights.
Aerbus is giving a 10 equal to A350 but they say it's not sold yet.
But recently, Airbus insisted on large cabin seats on some of its jet planes to require more cabin facilities.
Modern jets are not possible to fly on a new industry standard without the support of another manufacturer, but it can distort 777 X sales.
New anti-Nicotine vaccine may end the joy of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-Nicotine vaccine that can end the fun of smoking.
One of the same strains of vaccine was able to keep the mice safe from nicotine's bed for the rest of their life.
Prior to the initiation of human studies, it is necessary to carry out a test, which may take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Well Colonel Medical College in New York said the initial signs are positive.
Professor Cornell said: "We hope that the policies of this kind of vaccine can ultimately help millions of smokers who have tried to quit using all the existing methods in the market today, but they found that their addiction to nicotine is more powerful than these."
The new vaccine has a virus that has been prepared to produce genetic information for the purpose of making anti-Nicotine antibiotics.
This virus, selectively infects the infected cell, which then begins to create a permanent stream of antibiotics.
Antibodies are looking for any nicotine particles in the blood, and preventing nicotine from rising within nicotine levels by infecting them before entering the brain.
In the test, the vaccine was given to mice that were later given nicotine, they were doing their normal work.
Researchers say that although the vaccine was not given, it was a sign that Nicotine had reached its brain.
For this use, it was described in the journal Science Translating Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines had failed because they had antibiotics.
It had to feed at regular intervals to maintain the level of the antibiotic, but it proved to be noble and impractical.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be high, because the cell will make the cell a factory of antibodies.
Professor Cristal said that if the human vaccine of the future was completely safe, it could be given to children before a cigarette attempt could save them from nicotine.
But it will probably be used to quit smoking by people who smoke.
They said, "They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy smoking because of nicotine vaccine, which can help them break their habit.
British scientists pointed out the results interestingly, but warned of the need to be more researched.
Even after the postpartum, the wall could not rise because of the real death of the house.
The forest department is naturally reporting the death of the garden as a result of a massive response.
On Thursday night, Ramangar Von Prodrag's forest workers found a well of a garden near the Pakjarvesen Rezerv River.
All the members of the garden were secure, and there were no wounds or wounds on him.
On Friday, forest-protective conscience pandas, CTR's vice president Sakhat Bodola, DFO Qaksha Nismim, SDA GS Carki's animal doctors were posted by CTR's animal doctors and the Hema of Cotbag's animal doctor.
According to sources, the interior of the garden is reported to be damaged during the postpartum period.
This didn't make sense of the real causes of the home's death.
District officials were responding to the death of the garden.
However, the internal members of the garden have been sent to IVIRI well for topological examinations to confirm the damage.
The Forest Guardian Western Relation Conscience Pande said that the death of the garden can only be said to be natural.
There's no sign of the beginning of the garden.
However, it is being sent to the obscura test for confirmation of the area around it.
Tripods deny us being influenced by the Obide.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe will be tested by State Corpson Watchdog on Tripody.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripodi's maritime record that the political divide has refused to demand his political master E.D.O.B.D.'s request for East New South Wales' defender E.O.B., whose government-controlled role was selfish.
On Friday, ICAC examined whether Mr. Obied had breached several government ministers' plans for a violation of the laws of the state? Where two Obied-owned restaurants and cafes, after their time in August 2005 were renewed without a tender.
Lin Ashpole, the former Chief of Staff, was aware of Mr. Tripody's hidden selfishness of Mr. Obied's charge after the testimony to Thursday.
During the course of the talks in 2005, the government pressured public tenders to be started for panels.
The barbers were against it, and they wanted more time.
In 2009, the company of the band, which won Obied for 2.5 million dollars a year, was renovated from the sales of the band without the band.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as the Minister of Departments from February 2006 to November 2009, was at the beginning of the public tender.
But they refused to change on Mr. Obide's request, Mr. Tripody called for a change in government policy.
In a phone call presentation at ICAC, in August and September 2007, Mr. Obied and Mr. Tripod and Steve Dan, a senior official who came to the headquarters of Mr. Obied after serving in the port ministry
Assistant-led Anthony Whey asked Mr. Tripodi. "Was the discussion on the development of commercial policy in the telephone conversation?"
"No," Mr. Tripod answered.
I couldn't remember what the discussion was, but it wasn't definitely.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obid.
Officials say that Israeli warplanes ran to Syria.
The Israeli warplanes set the goal of the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior administrative officer confirmed the Fox News.
The official did not explain the purpose, but there was at least one purpose required.
The report of the Associated Press reports that the target was the Russian missile ASA 125.
Israel has attacked missiles in Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign workers can pass the "authenticity" test on 457 visas
The government is considering a "authenticity" test for foreign workers on 457 Vija, because it aims to expand a harsh operation.
If accepted, this test will be carried out by means of a warrant designed to prevent 457 family and friends who are used to fill or remove professional positions in Australia.
Today, a government discussion letter was issued, denouncing the government's previous Laber M.P. Maxin McCu today said it could anger the neighbouring countries of Australia.
Today, he told the U.S. India Institute that "foreigners are reaching the end of Qatar" and that "Australian people are working before" is a very bad time, while the Union has been demanding a safe labour market."
Historically, it was the reason that white workers should be protected -- and if some people in the area had seen the echo of that historical witness, I would not be surprised.
The discussion paper shows a framework of 12 measures previously considered by former Minister Chris Bowen.
Minister Brendan O'Conner, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met with officials on the subject, has activated five institutional changes, while the rest have been questioned.
If the "Authority" warrant is adopted, the verification of the visa applicant may be made as to whether "Name is true in circumstances in which the designated person is a relative or personal partner of the owner or of the consenting person of the person planning the visa".
Employers may need to count the number of 457 power holders, because the first entrepreneurs who wanted to organize fewer workers hired hundreds of people.
During this time, 35-year-old Sri Lankan refugees died of a similar heart attack on Christmas Island this week.
Now his nine-year-old son had been with him in the way, and on the morrow after the death of his father a certain disciple bound him, which was the son of his mother.
Australian authorities have brought the person to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The British government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project in Scotland.
The work by HS2 indicates high-speed services in the northern part of Scotland and England, which will soon begin with the first step in 2026.
Transport Minister Baronez Kremer said the project would be "British one."
Minister of Transport Keith Brown of Scotland said they are very "encouraged" by working with the British government on the project.
New high-speed rail lines will be included between London and West Midlands in the first step.
When the second step is complete, the lines reach Manchester and the lead.
In June, the government revised the cost of creating a high-speed link between London and Northern England to £32.7 billion and revised it to £42.6 billion.
The British government, which was talking to Scotland transport, directed HS2 to consider the capacity and time of the train for Northern England and Scotland and the possibility of improving the possibilities of making better travel.
This includes the possibility of three hours or less of possible travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Byrones Kremer says: "Our goal for HS2 is a real national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together."
We're moving forward with HS2, because it's going to be much more profitable.
Without it, we will face problems related to the ability of our network.
But it's also about the connectivity of 18 cities in Britain, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be better connected due to HS2.
According to Scottish Secretary of Elystairs, "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr. Carminekl's "clear" return to Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "Scotland is likely to benefit heavily from high-speed rails, but this will also increase the financial burden on Scotland in the whole of Britain.
Therefore, we are encouraged to work in the British government's participation, so that we can explore options to bring high speed rails to Scotland, generate benefits for all, and implement the Glasgow-Edinburg line, which the Scottish government is already planning.
I am ready next year to review the review report with ministers of the British government and decide on future action together.
Air - power regulations will be effective now in Australia
Despite the gentle steps taken in device management in the US, Australian air passengers must continue to stop their tablets and smartphones when they fly full-time and when they land.
The U.S. Aviation Administration has left the option to change its operations to enable US airlines to read, watch videos or play games on their device during important flight steps, provided that they remain in "Air" mode.
Travelers can still do so during many flights, but it does not seem good to be able to reach their e-book at the time of flight and landing.
Australian air service companies are considering this decision, according to which US air service companies will have much more work to do to meet this need, but they have indicated that they do not have an immediate plan to change their processes.
The Civil Aviation Security Authority also said that it is considering the announcement, but insisted that the ban on the use of electrical appliances is still effective in important flight steps in Australia.
"In the current case, CASA does not have any specific regulations governing the use of electrical devices in the air," the authority said, "this is a matter of regulations, according to which air service operators must ensure that the security system has always been fully established, and that passengers must comply with the security instructions given by the members of the driving team."
Virginia, who is already talking to CASA about expanding her in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but she asked to act on the manager's instructions.
The speaker said, "We will welcome the review by CASA in the case of the use of electrical devices, because we really think it will give customers a better experience, because now we have wireless inflatable entertainment on our planes.
Quantus said it would now comply with the current rules.
He said, "We can't use electric devices when we fly and fly, and we don't have an immediate plan to change it."
FAA decisions apply to U.S. allergens.
Thus, we are always interested in dynamic developments that can benefit travellers and we will certainly consider the reasons for the FAA's decisions and its consequences.
The impact of this decision will be different on each US air service company and will depend on their flight time.
Air service companies will need to verify that their aircraft can withstand radio operation with their mobile devices, as well as to investigate their rules of books, training materials, car-on-bagage programs and short details for travellers.
The FAA said that "After the airline has confirmed its airworthiness, it will allow passengers to use light-weight electric devices such as tablets, e-readers, and smartphones on all altitudes."
In non-visibility cases, the pilot team will instruct passengers to stop their equipment when they land.
The group has also suggested that heavy equipment should be safely placed under the seat or in the upper boxes during loading and landing.
The money of the Panbrokers because of the difficulty of the middle class in Singapore
In Singapore, at the Bendemier Shopping Center in Ponshop, Janny Amirthlinga is taking her daughter's money to pay for her school face.
She said: "My husband and I have recently bought a home, so all our money has been spent in it."
They say that although they earn 3,000 Singapore dollars as administrators (U.S. dollars), and their husbands also work, the family's monthly income is insufficient.
In fact, in parts of South-East Asia, such demand - where domestic debt is growing - became the third largest stock exchange in Singapore this week.
It's not the only way to get credit for the fall of the spell - in the case of Mrs. Amirthlinga, 1,300 Singapore dollars - but almost unsecured bank loon as easy as possible.
In Singapore, Ponbroker usually takes 17 per cent a year, which is slightly higher than 15.4 per cent of the United Surveillance Bank, which is a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, Ponbrokers have the benefit of not requiring a credit check or payment, and they can make loans faster than the bank.
In this area, millions of people are struggling with pon-shops because of the increasing cost of family living and household and consumer debt.
For five years after the global financial crisis, strong growth, and simple modern economic policies, the low and medium-sized families are starting to pay for their own needs, following a slow credit crisis.
This week's rating agency, Standards Ange Powers, told the growing domestic profits due to the growing bond (mortgage), the risk factor for Asian banks' debt monitoring.
He said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt in Asia and Singapore.
With 80 percent of Malaysian GDP, it is on top of the list, while 60 percent in 2008.
In Thailand, economists are concerned about the high levels of consumer debt, which this week is mildly affected by the technical crisis.
On Thursday, data has been shown to be low in export demand and consumer demand.
The Malaysian Bank, C.I.M.B., economist Song Sing Woon, said, "The determining point is that with increasing prices, people coming into the lower middle class will try to increase their income in every way possible."
In the past two years, the values of gold have historically high values moved people to hold personal property down, because they are taking advantage of the opportunity to build the values of their families.
In Singapore, 70 per cent of the city-state's items are gold.
People are saying, "The feeling of gold is good, let's keep the mother's gold chain down, and take it back the next month.
Thailand's largest ponshop manager, Ejimney, has seen a 20 per cent increase in the number of customers using their outlets in recent months.
There is such an increase in the fall-off business that the executives of Volumex and Singapore in Bendimir and 15 others, not only in their neighbours, are planning to expand in Malaysia where they have four shops, but also are planning to expand outside Asia, says Volumex's executive director Jah Le Ching.
The company will use 60 per cent of Singapore's $66 million in this week's listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discount landers (the lender) have been criticized for high interest rates, Ms. Jaha says that not only do other borrowers get a constant interest rate but it also does not increase the apparent debt.
They say, "Customers keep things that they already have, and don't increase building up personal property in domestic debt.
Social acceptance of ponbroking for short-term and safe financial assistance is increasing.
It's not that the Ponchbrokers only use financially weak people.
The rich people in Singapore also use the Volumex outlets, they have gold bar or rollex events that can pay up to 60 percent of their purchases.
We have customers from all classes of society.
Sister Jaha says, "It includes rich people who need to borrow for a little while for business or investment, or small businesses who need to meet their cash flow needs."
Sometimes they just need money in very little time.
India's biggest business model, Pakistani, is banned on its 50th birthday on November 1, 2013.
The principle is not in Mumbai, but in Mumbai.
They organized a huge party on this occasion.
A number of large stars of Bollywood arrived to join this party. On the late evening of October 31st, several large stars were caught flying across Mumbai Airport.

325 million-dollar security package for Tagi's health
The United Nations government has stressed that there are also harsh conditions associated with the 325 million-dollar security package to ensure that the government is not able to destroy the regime.
Minister of Health Tanya Plibersec has announced that the National Assembly, the island's older population, the high rate of germinal diseases, and the system's limitations are "early working to address the current crisis".
The decision to feed for four years was made after a government consultation with the free spirit Andru Wilki in Tuscany.
Sr. Pleibersec said today, "The government has brought the early rescue package, which we believe will solve the special challenges facing the government.
The $325 million package includes an alternative surgery plan for 31 million dollars.
A total of 2,600 additional operations, including orthopaedic and motiabin surgery, will help resolve past cases.
In Hobart and Lonstation, there is also a wealth of money to start the personal electronic health archive system after leaving the hospital, training medical professionals, mental health services and local hospitals.
Sr. Pleibersek said, "These investments are in line with the best ways I've been told to improve the health system in Tasmania by early physicians."
The minister stressed that the government of Tunisia would face severe reporting and accountability.
The government must maintain the current level of food and food in order to obtain the wealth of the nation, and report each month where the additional law is being implemented.

Mr. Wilkey said that 325 million dollars wouldn't mean much until "the public health system in Tasmania is actually reformed to achieve a more sustainable level."
Nevertheless, they commended the government for responding to their request for immediate help, which they brought to the Prime Minister in early May."
Mr. Wilkey said, "I hope that the Union's assistance package will be very helpful in separating the state's public health system from the crisis list."
According to the government, these additional alternative processes will primarily prevent recent disasters.
But the Allied Bird Health Speaker Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is "The Band-Ad Solution."
He said to ABC TV, "We're here because the Liberian state government has taken $430 million in its health system.

The monitoring group said Syria has destroyed its ability to make chemical weapons
The Monitoring Group told Thursday that Syria has destroyed important instruments to build chemical weapons and greenhouse gas war materials, while there has been a heated conflict in the northern part of Syria, which is very close to the place where poison agents are held.
As well as on Thursday, the Syrian Movement Group said that nearly three years ago, about 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the war in Syria.
This announcement by the chemical weapons organization was dated November 1st, one day before the end of the day
The Hague-based organization has decided to destroy all chemical weapons production units and toxic gases and the machine used to fill in war content or "make ineffective".
The primary goal of the initial phase of destruction is to destroy all chemical weapons in Damascus by the middle of 2014.
The destruction of the device means that Syria can no longer create new chemical weapons.
Although, Damascus still has to destroy existing weapons and collections.
Syria is believed to have 1000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including masturbating gas and Norwegian agents Serin.
The British situation of the Syrian observatory for Human Rights has reported that this announcement occurred when Thursday had an increase in the battle in Sapphira, which experts believe is a chemical weapon production unit and a storage center.
In Syria, a group that describes the number of deaths through the Net of Movement in Syria told Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
He said that 6,365 children, including 61,067 ordinary citizens, were included.
The government has said that 29,954 President Bashar is a member of the military army of Assad, 18,678 fighters on the government's side, and 187 Lebanese Hizbullah activists.
He also said that there are 2,202 soldiers in the dead, and about 5,375 aliens, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that nearly 100,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
This has not updated the data since then.
This struggle has forced some 20 million people to leave the country.
The army of the Asshurites fought against the rebels in Sephera for weeks; and many of the people were of the noncombatant.
The obstetrician told the obstetrician that people have been murdered on both sides, but clearly did not say anything.
This war represents the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who have a mission to end poisoned weapons in Syria during the war during a very short period of time.
According to the U.S.O.C.W., who worked with the United Nations, it is said that its team is "now satisfied and has confirmed - and has seen all of Syria's declared important production and mixing/filling devices - destroyed."
He also said, "No monitoring plan has been made any more."
At the beginning of this week, observers said that they had completed the first step of the confirmatory work on 21 of the 23 centres announced by Damascus.
Observers said they were unable to go to two centres for security reasons.
On Friday, O.P.D.L. said that, according to Syria, these two centres "have been abandoned and... the chemical weapons products stored there have been brought to other declared centres, which have been monitored."
It was not immediately clear that the unit in Sephera had one of the two centers, where O.P.C.D. could not be visited.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the O.P.C.B. Working Committee next month.
"I welcome the strength and encouragement you have shown by the people in carrying out the most challenging mission that this organization has ever carried out."
For three years, this house has been in the midst of the war mainly by the government of the peace and its security forces, including members of the Alawite sect from Shia Islam, and there is a conflict between the rebels among the Sunny Muslims.
In another series of events, the chief Rami Abdurrhaman said that Syria's coastal territory in Latvia had been severed on Wednesday at the Air Defense Center.
He said that the cause of this explosion is not yet known.
The police have taken copies of the network registers, net stamps, laptops and net registers from the prosecutors.
The Morty City Police have filed a case against all the defendants.
Police Commissioner Promegat Lione Gile said that in the arrest charges, Habowald, the city's political front of the moon, the circle of the circle of the moon, the valley of the moon, the mountains of the mountains, and the mountains of the mountains, included the golden ring of the moon.
The registry's office (formerly) has been run away by a blbber lion.
According to the police, the prosecutors charged the registry office with the Clarke and the Recorder Balber Lion with taking out papers from the records of empty and old lands and then buying new stamps and making net registers on them.
This was not the result of the loss of the original registry.
And they sold the land for millions of pieces of money, after they had made an accusation against the people of the land.
There they took Lonon on the paper.
After that, the real owner of the land was under pressure from the police and the administration.
The network registers had a special focus on the NRAI lands.
Because there is no guardian of the NRAIG land.
So it's easy to sell the land's network registers.
Police Commissioner Gil reported that the prosecutors have questioned whether they have already prepared network records near 150.
According to the police, Sargana's group is already involved in fraud and theft against the politician.
Crying at the court of the bomb bomber in Bali
In 2002, 202 families and relatives of the bombers who were killed in the bombing complained about the bomb planner's conviction that the age panel should face the firefighting team.
Pakque, who was fleeing as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia for nearly 10 years, was sentenced to 20 years in order to build the explosive device used in the bombing.
He can be released within 15 years of being given the password.
At 45 years of age, the killing of 202 people, including 88 Australians, and many injured were attacked by two Nightclubs in Kuta's famous travel area.
He was found guilty of many other charges of terrorism, including a series of bombings in Indonesia during the early night of Christmas in 2000.
The projectors had demanded the sentence of Adivan Karava, although they could also demand that the death penalty be the cursed "destructive person" as a bomb master.
This decision renewed the painful memories of June Cortin, who lost their 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack by Paktec and his co-engineers a decade ago.
In order to prevent his ass, he said that Pakque should be sentenced to death.
I really feel that he should have been punished just like other great terrorists.
Ms. Cortin said to A.P., "He should be standing in front of the firing squad."
I live every day without my relatives, and without my daughters.
On 12 October 2002, shortly after 11am, The Club was destroyed after the explosion of the bomb that was loaded into the van outside the club.
Peter Hughes, a bagpack filled with explosives by self-inflicted attackers, was at the pedge bar 20 seconds before the explosion.
As a result of the bombing, they went into a long coma for a month and were "dead" three times while living on life-saving devices.
Mr. Hughes said that Pakque should have received the same sentence as three other members of the Islamic terrorist group - Amoroji, Mahals, and Imaam - who had been sentenced to death four years earlier.
Actually, this person has to be executed before anyone else dies.
To keep him alive, look! He has no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and hurting countless people, 20 years of punishment is not enough.
Peck is the last person to get the punishment from the baby bomb blasts.
He survived arrest for almost a decade, but finally, in January 2011, he was arrested in the coup d'état of Pakistan, where the U.S. Army had recently killed Osama bin Laden in less than four months.
During the trial, F.B.I.A. has provided evidence that the report found that Pakque was in Pakistan in an attempt to re-establish contact between South-East Asian terrorist groups and illegal contacts with Bill Laden.
Sister Cortin says, "He didn't dedicate himself."
Even today, he's not really suffering so many people from mental distress.
This decision came before the 10th anniversary of this year's attack, which will be marked by celebrations in Bali and Australia.
Mrs. Cortin said, "This year there will be a lot of tears."
Peek can still appeal against his punishment.
F.A.: Air travel can now use a widget in the air (but can't call a cell phone)
From entering the air passenger gate, you will be able to read, work, play games, watch music, use your electronic devices - but you can't talk to your cell phone - such a teacher is still required by the U.S. Air Force.
But passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
At a news conference, F.A.'s administrator Michael Huarta said that the speed with which these changes are implemented would be different in each airline.
Airlines will need to show F.A. how their flights, new directions, and how to update the rules to show directions to their drivers' training books and to collect devices.
F.A. has said that it has already received plans from some airlines to extend the use of portable electronic devices on the plane.
Delta and Zetblu are among the airlines who have already submitted plans.
The F.A. said in a statement, "Based on the state of the plan, we can very quickly accept the extended use of the electronic device.
At the moment, passengers need to stop their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the airport is closed.
They are expected not to start until they reach 10,000 feet of air and are permitted by the captain.
Passengers are expected to stop their device again when they land on the plane, and do not start until the plane is fully down.
F.A. said that within new directions, airlines that are fully secure from electronic equipment could allow their passengers to fly by air, when they land, and when they were taxiing.
Most new airlines and other aircraft that have been audited in such a way that travellers can use the wi-fi at higher altitude are expected to meet these standards.
The president of the Association of Professional Flight Attenant, Laura Glading, has welcomed these changes.
Glading said in a statement, "When policies are safely implemented -- and we will work together with airlines to do so -- it will be a win-win thing for both sides."
When it comes to this issue, we've been warm to feel like Hall Monitors.
The Agency said, however, that it would still be prohibited to connect to the Internet at a height of less than 10,000 feet, provide email, send or receive messages, or download data.
Travelers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So still no conversation can be made with friends, such as an online Scrabble game, with a famous event related to the fact that in 2011 Akter Elek Baldwin, while playing on their smartphone while staying at the airport, and the U.S. Airlines had dropped them off when they refused to stop the device.
And like heavy equipment, laptops must still be collected at the beginning because their release will cause anxiety about hurting the other person in the cabin.
Phones will continue to be banned during the flight.
The virtual authority associated with a phone call is attached to the communication mechanism, not F.A.
F.A. may remove some restrictions on some electronic devices while flying and dropping.
Last month, Mark Roženken of the National Transport Security Council, C.B.S. News' National Transport Security Specialist, said that cell phone is still considered dangerous.
Roženkar said, "The cell phone is really serious, not only because they can possibly generate traffic on the navigation device, but also because they can produce traffic on the cell phone towers when they're in the air.
The World Advisory Committee established by F.A. to examine this issue has established last month that the government should allow more use of personal electronic devices.
Pressing F.A. to reduce usage of these restrictions is increasing pressure in recent years.
St. Claire McCassick, a reviewer like D-Mo, said there's no valid reason for security for the ban.
These restrictions are becoming more difficult because the use of the device is widespread.
Some studies also indicate that about three thirds of passengers forget or ignore their device's closing orders.
F.A. began to ban the use of electronic devices by travellers in 1996, when passengers had received reports of interference from F.M. radio and high-tech gadgets from navigation and communication devices.
New Airlines companies are more dependent on the electrical system than the last generation of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved to resist electronic intervention by F.A.
Airlines have been offering the use of wi-fi at cruising altitude for years.
The revised flights for the Wi-Fi system are also more resistant to traffic.
Huarta said that most airlines should be able to meet the requirements for more use of the electronic device within the new direction.
Today's electronic devices emit very few radio transmissions of power compared to the last generation's electronic devices.
For example, e-readers transmit the complete namespace when the page is flipped.
However, the transmission is effective when downloading or sending data from the device.
Amazon.com is also being used by travellers to reduce restrictions on the use of devices.
In 2011, the company's officials loaded their full-scale e-readers in Airlines and flew them to investigate the problems, but no such problem was found.
The F.A. Advisory Committee has expressed mixed feelings about the risks of using the device.
The National Aviation Traveler Association's Douglas Kid said they believe that the device is real, even if it's dangerous.
Other members of the committee said that only the reports described by the pilot, most of which are very old, are in support of the device's deployment to the aircraft system.
However, members of the committee arranged to allow F.A. pilots to order passengers to stop the device when they were low in visibility.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes, and they say they are the common knowledge facilities for people travelling during the most recent period of the industry.
Roger Doe, of the U.S. Travel Association, said that we are pleased that the F.S.A. recognizes that traveling with joy is not incompatible with security, security and security.
Learning from the Silsilwevar bombings in the Panda, the U.S. police have been able to provide a room for a response to the incident during the incident and during the early hours of the incident.
In order to ensure the smooth operation of the Tatayat regime, the banning of gangs of rioters, the teaching of riots, and the arrest of other gangs of those who resulted in the arrest of all 1,800 major cities in the military city, wholesale markets and other places, along with vehicles and pedestrian patrolling.
Among these young people will be female police officers with PCR, traffic unit.
City hotels, guest houses and other places with PGI will also check the records with police personnel and commands.
Thana SCHO has been instructed to organize a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate cases.
Jimma has also been assigned to the DSP with the Inspector to investigate markets, malls and other locations, including the city's VIP sectors.
The high-ranking authorities in the early days of the celebration of the situation and the demons have also determined the duties of additional police officers in the police control of the people's welfare.
The police were asked to hold high-level alerts with the Director of the Press Department and the PGI, the Chief Director and the DHS sector-16, as well as with the management of the GMS and 32 GMS, except for the staff of other Dispensers in the early hours.
Branch officials have now put another on duty under the leadership of NGIO, including female police officers, to teach lessons to the disabled.
Anti-Gunda Staff team policemen will be able to arrest and arrest the thugs in plain clothes with marketplaces.
All SCHOs on the screen are ordered to put 44 ninjas in the inner areas of the city.
Police workers will also be established at 38 Naka points on the city's borders.
The bird was left in the woods by air transport to protect from the North Sea.
The bird found on the North Sea Oil Ridge has been abandoned by air transport from the shore back into the forest.
Before returning to their Eloa-based rescue centre, Eberdin was sent by helicopter.
The Central Administrator Colin Seden said: "It was probably a winter passenger bird in northern Europe, which came into the hot air at the top of the North Sea."
It seems the bird was tired and he took refuge on the Oil Ridge.
They said, "It was impossible to fly again, so we were contacted for help."
Before he left, the district railway had recovered and recovered.
Is Europe’s high school ready to deal with Britain?
In April, business for Britain was launched and business brought together, and it was promised to determine that U.K.'s business and wealth-makers want to see changes in our relationship with the U.S.
For this we asked them what they thought of the business of Britain with the U.S., by organizing the largest and most extensive surveys of British professional leaders.
U-Gov has made representations of Britain's commercial size, areas and places for 1,000 business leaders.
The conclusions of this survey can be surprising for many people.
We have found that most businessmen now want to export out of Europe, and want to focus on countries that are becoming modern and growing, while the EU member states are not moving.
They want the government to give priority to new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than to be involved in the long-term and bad process of reforming the U.S. mysterious institutions.
When one authority asked them about specific policy areas such as the product law, most business leaders believed that control of these crucial abilities should come back to Westminster.
A single market could easily be seen of general dissatisfaction, businessmen say that the price of Brussels's administration is far more than the profits of becoming part of Europe's commercial field - even the vast businesses that traditionally owned European companies agreed on.
In the end and most clearly, our survey of professional leaders found that, a large part clearly wants Britain, the United States, to move forward on the path of trade-based relations and union change rather than politics.
This conclusion, which was seen in the levels of the main business groups, showed that businessmen are pushing towards a "material change", which will give the US back its lost power.
This is a very high price - the issue of a better deal for Britain did not change 16 per cent in the non-collection of the U.S.
The prime minister should have no doubt about this: this survey indicates that British businessmen, U.S.A., support their plan to talk about British membership conditions.
This also shows that the current power balance is expected to be reset to a useful change on behalf of the U.K.
A better deal for British businesses is possible, and it is becoming necessary very quickly, because Eurozone is moving forward towards a unified economic system and a capital union.
Priority should certainly be given to jobs and growth in Britain, as the conclusions of our survey show that business means a new focus on trade and fundamental changes in the management of Brussels.
Alexis Miler of Gazprom described the pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new cycle
The beginning of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria has marked the start of Europe's largest energy projects.
"Today a historic event has taken place: the construction of the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, which is the largest and most important project in Europe." Alexi Milar, President of Gasprom, told the teacher in a statement.
The project is a major element of energy security for the entire European continent.
South Stream will diversify Russia's export routes in Europe.
The authorities said that Ukraine, where most of Russia's gas for Europe is part of, presents a dangerous dialogue for traditional ways between the Gaza Strip and the Gaza Strip.
Miler said a member of the European Union means a direct connection to Bulgaria, ending the twin geo-republic risks associated with the countries of transition.
Following the start of the entire project in 2015, Bulgarian customers will receive gas at rates that will be released from the South Stream.
Gazprom said that construction should begin in other lowstream countries by the end of the year.
This pipeline is designed for the annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Prior to the charges against the Lord Jonathan W.M.C., the Royal Commission heard a charge of sexual offences against two employees of the Y.M.C.
In 2011, before the charge against Jonathan Lord, the caretaker of the Child Caretaker Child in 2011 has been charged with the crimes of two employees of W.M.A.N.S.D.
But in his statement to Ajum, he said that he "never faced the case of Baal Jonah's persecution within his organization," said Ajum.
The chief official was asked by Philip Herre about the case where a child pornography crime was charged with an employee at the Yai.M.A., and another case involving the charge against the Yai.M.C. Caringbah instructor of Jim in 1991 against the children who were taking care of him.
Mr. Hare, the president of the relief department, said they knew about the first case, but they didn't know about the second case.
They also admitted that the statement "Way.M.S. has been tested externally and that they have found YA.M.S. to be the best way to protect the child" is not true.
The evidence is that W.M.A. was notified, and this year received a second lowest rating in the Education and Community Quality Audit in August of the year.
Mr. Green, who has been associated with W.M.A. since the 21st century, admitted that the Lord's appointment has failed the administration of "self-with me", and failed to ensure that workers are clearly aware of their duties in reporting child protection policies violations.
At the beginning of this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences with 12 children during the two-year term of office in W.M.C.
He was sentenced to at least six years in Karab.
But Mr. Greene refused to suggest that there was a cultural problem in W.M.S., which caused workers not to report a child protection violation by the Lord.
The workers gave the witnesses what they saw about the violation, where they spent time alone with the Lord with the children, making them sit alone, sitting them in good health, saying that he loves them, and letting them play on his mobile phone.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under Lord's supervision, and he said that he was in charge of child protection training because he was concerned about his behavior, testified that the Lord's supervisor Wai.M.C.A. CaringBah Bal Service Manager Jackie Bernard was "hard to find a very threatening and most time".
C.E.O. said he did not accept the witness of the workers that they were not easy to inform their manager.
He said that, but their friend with Lord had misled their decision to inform about him.
Mr. Hare said he had given his opinion to the W.M.A.N.S.W. Assembly that the text was "not to report" to Jonathan Lord's Event.
Mr. Harree said that shortly after the prosecution came, the decision to sign a confidentiality agreement was made by the High Commissioner for Child Services Liam Whitele.
He said his aim was to avoid interference with the witness, but it was not "excited" and executed properly.
Professor Stephen Smallbon of the Griffith University's Bal Jon Exploitation said that during the period between 2099 and 2011, Jonathan Lord was not a safe organization.
He said the appointment, training, access, training and monitoring of workers were "severe problems".
The hearing is suspended until December 20.
Blair says they want Britain back.
Tony Blair said they'd want the opportunity to be British Prime Minister again -- but they believe there's no possibility of a return.
In his testimony at night on the fifth anniversary of his education from the prime minister's office, 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various home policies.
After a decade as a leader, after leaving office in June 2007, Mr. Blair refrained much from discussing British politics, limiting the role of representatives of foreign affairs and the Middle East peacemakers.
When asked whether they would like to return to the prime minister's office, Mr. Blair was presented by the London's Evening Standard newspaper saying, "Yes, yes, but it's not possible, so..."
They urged leaders not to ignore the commercial community after a financial crisis.
When a group of horse-showers gathered in Cardiff for the best horse-shower of the year, they knew that this would be a challenging competition.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
They have not even gone to school yet, and a few months away from taking their first steps, this little child and his Palatine Shetland's Tutu Tafi have easily completed three steps and won the top prize - he has left his 30-year-old opponents behind.
In the annual competition organised by the Sunny Equestrian Center in the near rudri of Cardiff, a couple who could not be separated - which is Sk's length - were highly praised for their display, behavior and style.
In front of men and women wearing beautiful baller hats, he shook his flat hat at the back of the corner and turned his two-year-old toffy into a ring.
Judges praised Fenton for his natural ability to control, which is much older than his age.
And Tofi got the highest scores for his appearance and personality.
Fenton was given the gift on his third birthday as a gift last March, and he has studied with this day-to-day Shetland forest.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, "Fonton and Toffy are a great couple."
They had to face all expectations, but they both won gold cup and rosette.
It was only the second time that he was in a competition with Tofi, and we are all very happy with his victory.
The most different in this color area, she seemed so wonderful to everyone that they wanted to take pictures with her.
This little child of Nantiglo village near Ebwell, South Wales, is following the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for more than 10 years.
Mr. Howels said, "The whole place was filled with excitement, and everyone was laughing and playing."
He was running to and fro in all the field. He did wonderful things in the sight of all who were about him.
Fonton is a monster -- he loves horses, tractors and fields, and he's got two cows he cares for.
The way he started, he's going to be showing the greatest horse of the year a long time ago, and I'm sure he'll do a very good show.
The speaker for the annual horse show said: "Fonton's age is only three years, but he has to control his own dick."
They're very good couples.
The decision-makers scored, how to display Fenton and Toffy, and how to present them in the show ring.
They saw good team work between the bush and its riders - they were the best in the Fentan and Toffy ring in this case.
I fully believe that Fonton's beloved clothes helped him, he was really looking very different.
The Chinese newspaper that argues is going to be the "aggravator"
A Chinese newspaper, which had an appeal on the front page to abandon the defendant of Manhani, will be arrested, said a press judge.
The New Express newspaper of Guangjo provided a massive public argument for the release of journalist Chen Yongjo.
But after that, Mr. Chen admitted on television that he had agreed to write a report on the state-owned part-time company.
Vinyamk said that the new expression must now be "completely corrected".
The order for "repair" came from the Guangdong Press and publications, radio, movies and television administration.
"A preliminary review showed that the New Expression of the Young Evening News Group had been printed in many false news about the Listed Company’s Jumplion since mid-August 2012.
Vinyamk said in a statement that "the editorial management of the new expression was unregulated."
He said he had decided to impose an administrative penalty "by cancelling the license of the Chen Hong Kong reporter."
It " instructed the Young Evening News Group to improve a complete new expression, to provide an immediate review of the people responsible for it in the new expression and to review the leadership of the new expression."
Mr. Chen wrote in many articles in the New Expressions that condemn financial irregularities in a construction-up company called Jumullion.
After they were released, their newspaper published two main appeals for their release, and said that it supports Mr. Chen's journalism.
But then Mr. Chen agreed to write and publish false stories for government television.
He told C.T.V. the government broadcaster, "In this case, I have damaged Jumullion as well as the entire media industry and the ability to win people's trust."
I did this mainly because I had a desire for money and fame.
I've felt my mistakes.
After Mr. Chen's forgiveness, the New Expression continued an apology, saying it had failed to check their report properly.
Recently, many high-profile users have admitted widespread misdemeanours to TV.

Self-propelled railways found in the U.S.-Mexico drug mine
One of the most complex drug exchanges between the U.S. and Mexico has been found, including its own lighting, ventilation and electrical rail systems.
U.S. officials have described four-foot features as one of the most complex hidden ways to search for three-foot mines.
The mine is about six feet long, which connects to the Tijuana, the nearby godom and San Diego, U.S.S.A.
This area is filled with one of the same mushrooms, which makes it easy to hide a drug-filled truck.
The authorities said it was closed before a drug went through the mines.
According to the court archives, the authorities have seized half an eight tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine, in connection with mine search.
Three people, about whom the authorities said they were operating as drivers, were charged with having Marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute.
If they are convicted, they may be sentenced to 10 years from Karav, from Karav and to Avivan Karav.
In Noglas, Arizona, the Thaskers benefit from large, land-based streams of water.
This mine is the eighth main road in San Diego, which has been discovered since 2006.
In October, a search for some of the largest mines in Central Mexico has been made after the Marijuana crop, which presents a challenge for drug forgiveness groups to quickly bring the product to users.
In 2010, officials found a route of nearly 700 goges decorated with railway tracks, which was spread from the roof of a house in Tijuana to the San Diego godoms.

British police sent Anja a confession note
The British Police sent a return note today to the founder of Wikilex, Julian Asji, who has taken refuge in the Ecuadoran embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said he sent 40-year-old Australian Assize a "dedication note" for which they would have to attend the police station, and said they would be responsible for arresting themselves if they failed to do so.
In fact, the young criminals are facing a complaint in Sweden, as well as their options under the British law ended when the Supreme Court rejected their appeal against a complaint at the beginning of this month.
Stockhom would bring them back to the U.S., with fear they had asked for asylum in the Ecuadoran embassy in London on June 19th.
One speaker said that Scotland Yard sent "40-year-old Assize a self-dedication note for which they needed to attend the police station on the date and time they were elected by us."
They're in violation of the terms of their authority.
The ambassador refused to comment on the police note.
Astja is afraid that more than 250,000 U.S. encryption-opposing websites on Wikilix will be represented by the United States to deal with possible terrorist charges.
With a hot drink between the feet, the 130-mile-per-hour car driver is fined at £1,000.
On the driver, a thousand pounds (£1,000) have been fined for driving at 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) of hot drinking between the feet.
Tiptri, 35-year-old Andru Howie of Essex was seen running his Mercedes Benz on May 27 in Brentri.
When the police stopped them, they found a bottle of tea on their feet.
In the Colchester magistrate's court, Howie has accepted the benefit of driving a car with a lack of care.
Their license added seven points, which has prohibited them from driving for six months.
Howie was also ordered to charge 90 pounds (£90) and 100 pounds (£100).
Foreign property owners will end London’s artificial situation
The Finance Department has traditionally counted CGT measures, but is awaiting the final decision from Mr. Osborn, who presented a stamp duty of 7 per cent in the 2012 budget of more than 2 million pounds, as well as a person who prefers to live in a company instead of a separate person.
In 2012/13, Stamp DUT 708 million pounds, which is already more than the combined sum of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and the North East, North West and Yorkshire and Hamber, remained in the cities of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea.
Mr. Cook said: "After the presentation of an increase in the stamp of high-valued houses and the Associated Anti-Evadens statement, it is very difficult to argue that there is the least appropriate tax on the high-value property, which has nothing to do with the influence of the system since it was old.
They added that "but this step may make it difficult to sell some foreign investors in London to buy goods and to sell existing owners."
According to estimates in rich South-West London, the top 5 to 10 per cent of the home market, which is spread from Fulham to Wumbledon, has increased 11.8 per cent last year.
According to Seville's research, the rate of regular growth of 5.6 per cent per year in the values of Central London continued, but the increase in the market was somewhat lower, as the city's south-west, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent).
Scientists have also shed light on the relationship between the dog’s tail and its mouth.
Previous research has found that happy dogs move their tail more to the right (from the dog’s standpoint), while unscathed dogs move their tail mainly to the left.
But now scientists say that partner dogs can recognize this tiny secret and express their reaction to it.
This study is published in Journal News Biology.
Professor Georgia Wellertigara from the University of Trento said: "All people know that the left and right parts of the brain are involved in different ways in the stimulation that produces positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to see it among other nations.
They told him that the right side of the dog was also responsible for the left hand's movements and vices, and that the two were involved in the emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the movement of each other through other dogs, researchers watched animals in other dogs’ films.
They measured the heart rate of the pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
We probably won't take more time to understand why their mood sometimes moves on one side.
Prof. Wellertigara said: "We presented dogs with dog films - in a shadow-image to deal with the exactistic version of the dog or other points of confusion, and we were able to see the height of the cat and present the cat more to the left or to the right."
And it came to pass, when the beasts saw the dog, that they moved upon their backs: and they were at rest.
But when they saw him turning his back, they turned aside mainly to the left (from the dog's sight), and their hearts became troubled, and they became troubled.
According to Professor Wellertigar, they don't think dogs were consciously communicating with each other through these incidents.
Instead, they feel that dogs have learned from their experience about what to worry about and not about.
They said: "If thou dost find (other) dogs, and if they keep moving about with one another, it will be more fitting for thee to do so; but if thou dost set forth (for thy purpose) as a friend in thy right hand, then do thou set forth (for thy purpose) the like of it."
Researchers say that these conclusions can provide better information about animal feelings to owners, veterinarians and trainers.
Professor John Bradshaw of the University of Bristol, guest of the School of Winter Science, said that it is not the first study to examine whether the dog is important to the left or the right.
Last year, the University of Linkon team found that when dogs see an aggressive dog, they turn their heads to the left and turn their heads to the right when they see a happy dog.
In another research by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "In contrast to the Italian study - when the robot was moved to the right-hand side, it was more likely that the dogs would get closer to him than the rest of the dog."
He said that this was because in various studies dogs did not completely understand animals or robots in movies.
He explained that it can help study how dogs react to real dogs.
"While many evidence has been found from various mucous membranes that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more information is still available -- and dogs are not exempted in this case," he said.
Although, with the ease of their behavior, it seems that we will probably not have more time to understand why their mood ever shifts to each other.
Alex Turner’s disease caused an Arctic manicure to stop Glasgow Gig
The rock bank, the Arctic Menkiz, has stopped Gig in Glasgow after being beaten by its main singer.
On Friday, the Sheffield Group had a program to show on the hydro site in the city.
But their main singer Alex Turner's illness forced them to redefine this show date.
The band's announcement came when they were obliged to hold Gig in LG Erina on Thursday in Burma.
In a statement on his official website, Arctic Menkiz said that after taking medical advice tonight after deciding to stop the show at LG Erina, Arctic Menkiz must also stop the show at Glasgow Hydro on Friday.
"Alex Turner got shot in the test, and they're not really capable of showing."
The show will now be held at LG Arena in Burma on 20 November, and the show will be held at Glasgow Hydro on 21 November.
All tickets will be accepted for this show.
We're sorry for any inconvenience that's going to happen to all the ticket holders.

Pope Francis will announce the first Cardinal in February
Vatican announced to Thursday that Pope Francis would establish the new Cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his work on 22 February.
Cardinals, the high priestess of the Catholic Church, are only below the pope, and these people choose the pope, so Francis will recruit the first group of his people, who will eventually help them choose their successor.
There's a total of 201 Cardinals right now.
Thus, after 80 years of age, Cardinal is not allowed to participate in the pope's election - it comes in a group of 120 "Cordinary voters".
In a speech announcing the news, Vatican spokesperson Father Federico Lombardy said that all current Cardinals' meetings, known as the Popes, will be held before the ceremony of the New Cardinals.
Lombardy said, "Pop Francis has decided to announce his decision to organize the pope-in-chief of February in order to make it easier to make plans for other meetings attended by Cardinals from different countries."
Jack Vallero of the Catholic Voyage said that by February the number of cardinals was likely to be reduced.
He said that the pope generally announces the number of Cardinal voters as low as 120, both Cardinals, and according to their wish, the names of Cardinals over 80 years of age.
Vallero said that next year's Pope's meeting would be important, because this year will be the first Pope's meeting after the election of France in March.
Currently, Europe and especially Italy have a kind of precedent.
He said, "It will be interesting to see whether the new pope, the rest of the world, is using Cardinals to restore the balance.
Forty percent in South America are Roman Catholics, but in Cardinals their number is very low.
Cardinals by Francis, who is a group of eight Cardinals from all over the world, whose work is to seek ways of reforming the church, will also be the first to be elected after being formed.
The Pope used to make all the decisions himself.
He said, "Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him."
He said it's "possible" to ask the French Cardinals for advice.
But we're not before in this situation - it's completely new.
Vallero said that the pope generally gives the bishop of great places a position of cardinal, but Frances "would have been quite surprising - so we don't know who they're going to pronounce their name."
Callback to be issued by GM to the U.S.
On Friday, according to information provided by the U.S. Auto Security Propellers, the General Motors Company has called back nearly 19,000 trucks to correct a deficiency in the hand-turning seat in S.S.S.S.S.R.P.T.
In some trucks, the front seat rotation system may be reduced.
As a result, the United Nations Auto Security Standards for Head Restoration failed.
According to an information posted on the website of the National Road Safety Authority, "If the vehicle is caught from behind, it may not be possible to protect the headrest, the proper way of the driver, thereby increasing the risk of injury."
The models were created between August 1 and September 10.
The G.M. truck started being sent to June and, after the 2009 demonstration update, the top shows the most important Vohan Launch for the U.S. Automaker.
G.M. told the truck owners about this mistake in October.
N.S.M. 16-day government ban, which forced an increase in auto sales in October, could not review the owner's notice letter.
G.M. said on Friday that, in the sale of Silverward and Sierra Trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, there was 20 percent increase in this year's first 10 months.
In October, G.M. sold 42,660 Silverwood and 16,503 Sierra Pickup Trucks.
On Friday afternoon, a 1.4 percent increase in GM share in New York Stock Exchange.
The Discouragement of Obama’s Prophecies
I gave Obama twice to expect change
They say Obama's great efforts have been hampered by the opposition policy of the G.O.P.
Obstacles to Obbamaker’s Web site’s policy cannot counteract drone attacks
The 2008 Obama Campaign commemorates what might have happened
There are second-year students at the National P. Moris Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a lot of sad books today.
This is a book that I think this second year will encourage me during medical school's convictions and give me hope.
Its name is "Courage of Victory", and it is the anniversary of the 2008 election campaign of President Barak Obama.
When I wake up at night from the bedside of my patients and go to bed, this book takes me to a time where politics has inspired millions and talks could keep you from breathing.
Elections have been proven, and news speakers have stopped to show the historical importance of the time.
The eyes of my fellows were on joy; and my father and my mother kept every letter that was found.
A group of young people were going to the White House, and the whole country was ready to change.
In 2008, they had an 82% approval rating during Obama's presidency.
Then I closed the Book.
The present truth is a harsh truth, like returning from the world of dreams.
It's hard to remember those days of hope - they seem to be a distant memory, a painful memory of the times that have passed away.
The first time that I got paid by me really changed.
Simply say, I couldn't have imagined any of this.
I commend Obama for a lot of supplies, from the Afordable Cairo Act to the back of our army from Iraq, "Don't ask" to the end of Osama bin Laden.
In addition, I believe that the policy of opposition has prevented many efforts to move forward in our country: including non-violent reform, public access to health services, barriers to the closure of Guantanamo Bay, and others.
But the many times that I've taken my side of Obama's administration with my colleagues and colleagues, I've got the answer to what I can give them.
I've reached the point of political disappointment.
The Republic's opposition to politics is not the answer to the threat of foreign leaders, nor is it the answer to drone attacks on children in other countries.
The National Security Agency is unable to respond to the collection of data on the personal life of American citizens, nor can it respond to the use of people who expose the wrong practices of the government.
It can't explain the cause of the murder of American citizen Unver El District without a trip, nor the lack of public law and business limits during the presidential campaign.
It cannot answer the conclusions of the report, which says that the White House is trying to silence the media "the most shocking since the Nixon administration."
And last but not least, it cannot justify the failure to design a simple website even three years after it is signed in the Afordable Cairo Act.
I don't know what I was expecting.
If, at 18 years of age, I had to assume that the government system could break the political campaign that would lead to it.
Clearly, the uninhabited office is not a predictive way, because opposition political groups and memorable events such as the Newtown massacre will shape our public debate.
However, the examples I have given above most of them seem to be chosen by the administration.
This is most disturbing to you.
I voted back for Obama in 2012, but not because I was famous for his hope.
Mitt Romani presented a misleading and uncertain option that did not seem to determine their policies or their position.
It seemed to me that another time would come for Obama, who would be free from the pressure of future elections, to fulfill the hopes that we have long heard of.
However, while Obama's license rating is less than 45 per cent this week, it has become very difficult to return to 2008.
When I see him, I remember the promises they've lost.
This week he was reading a portion of the book, which described how Clinton was badly damaged by Obama in Pennsylvania Prime Minister.
At a post-martam campaign meeting, he told his subordinate workers that they needed to return to the panel, and that they needed to remain faithful to their purposes.
They said, "I want my mojo back."
We should remember who we are.'
Today, five years later, President, I can't agree with you anymore.
The thoughts expressed in this comment are of the Nataniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that P.M. Tony Abbott is a good match for the father's vacation plan.
Arab husband M.P. Clive Palmer said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott's good fight about the father's holiday plan is because their daughters may become pregnant and benefit from it.
Maharathi of the Khann region, like 6 million dollars in carbon, has argued with Bill's payment, while they have tried to answer questions about the fight.
The Palmer United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which can be important in determining the reduction of carbon and minerals.
But Mr. Palmer claims that only ministers can fight well, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters can benefit personally from politics.
Mr. Palmer said, "They may have an important fight in the matter of paternity leave, because if any of their daughters are pregnant, it would be a clear good for them whether or not they are given leave."
Two months after the election, the election campaign officially declared Mr. Pomerer to be the winner of the Sunshine Cost Seat of the Firefax.
Mr. Palmer requested that the process be speeded up to speed up the election.
The daughters of Tony Auto, French and Brigette.
Should the outcome of our choice be two months after we have been awarded?
They said, “We have a better system.”
Why can't we have a system where we fill out our computer details, vote immediately, and have results at 6:30 p.m.
Mr. Palmer also discussed the use of a brush to mark the letters.
That's because if someone doesn't like it, can you remove it?
The use of pencils during today seems to be completely pointless.
Selection tools, studying options for electronic commerce, and recently launched a joint protocol with New Zealand.
59-year-old Mr. Palmer said his policy was to create an international air barrier for Sunshine Coast, and they would take their new work "very seriously".
Public service is for public service.
They said, “We have received a great reward from history, so that we may serve the people at a time when there is no reward for us except.”
Which caused the adversaries to be troubled.
Referring to the meeting held on this occasion, the Association President Ramesh Lioni voiced a strong complaint about the country's corrupt law system.
They said, "The rebels and their families have been more and more rabid than ever."
There is no fear of the police and the administrative system.
He recently mentioned events like this in different places, saying that when the president's society is not safe, the general human security can be easily estimated.
RBS delayed two forex traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign currency, two scientists from the case received this information, another indication that the global speed of research by investors in the foreign currency market is advancing.
The UBS Barclay, the Dutch Bank and some of the world's largest banks, including RBS, have confirmed that the world's largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion is donated every day, is being co-operated with investors in the survey.
These two traders will be the first employees of RBS, who have been suspended with further investigation of the alleged recurrence of the Free Interbank Loans.
The bank has refused to comment on the delay and has confirmed that the bank has received a request for information from the investors this month.
Two weeks ago the bank said, "Our investigation is ongoing, and we're working fully with FCA and other investors."
Last month, scientists said that RBS sent the former trader and sent the archives of e-mails and quick messages to the UK Vinjam, financial behavior authority.
Richard Usher left RBS in 2010, and it is believed that it has been released from its current position by Forex Spot Trading in J.P.M.
The main European spot trading trip to the city was last week by Rohan Ramedani, while the former superintendent at Barclause and UBS was suspended by the Standard Charter this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrong action.
The case was told by scientists that Mr. Eusher's rapid message group included banks of Barclays and the sitigroup.
UBS said that, after being told by Swiss Vinyamk, the film has been investigating the link between Swiss currency markets in many Swiss bakeries, he has been acting against some of his employees this week.
At least six world-wide authorities - European authorities, cinema, Switzerland, FCA, and Hong Kong Federal Authorities - are investigating allegations of discreditation in order to ensure that they are able to transfer their products to the currency market.
People familiar with the case reported that HSBC, Citigroup, J.P.M.G., and Credit Switzerland have also conducted internal checks, or have received requests for information from investors.
Banks are looking for a misdemeanor as fast as many years of e-mail and e-mail.
The news of the investigation-reading industry has given rise to confusion in traders in the field, who have been among the most profitable users in the trading unit of investment banks since many years, but are facing this year's challenge because of the low drop-outs in the country.
Some bankers have tried to suppress the case by saying that it is impossible to transfer large and highly liquid foreign currency to the exchange market, but top traders say it is not necessary to do so.
The senior trader said that the use of foreign currency in spite of the vast scale of business sales between the separate trading platform and the increased use by banks of its own platform means that "you can start to influence the market on a small scale."
The news came the same day that Credit Switzerland announced its exchange trading funds desk in London to the trader this week, which lost about $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank has immediately notified the co-ordinated authorities and is cooperating with its investors.
Credit Switzerland said, "We believe that the trader has worked alone, and he has been controlled."

The Supreme Court supported Obama’s health service law
As a major victory for Obama administration, the U.S. Supreme Court today announced the health service law on behalf of Barak Obama.
From 5 to 4 opinions, judges decided on the basis of the different orders of the Health Security and the National Care Act - which citizens will need to purchase or punish health before 2014 - that it was within the government's power to prosecute.
Chief Justice John Robert supported the court's four other donor members, while other judges, Scalia, Thos, Elito and Kennedy, won dissatisfaction.
The Court has also supported the remaining sections of the law on 2700 pages, and said that the condition of the Health Service Act to increase the eligibility of the State medical profession or that all of them will witness the maintenance of the United Nations medical funds is not fundamentally unfavourable.

In the case of Nortel Pentant, there is a financial debate on Google, Sassamong, Hawaii.
The group of owners of thousands of former Nortel patents has brought many patents to trial on Thursday, along with cell phone makers, which it had driven into the Nortel pipeline.
The Rockstar Association, which purchased Norettel Patents in 4.5 billion, has prosecuted patent violations in Texas, U.S.S.Z.A., against Samsang Electronics, Limited, H.C. Corporation, Huaya, and four other companies.
The property of Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple Microsoft, Blackberry, Erickson, and Gold.
There's a charge of breaking seven patents on Google.
The study said that these patents also include the technology that combines words that are searched on the Internet with words that are consistent with advertising, which is the main part of Google's search business.
Couldn't contact Samsang, Huai, HTC and Rockstar representatives immediately.
Samsang, Huai, and H.T.C. all make phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which is hard to compare with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google launched a $900 million talk for Nortel patents.
Google has finally proposed a $4.4 billion increase in speech.
After losing a rock star in Nortel Pentants, Google bought a motor mobile in $12.5 billion, a major reason why motorola had to have a long list of patents.
According to the report, "Even though Google has violated patents-in-suits in the Nile, despite trying to avoid it, Google has been continuously violating"
Rockstar has called for increased injury against Google because it claims that the violation of patents by Google is a violation.
Believed in the first freely elected president in Egypt
Mohammed Morsi has taken his oath of office, but their victory day in Egypt may have ended the political struggle.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised "New Egypt" when he took up his office as the first freely elected president of the country to replace Hosni Basak 16 months earlier.
On its official establishment before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi Arabia has become the fifth president of Egypt, the world's independent first Islamic president, and almost 60 years before the political system was removed.
And they took an oath by the river of the river of the river, even as the ancient Egyptian temple, unto 18 judges who had the charge of the blacksmiths in the court.
Morsi said during an official ceremony on national television show: "We are looking forward to a better future, new Egypt and other republics."
Moorish Muslim Brotherhood, who has been an illegal organization for 84 years since its establishment, and who is on the brink of the last governments, trained engineer at the U.S. party, said: "Today the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life - complete freedom, genuine democracy and stability."
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen protected the building and, according to local time, came to Morsi's small cemetery shortly after 11am.
Only a few hundred supporters were gathered outside the court to congratulate the president's new president from the smoke of the day of May, and the Tatayath had been banned for a short time, so that his motor Cafile would leave the streets normally occupied, which connects the city center with its southern suburbs.
Bradhirhud's unscrupulous "Kali Tire" made a huge increase in Morsi's personal dignity after their victory and on Friday their speech not only presented them as Islamists but as hopeful of all those who want to carry out the 2011 conspiracy against the Tanashak.
Morsi, wearing a blue suit and a red thread, swore to the judges in the wooden panel, saying: "Today Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional, and modern nation."
Afterwards, Morsi Cairo went to the university, where they had to give their opening talk.
The army band played national flag and received their official welcome, while they stood in the currency of the warning.
The military governors were also present, Marshall Husan Tantavi.
On their arrival, hundreds of people who attended the University Department of Understanding welcomed the cry "Sena and other people are one hand."
Founded in 1908 as the foundation of an independent religious school, Cairo University later became the foundation of Islamic student groups in 1970.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath in the Square, which is the origin of the uprising, which ended last year in the Tanasak regime, and took an oath to take back the powers of the military leader who had been removed from their position by the military.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the court, rather than taking an oath of allegiance to the parliament, they bowed to the will of the military, which indicates that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in the Square was filled with dramatic popular coins.

In the camp, the country's president, Zahyu, told Narayan Lion that the workers' munion would soon be announced in the 20-sute committees.
Their signal was that the list is almost ready.
It is now news that the Prime Minister will evaluate the list from his own level.
They'll also check whether it's been the opinion of the lawyers-members to make a list.
If necessary, resize the list to fit the old and restricted actors.
It is common for lawmakers-members to charge that they were not considered to be on the list of menonions.
The names of the people who came from the other groups have been included in the list, while many important actors have been ignored since the days of the Conciliation Party.
Some people are born with silver spongiform, and some make life by their own efforts, and they are inspired by them.
In such personalities a name comes from self-resistance.

Their great brother Ramnikkalal had made all the laws for them, and they were not in trouble to get a job abroad.
But there was something else going on in the mind of patience.
So in 1954 they returned to the estate.
In 1955, Mumbai entered the pockets with $500 in cash.
And that's where their business trip started.
From there, the patience of the Ethiopians increased, so that he never returned.

Their sons, Mizpeh, are at the moment, and their kingdom is in charge of the burnt offerings and the sin offering.

According to this report, the EU government has spent $8.5 million over the past four years to celebrate the power of the ruling panel.
Instead, during the time of Andy's reign (between 1999 and 2004) in contrast to Modi's claims, there was no announcement by the government during the time of the U.S. Navy's P.M.P. for two consecutive years (2001-2002).
On Thursday, Modi, based on the image of the 182-metre-high 'Stachu of Unity' image in the Gujarat headquarters, said, "Before that, there was no advertising on the occasion of the captain's giants.
While the record of the DVP states that in 2009-10, the EUA spent EUR 30 million, EUR 4.10 million in 2010-11, EUR 2.7 million in 2011-12, and EUR 1.4 million in 2012-13 on the announcements by the Chief Panel.
When central information and publications were asked from the Minister of Human Rights Tuesday about Modi's claims, they said they don't speak on the basis of the MP candidate facts of BZPP.
There was no advertisement on the panel in the EUP in 2008.
And Tuesday said it was because of the financial crisis that year.
Although the fees spent on the announcements of the chief panel are far less than the fees spent on the members of the Nehru-Gandh family each year.
DVP spent 33 million for the genius and revitalization of the Magnesium, 21 million for the East PM, 14.5 million for the Indira Gandha, and $9.38 million for the Red Nehru.

Moving forward with dust, rivers, and forests to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Well, offering free health services in the rural areas of Cameroon
Well and their team see hundreds of diseases every week
There is not much medicine in Western African countries; there is only one physician for 5,000 people
Set your vow here or use your mobile phone
Dr. Georges Well in 2013 is one of the top 10 leaders of the NN.
You can vote for them or for someone else in the top 10 to make C.N.N. the leader of the year.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, George Well had seen his sick father come to his senses and faint, going to the hospital, who were not adequately equipped to help them.
Jamel Well, in 1981, a car accident near Cameroon’s capital, Yunde, was injured.
At first they only had a broken hand, but an infection spread to their brain, and he made blood vessels that affected their rest of their lives.
George Well says, "There was no neurosurgery in Cameroon."
If we had money, we would have brought our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Well was taking his father to a large crowd of clinics and hospitals and getting whatever treatment they could get.
He said, “It is not easy.”
You leave this house in the morning at 5:00 a.m. hoping you'll be the first to get to the hospital, but it doesn't.
There's a lot of disease there.
Some will lay hold on death, waiting for it.
The situation has not changed much since Well's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one physician for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
If you compare, there is a physician for every 413 people in the United States.
And though there be among them that are wise men, yet many of the inhabitants of Cameroon can't pay for it.
Two out of five people live below the poverty line in the country, and about two thirds of all the health services in the country.
Well, they say, "They only have a problem with poverty."
Because they are poor, they have no pleasure in their life.
And it came to pass, when he saw the affliction of his father, and of his kindred, that he was determined to satisfy it.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers have cured 700 free blood cells last year.
They themselves became physicians, and began to work as vascular surgeons at the central hospital of jonde.
And they started a non-profit organization that goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical services.
Since 2008, he and a group of his volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday they sit in a van, and up to 30 people, they take supplies from roof to roof, and they go to rural areas where people need treatment.
Sometimes it doesn't even look like them.
They shall push the chariot more than once out of the rivers and from the dust.
But when they arrive, they really have the honor of having princes: the best home that can be presented by music, dance, and community.
There is a real reason to celebrate free medical services in these villages, and well - with their great smiles and endless energy - is included in it.
The next morning, their team starts meeting with hundreds of sick people.
Well said, "We meet 500 people on each trip."
They come about 60 kilometers from the village, and they walk.
All these weeks provide various types of medical services.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, paralysis, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Other people can get a birth certificate -- the need for this document is in school, but many poor families can't afford it.
In the evening, the group simply undergoes surgery with local surgery.
The operation usually takes place at the school's house, town hall or home; after the process, the disease goes to the place of recovery, and makes room for the next person.
The group publishes Sanitation and Sanitation Services in a room that is the generator of the operation, and works up and up in the morning on a weekly basis.
It's a roundabout speed, but village musicians usually help to motivate the group.
Well, he said, "They're playing dramas all night to keep us alive and keep our jobs."
Their people return to the city on Sunday. They are weary, but they are proud of their labor.
This group -- including Cameroon’s medical and foreign medical students -- has treated 700 free blood cells last year, and they know that their help can change the world of those they help.
One person said that he would be able to go back to work because of getting free Hernia shelves.
He said, “The future will be changed to me and my family.”
In addition to running weekly clinics and working as a medical practitioner in the hospital, there are private medical clinics around the Yunde at night.
He said it's their second job that depletes 60% of their non-profit; the rest is filled with private donations.
"I don't know when they're asleep."
They're always in the hospital, or they're trying to make money for their organization, so they can keep doing this.
Students of medicine and nursing, such as O'Mally, who come from the United States and Europe to join the Well campaign, have a practical opportunity that they can never get in their country.
O'Malley said, "In gene medicine, we're helping to capture a tool for Dr. Well or clean up blood clots, in which we're able to get practical experience."
You'll never get the chance to do that as a second-year medical student in America.
Voluntary students usually work for themselves to get to Cameroon, and they often come with donations' medical supplies.
But after the years are come, they shall be filled with the east wind, and with the east wind.
O'Malley says, "There is no doubt that they are heroes."
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon will never end.
For Well, it's almost like a burden, not a burden.
Helping others to live a happy life, fulfilling the promise made to their father, these are things that bring great joy to them.
Well, they say, "I'm so happy to do this."
And I think about my father.
I hope they'll see what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh, to ease their pain.
