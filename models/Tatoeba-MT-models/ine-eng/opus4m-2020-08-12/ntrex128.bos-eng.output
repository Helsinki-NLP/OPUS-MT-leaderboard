Major members of the congregation are concerned about the similarity with "Maptovci"
Some members of the congregation are overwhelmed by the proposal to change their title to "Members of the Velsk Parliament" (MWP).
This was the result of plans to change the name of the assembly in the Velska Parliament.
Members of the congregation throughout the entire political spectrum are concerned that this may become the subject of ridicule.
A Labourer member of the congregation said his group was concerned "because it is rife with Twp and Pwp".
For readers of van Vels: On the big twp means stupid, and pwp means eviction.
A member of the political party assembly, Plaid, said the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and proposed alternative names.
A member of the large conservative party said his group was "open" on the matter of name change, but noted that there is a small difference between the terms MWP and Mapetovac.
In this context, the pronunciation of the word w is similar to the pronunciation of the word in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission currently working on the draft law on the introduction of a change of name said: "The final decision on the descriptions of the title of members of the Assembly will, of course, be made by members themselves."
The rule of the government of Wales, 2017, gave the congregation authority to change the name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public debate on the proposals that resulted in great support for the appointment of the assembly to the Velcian Parliament.
When it comes to the title of members of the assembly, the Commission has given priority to naming members of the Great Parliament or WMP, but MWP has received the most support in the public debate.
Members of the congregation allegedly make alternative proposals, but efforts to reach a consensus could cause headaches to the president of Elin Jones, from which he is expected to submit a draft bill of amendments within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will also include other changes to the way the assembly functions, including rules on the disqualification of members of the assembly and the Commission system plan.
Members of the congregation will have the final opportunity to vote on their name when they discuss the law.
Macedonians go to a referendum on the change of state name
Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to "The Republic of North Macedonia".
The national vote was organised in an effort to resolve a multi-decade dispute with a neighbouring Greece that has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of their northern neighbour represents the adoption of its territory and persistently opposes its demands for membership in the EU and NATO pact.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on name change, said he would not acknowledge the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, consider that changing the name is simply the price they have to pay for membership in the EU and NATO pact.
The bells on St. Martin were silenced as the churches in Harlem fought for survival
"The older people I spoke to say that there were used to be bars and churches at every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"There's no one else today."
He said the disappearance of the bar is understandable.
"People today are different," he said.
"Bars are no longer a quarter-day resident in which people go regularly."
As for the church, he's worried that money from the sale of property won't last as long as the managers expect, "and sooner or later, they'll go back to where they started."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by residential buildings with apartments full of people who won't help keep the rest of the quartz sanctuaries.
"The vast majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and that's why they'll speed up closing these churches because it's unlikely that people who will move into these buildings will become members of these churches."
Both churches built white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's Church ten years later.
The original community of white Methodists moved out in the 1930s.
The black community that served nearby took possession of the building.
St. Martin's Church took over a black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of traders on 125th Street, the main trade street in Harlem, who opposed the employment or promotion of black people.
In 1939, the fire damaged the building, but as Father Johnson’s parishioners made a plan to rebuild it, they ordered an organ.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor to the Church of St. Martin, proudly called the "poor bells".
The expert who played the organ in July called them "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
Professor Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also pointed out that these were the first organ in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger organ in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's Church didn't find a replacement for him.
What took place in St. Martin's Church over the past few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom were brought by church leaders, and others by the bishop bishops.
The bishop's administration – the bishop's administrative body, composed of church leaders – wrote the bishop in July expressing concern that the bishop would "try to transfer expenses" to the bishop's administration, although the bishop's administration was not included in the rental of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the bishop.
Some parishioners complained about a lack of transparency in the work of the bishop.
The shark injured a 13-year-old in hunting for lobsters in California
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while hunting for lobsters in California on the day of opening hunting for lobsters, officials reported.
Something happened seven hours ago next to the beach Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB TV in San Diego that on Saturday with his friends he dived around half an hour when he heard the boy calling for help and then drove him and the group and helped him get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was an excitement about catching the lobster, but then he "understanded that he was shouting, 'She bit me!'
She bit me!'
"Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
"I called everyone out of the water, 'The shark is in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy is transferred by a helicopter to the Paediatric Hospital of Radi's where his condition is run as critical.
It's not known what kind of shark attacked him.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, told the media that the shark had already been spotted in that area several weeks earlier, but that it was found not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the body.
Officials have closed access to the beach from the beach Ponto Beach in Casablanca to the beach Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 types of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the beauty market in Britain
Sainsbury's becomes a competition for chains of Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams to separate cosmetic products in the style of shop houses where professional assistants work.
As part of a significant market transition to the beauty market in Britain worth 2.8 billion pounds, which is growing as sales on fashion markets and household equipment declines, larger cosmetics units will be tested at 11 stores across the country, and will be expanded to more shops next year if they succeed.
Investment in cosmetic products comes from the fact that supermarkets find ways to use the shelves that have been used for televisions, microwaves and household equipment.
Sainsbury's said it would double its cosmetic assortment by offering more than 3,000 products, including brand products such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of brand products L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space in departments similar to those in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket will also relaunch its Boutique finish line by making most of the products suitable for vegans – something that is increasingly looking for younger customers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume shop will test the place of sale in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which was opened in Croydon, South London, last week, and the second will open in Selly Oak in Birmingham, later this year.
The purchase on the network and the movement to daily purchase of smaller quantities of food in local stores means that supermarkets need to make additional efforts to attract people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of the Sainsbury's chain, said the shops would look more and more like a grocery store in the supermarket's efforts to reverse the shock of the Aldi and Lidl chains, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's opened the Argos store departments in hundreds of its shops, and also introduced and Habitat departments since they bought both chains two years ago, which says it increased the sales of food products and the profitability of the purchase.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to modernise its departments of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals has ended unfavorably.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with the Boots chain in the early 2000s, but this partnership ended up fighting about sharing the income from the pharmacy in their stores.
The new strategy came into force three years ago after Sainsbury's sold his 281 pharmacy to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain for 125 million pounds.
Lloyds was told to play a role in this plan by adding an additional line of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of the Sainsbury's chain, said: "We have transformed the look and experience of our beauty departments to give our customers a more pleasant environment.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be able to provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and practical locations mean that we are now an indispensable destination of the beauty market that sets new standards in relation to the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "fighting" after Holly Willoughby withdrew from a $11 million deal
The Dragons Dan star, Peter Jones, is "hungry" after the TV director Holly Willoughby withdrew from the deal with his personal brand worth 11 million pounds to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand of home and additional equipment, Truly.
The company of this pair is compared to the Goop Gwynet Paltrow brand.
This morning's show director (37) announced her departure via Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered the Dragons' Den Peter Jones show star by withdrawing from their profitable brand at the last minute – to focus on its new entry contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources said Jones was "hungry" when a golden girl admitted to television, during a tense meeting Tuesday in the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, in the area of Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to £1.5 million, meant that there was no longer time to spend on their brand of household and additional equipment Truly.
The company was compared to Gwynet Paltrow Goop and was expected to double Willoughby's wealth estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby (37) on Instagram announced her departure, Jones flew from Britain to one of his weekends.
The source said, "Holly put Truly at the top of her priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term plan to secure her earnings over the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw has made everything involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday was so close to launch.
In the Marlow headquarters there is a lot of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the head of this morning's show, which was among the most profitable British stars, could cost the company millions for massive investments in a wide range of products, from pillows and candles to clothing and household equipment, and possible additional delays in the launch date.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tari Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cappov in 2016, and Jones (52) joined the company in March.
Couples go on vacation together and Jones has 40 percent share in Baldwin's production house.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand's ambassador and replace Anta McPartlin as the leader of the ITV show I'm A Celebrity.
Source near Jones said last night, "We wouldn't comment on his business."
Hard words, 'and then we fell in love.'
He joked about the criticism he might get from the media because of a comment that could be characterized as "unpresiding" and because of a positive stance on the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump drop so much?
Trump said with his funny voice, "the news reader."
"I didn't give up at all."
He pointed out that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump announced their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step forward to denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearization have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, high North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders and the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "adequate response" by the US to the original steps of North Korea to disarmament.
Instead, he pointed out, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump gave a much more positive opinion during his speech at the meeting.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We've been on the move since the war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to repair his relationship with Kim have brought positive results - by suspending missile testing, releasing hostages and returning the dead remains of US soldiers.
And he stood in defense of his unusual approach to talks with Kim.
"It's easy to act presidentially, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to enter this full arena, we'd have about 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the world in front of him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia destroyed the island by killing hundreds
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs have been told that their assistance is not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of the island of Lombok has been relocated, the state of national disaster has not been declared, which is a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not seek international assistance, so it will be quite difficult," Mrs. Sumbung said.
While the Save the Children is making up a team to travel to Pala, it is still not sure if foreign personnel can work on the field.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson of the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation on the island of Pala in order to see whether international agencies should be allowed to participate in the provision of assistance.
In view of the constant earthquake in Indonesia, it is regrettable how much this country is ready for the wrath of nature.
Although the shelters behind the tsunamis are built in Aceh, they are not often seen on other parts of the coast.
Apparently there was no siren after the tsunamis on the island of Pala, although the warning was in force, so it also contributed to the loss of life.
And under ideal conditions, travel between many Indonesian islands presents a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The hospital ship located in Lombok to help the victims of the earthquake is on their way to Pala, but it will take him at least three days to reach the scene of a new accident.
President Yoko Widodo focused his campaign on improving Indonesian long-term infrastructure and did not save money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has hit Mr. Yoko's administration while the following year is expecting new elections.
Mr. Yoko is also under pressure from long-term sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people have lost their lives, and tens of thousands have been displaced because of the street struggles of Christian and Muslim groups, who used swords, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Footballer Liverpool Daniel Sturridge has inserted a deep balancing hit against the Chelsea Football Club
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing in the Premier League by hitting 89 minutes on Saturday at the Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri at about 30 yards from Chelsea's naked club while his team lost 1 0.
He moved the ball to his left side and then pushed it to the outside station.
The ball flew high above the penal area, turning to the top right corner of the net.
She finally fell over Kep Arizabalga, who was in the jump and got into the net.
"It was just to position, to receive the ball, and players like Shaq always go ahead as much as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time," Sturrudge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I touched her once and I didn't think much, I just hit the ball."
Chelsea ran 1-0 in half-time after the Belgian star Eden Hazard hit 25 minutes.
In the fifth attack, the blue attacker added the ball to Mateo Kovacic before running from the middle of the field to Liverpool.
The coin touched quickly and brought back the ball in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful cross, pointing Hazard into the prison.
Hazard was faster than defense and ended up near the station by putting his left leg in a net outside Liverpool Alison Becker.

The number of Indonesian tsunami victims reached 832
The number of victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, the state disaster agency said early Sunday.
A large number of people in ruins of the building were reported crashing the 7.5 earthquake that took place on Friday and raised the waves high and up to 20 feet, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Pala, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered by the remains of damaged buildings.
Police arrested a man (32) after the woman was killed
A murder investigation was conducted after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
Forty-four-year-old girl was found stabbed at 7:55 in Grayson Mews in the morning at John Street, and a 30-year-old man was arrested suspected of murder.
The police have called people who have seen or heard anything to answer.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is in the early stages, but I'm calling everyone near John Street Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious about contacting us.
I would also like to invite all, especially the taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the car control panels, to contact us because they may have information that is important for the investigation."
Police spokesperson confirmed that the woman whose body was found in Birkenhead and found in the house.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman came to the front of the room to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and the police said they were in the process of informing the victim's family.
The taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police informed him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was left without a text when he found out what happened.
The residents are now told that they will have to wait hours before they are allowed to return.
They heard a cop tell a man that the whole area is considered a crime scene.
One woman came to the crime scene in tears.
She said, "This is so terrible."

A large number of police officers were inside the police cordon monitoring the residential building.
All who have any information are invited to directly contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact the Crimestoppers line at 0800 555 111, indicating the case 247 of September 30.
Statue Cromwell in parliament became the newest monument in the middle of a "review of history" dispute
Its removal would represent a poetic justice due to the destruction of numerous cultural and religious artifacts in England that his Puritan followers carried out in the Taliban manner.
But Cromwell Society's proposal, Mr. Crick, described as "crazy" and "trying to revise history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate on the abolition of the statue, it was inevitable that the character of Oliver Cromwell in front of the palace in Westminster would also become a target.
Cromwell didn't even order, he didn't even run an iconography during the English civil wars.
Wrong Cromwell could be sacrificed for the work of his ancestor Thomas of the previous century.
The magnificent display of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of an opinion from the nineteenth century and part of the character's history that many still believe should be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith said about The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more late in the nineteenth century than today, to be the guardian of parliament from outside pressure, in his case the monarchy.
Is this entirely the subject of a permanent historical debate?
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the seventeenth century has shaped the further development of our nation and that Cromwell is a recognizable character that represents one side of that division.
His achievements in the Lord of Protectors are also worthy of glory and mention."
The killer's pig has been killed by a Chinese farmer
The pig attacked and killed farmers on the Southwestern China market, local media reported.
A man, known only to be Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered with blood in a pig in a market in the town of Liupanshu in Guizhou area, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
Pigs prepared to inject the vaccine into pigs in the pighouse on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the Qinghai area of China.
He allegedly traveled with a relative from nearby Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of the neighbor's pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pig's mouth with blood around his mouth.
The forensic investigation confirmed that the pig weighed 550 pounds and killed the farmer, as reported.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and torn apart," said a cousin who introduced himself as Wu, conveys Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage shows Yuan who came to the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked to prevent the attack on other people while the police collected evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market owners allegedly negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of swine attacks on humans have been reported earlier.
The pig attacked a woman and her husband in 2016 at their farm in Massachusetts, killing a man.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 650 pounds had kissed a big farmer with his tractor until his wife had scared and driven away.
After the pigs ate an Oregon farmer in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told the CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as "a trigger".
"They're just playing.
They like stabbing, they're very curious... they don't intend to hurt you.
You just have to respect them enough," he said.
The remains of the rose hurricane bring widespread floods to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa has weakened moving above the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring floodwaters due to floods across northern Mexico and in the southwest of the United States in the next few days.
Rosini's storms of the first category reached the speed of 85 miles per hour from five o'clock in the morning to the east on Sunday, and was 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, I form in the Pacific and move to the east and west coast of the United States. As the tropical rainstorm of Rosa approaches the island of Baja California on Monday, it will start pushing tropical moisture north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring about 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical humidity together with the rising tide will create widespread rainfall in the southwest in the next few days.
Locally 1 to 4 inches of rain will result in floods, floods, and possible landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity will result in falls that will locally reach 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in the parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
Even 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Floods are possible as a result of a sudden deterioration of weather conditions and typical rainfall.
Walking in the desert would be extremely unthinking with the danger of tropical rains.
The abundant rains in the canyons could result in wild rivers and thunderstorms with locally strong winds and sandstorms.
As I arrive, I will bring the local pluices on the southern coast of California.
It is possible to have total rainfall of more than half an inch, which could cause nanos and skating Augustes.
This will be the first wet season rain in the region.
The room-split tropical rain will reach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread later on Monday and Tuesday.
The rains will reach the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue all Wednesday.
In October, large fluctuations of temperatures across the United States may occur as the Arctic is getting colder, and the tropicals are still quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes in short-dispersal.
There is an excellent example of the dramatic difference in temperature in the Central United States on Sunday.
The difference in temperatures in Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St Louis and Des Moins, Iowa, was almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, summer heat remains will again try to buy and expand.
At the beginning of October, it will be heated in most central and eastern parts of the United States with temperatures from about 80 degrees from the south-east to the north-east.
The temperature in New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term weather forecast announces a high potential temperature above average in the Eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people saw an exciting testimony by Brett Kavanaugh before the High Court on Thursday, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political resistance continues, with issuers interrupting regular broadcasts due to the latest complexity on Friday: an agreement made by Senator Arizona Jeff Blake with the FBI on a one-week prosecution.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Commission that a hundred percent was sure that attaching Kavanaugh touched and tried to unwind at the high school party.
In a passionate history, Kavanaugh said that a hundred percent sure it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, this probably looked at more than 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company has been computing CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channel viewers.
Numbers were not immediately available for other networks that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network channels.
And Nielsen's usually having trouble getting people to follow the transfer from the office.
To get better acquainted, it's a public like the one who's following football elimination matches or Oscar's assignment.
Fox News Channel, whose editors supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led in front of other networks with an average number of viewers of 5.69 million during the day hearing, said from Nielsen.
ABC was the second of 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest is high and after hearing.
Flake was the central character of the drama on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS network cameras recorded the footage of the protestors who shouted at him after he tried to enter the elevator to attend the hearing of the judicial commission.
He stood down looking for a few minutes while he was being insulted, with live transmission to CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have power while so many women are weak."
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, that there was more to say at the commission hearing.
Cable and television networks had live transmission hours later while the judicial commission voted to pass the appointment of Kavanaugh Senate to the vote.
But Flake said he would do it only on condition that the FBI investigates charges against the so-called next week, to which the minority of Democrats are calling.
Flakea was partly convinced of talks with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few more senators after that, Flake decided.
Flake's choice was significant because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "playing politics" about Brexit
Prime Minister Theres May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union to "play politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interests in the Sunday Times interview.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a conservative party conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview up to her headline, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying it was a proposal that Britain and the EU take customs from each other "very absurd".
The murder of Waydea Sims: Police arrested Ditheon Simpson, the LSU player's death suspect
Police arrested a suspect in a deadly shooting that killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the LSU.
Diteon Simpson (20) was arrested and imprisoned under the charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Officials posted a video recording of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Simpson lost his glasses during the fight.
The police took glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, the WAFB channel reports CBS.
After Simpson's investigation, the police said he confessed to killing Wayde.
His bail is $350,000, the lawyer said.
Baton Rouge's Eastern Mortgage issued a preliminary report on Friday, saying that the cause of death was gunshots in the head and neck.
The department said the merits belong to the police working group for the refugees of Louisiana, the criminalist state police lab, the Southern University police and the authorities who helped during the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's sports club director Joe Alleva thanked the district agency for implementing the law on "fearfulness and desire for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
A 6-foot and 6-inch attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also a basketball player at the LSU Club.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 leaps per match.
On Friday morning, the basketball coach of the LSU Will Wade club said the team was "depressed" and "in shock" because of Wayde's death.
"This is what we're always worried about," Wade said.
Volcano throws ashes through Mexico City
The ashes that bloomed from the Volcano Popocatepetl have reached the southern quarters of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Protection Centre warned the Mexicans on Sunday to stay at a safe distance after volcanic activity in the crater increased and after 183 emissions of gas and ashes were registered at 24 hours.
The center was tracking more earthquakes and beatings.
Pictures on social media show a thin layer of ash covering wind cars in the neighborhoods of Mexico City like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increased activity of a volcano located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since the 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists in the eyes of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona Sunday after protestors, supporters of independence, clashed with a special police mission, when thousands of people joined counter-demonstrations on marking the annual polarising Catalan poll on kidnapping.
A group of masked separatists, detained by a special police station, threw them with eggs and dust colors, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually full of tourists.
Later in the day, he was beaten and beaten by a police officer who used his pendants to fight.
Independence supporters have been scanning "No forgetfulness, No Forgiveness" for several hours and have been struggling with Union supporters who have called "Live Spain".
Fourteen people received medical treatment for minor injuries they suffered in protests, the local press reported.
Trends are still high in the region, which was defined for independence a year after the referendum of the first October that Madrid declared illegal, but which Catalan separatists celebrate.
The voters chose independence by a vast majority, although the outcome was low because the anti-circumvention opponents boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting on violent conflicts across the region.
Groups defending independence camped on Friday night to prevent demonstrations and provide support to the national police.
The demonstrations were still held, but they changed the route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who participated in separatist protests with his wife, said he is no longer optimistic about Catalan independence.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out of happiness because they were allowed to vote, but now we're in a joke," he said.
Although they took a key but intense victory in the local elections last December, the Catalan parties that are betting on independence have had difficulty keeping track because some of their most famous leaders are in self-defence or detention, awaiting trial because of their role in the organisation of the referendum and then declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 40-year-old auto mechanic who was recording a police support protest on the phone, said politicians on both sides were supporting the conflict.
"It's getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders detained since the end of last year, announced his candidacy in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Deputy in European elections is the best way to condemn the backward democratic values and repression imposed on us by the Spanish authorities," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after being killed by a car in the house
Three men (33, 34 and 39) were arrested after being killed several times by a car in a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent Street on Thursday around 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate was damaged as well as the building itself.
There's a chance that at one point the car was shot out of a single shot.
Menge's hit on Livingstone brought a victory from 1:0 against Rangers.
The first goal of Dolly Menge was to secure a victory for Livingston
The advanced Livingston surprised the Rangers and recorded only another loss for Steven Gerrard in 18 Ibrox matches.
The goal of Dolly Menge was key, while Gary Holt's club was aligned with the hibernian in another place.
Gerrard's club didn't record any victory in the Premier League guests this season and will play against the first-placed Hearts behind which eight points will be left next week.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid from Vienna in a European League match on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended a series of matches in the league to six matches, and coach Holt has not yet experienced defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed the opportunity against a missing guest
Holt's team was supposed to be in charge a long time before they scored a goal because their direct game was very problematic for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson got through, but his attempt went past the goal, and then Alan Lithgrow's attempt went past the goal after he slipped to get the ball that Craig Halkett had turned into the goal.
It was up to the hosts to allow the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could create problems for guests from free beatings.
And that's how a key goal has been achieved.
He was sentenced to a free blow against Rangers, Livingston made a pass, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created an opportunity for Manga, who took the ball and hit it from the middle of the criminal space.
So far, the Rangers have dominated the game, but the host's defense remained unprovoked and the goalman Liam Kelly didn't have much trouble.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Kelly had to intervene because of Alfred Morelos.
Scott Pittman stopped the foot of Rangers Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot too wide from another free shot for Livingston.
The Croissians have repeatedly arrived in Livingston's penal area and have been constantly defended, while the two penances they were looking for – one after the faul against the replacement player Glenn Middleton, and the other because of the game – have not been allocated.
"The Phenomenal Game" by Livingstone – Analysis
BBC journalist Scotland, Alaskar Lamont is in Tony Macaroni arena
The phenomenal game and the result of Livingstone.
Everyone up to one was great and they're continuing to exceed expectations on the way out.
Their game style and players almost haven't changed since their return to the top, but the big rewards belong to Holta who gives the energy to the team since their arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, leading a great organized defense, until Menga was given peace through the entire sword to Connor Goldson and Joe Worral.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were under Gerard's stick from time to time, they didn't reach that level.
There were no final hits – only one time they broke through the host lines – and this is a kind of wake-up call for Rangers in the middle of the table.
Mixed reception for Erdogan in Kelna
Saturday (September 29th) was a sign of a smile and blue sky while the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan Germany, whose aim is to improve NATO's relations with the ally.
They have been divided on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to open up a huge new mosque.
This is the city where Turkey's largest number of Turkish people live.
Police have imposed security measures as a reason to block the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many supporters have gathered near to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors who opposed Erdogan – many of them the Kurds – were also loud, condemning Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Double protests reflect a division in the views of a guest some German Turks celebrate as heroes, while others condemn him for being an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Cycling killed in a car crash
The biker died in a car crash in London.
There was a meeting near the intersection of Beswood Street and Evelyn Street, on the road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, about 10:15 after British weather.
The car driver stopped and intervened on the emergency team, but the man died on the spot.
The crash took place a few months after another biker died in an accident in which the driver left the crash site, on the street of Children Street, which is about a mile away from the scene of the Saturday accident.
London police said they were working on identifying the victim and informing the family.
The streets are closed, the buses are redirected, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six employees injured in accidents
Six prison officials were injured in high-security riots in prison for men, the Prison Office said.
The riots broke out in Long Lartin, Worcestershire, Sunday around 9:30 a.m., British time, and they're still going on.
He was invited by a special staff member named "Tornado" to calm down the nerds in which eight guards were involved in one wing of the prison.
Officials have suffered less facial injuries and help has been given to them on the spot
The prison administration spokesperson said: "We have arranged specially trained prison personnel dealing with an incident that is ongoing in Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members have received medical assistance for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we have made it clear that the police will be responsible for this and that they could be extended to prison sentences."
Long Lartin prison has placed more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the state.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was admitted to hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, a special squad was called into prison for serious incidents where personnel were attacked by billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Late City (which can be of use in areas affected by drought)
Rarely when tropical depression hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen at the beginning of the next week while Hurricane Rosa goes through her remaining energy through the desert southwest, carrying with her the risk of flooding.
The National Meteorological Administration has already issued flood warnings on Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona and South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly across Phoenix on Tuesday, and her approach will announce the rain on Monday night.
The National Meteorological Administration in Phoenix tweeted that only "ten tropical cyclones since 1950 had maintained the status of tropical storms or depression around 200 miles around Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) is a hurricane that was 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest projections of the National Hurricane Centre predict 2 to 4 inches of precipitation and in isolated parts of Mogollon Rome in Arizona and up to 6 inches.
In other parts of the southwest desert, including the central part of the Rockies and Great Basin chain, there will most likely be 1 to 2 inches, and possibly up to 4 inches in isolated parts.
In areas where there is no fear of floods, the rain of Rossa could be a blessing because the area is hit by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, one part of these falls will probably be useful because the southwest is currently hit by drought.
According to the U.S. drought control agency, little more than 40 per cent of Arizona was hit in the least by extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com said.
First, on his way, Hurricane Ross will lead to a crossroads on the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, who will still have the power of hurricanes 85 miles an hour on Sunday morning, will be 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will move at a speed of 12 miles an hour.
The storm will reach the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean, and that's why it's going to start raining.
Therefore, it is expected to hit Mexico with the force of tropical storms on Monday afternoon or at night.
Plums in parts of Mexico could be very strong and could pose a major risk of flooding.
"The total rainfall from three to six inches is expected from Baj California to the northwest Sonora, and perhaps even up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Then Rosa will head north across Mexico with the strength of tropical storms before coming to Arizona early in the morning in the form of tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and South Utah on Tuesday evening.
"The main danger expected from Rose or her remains are the large pluices in Baja California, the northwest Sonora and the American southwest desert," the National Centre for hurricanes said.
It is expected that these pluices will cause stormy floods of life and floods in the deserts, as well as cliffs in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a sixteen-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
Teenagers found injured near the Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday about 4 a.m. after British time.
He's taken to the hospital and he's in stable condition.
Seventeen-year-olds, two eighteen-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset said.
Officials are calling for those who have any video events on their mobile phone.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the humiliation and anger" of a democratic party
"Voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the cruel and disrespectful tactics of a democratic party," Trump said at a meeting in Whelling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the humiliation and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the claim of Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted several decades ago while he was a teenager.
Ford also testified to hearing his charges.
The president said on Saturday that "the Americans saw the glory, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"Voice to confirm judge Kavanaugh is the vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a lawyer with great achievements in public service," said a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president touched directly on the appointment of Kavanaugh as he spoke about the significance of the Republican elections in the middle of the mandate.
"Five weeks of the most important choices in our lives.
Although I'm not running personally, I'm actually running," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump claims democracy is trying to "resist and interfere".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected not later than Friday, a senior member of the Republican Party for the CNN said.
Hundreds have lost their lives in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to increase
At least 384 people died, many of them collected by huge waves that hit the beaches, when the great earthquakes and tsunamis hit the island of Sulawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered because of the festival on the beach in the city of Pala on Friday, when waves hit the shore in the summer, bringing many to death and destroying everything they found their way to.
Cunami followed the earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the threat of tsunami was announced yesterday, people were still dealing with their business on the beach and did not escape immediately, and died," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian disaster repair agency, turning to Jakarta.
"Cunami didn't come alone, carried cars, balloons, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled over the open sea 800 km per hour (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coast.
Some people went up to the trees and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 centers in the city of Pala.
Air photos, issued by the disaster agency, show a multitude of destroyed buildings and shops, curved and damaged bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The raids continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series hit an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said that the energy of the huge earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb dropped at Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geographical position of the city, located on the edge of the long, narrow bay, increased the power of tsunamis, they said.
He described the damage as "absolute" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of several victims were found under the ruins of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 disappeared.
Nugroho said that victims and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in the area of Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
The communications "were completely cut off without any information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live here," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that their personnel and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get even worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was strongly criticized for not reporting that it hit Pala with tsunamis, although officials said waves arrived at the time the warning was issued.
Amateur records distributed on social networks show a man on the top floor who warns people on the street below panicking about the coming tsunamis.
Within a few minutes the water wall hit the shore, carrying with it buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't verify the authenticity of the video immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunamis have caused the disappearance of electricity that has cut off communications around Palu, exacerbating the saving efforts of the authorities.
The military began sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities with humanitarian help, the authorities said, but the evacueans still need food and other basic necessities.
The city airport is only reopened for humanitarian flights and will be closed by October.
President Yoko Widodo scheduled a visit to the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of Indonesian tsunami victims has risen to over 800.
It's very bad.
Although World Vision staff must have arrived from Dongala in Pala, where the employees were located in tents raised in the office hall, they testified to the sights of destruction on the road, Mr. Doseb said.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups began to take the first steps to mitigate the disaster, there was a complaint that foreign highly qualified humanitarian workers were not allowed to travel to the Pala.
According to Indonesian regulations, the flow of foreign funds, supplies and people are only possible if the site is declared to be a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster of the territorial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says 'all right, this is a national disaster', we'll be open to international help, but that status hasn't yet been declared."
While the second night of earthquakes and tsunamis falls on Pala, friends and families of the missing still hope that their loved ones will be miraculously saved and that their earthquake story in this natural disaster will be mitigated.
On Saturday, the boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped for two days under the rubble next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, a Indonesian paragliding team coach, trained two missing paragliders in front of the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The other prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagija, were his disciples.
"As an older member of the paragliding team I bear my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon remembers that hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel spread to the umbrella circles he desperately sent whatsApp messages to the contestants at Palu who participated in the festival on the beach.
However, his messages had only one grey hook, instead of two blue hooks.
"I think that means messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves took 26,750 dollars while filling ATMs in the Newport complex on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from workers of Brink who filled a ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a police report.
The car driver emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man ran behind Brin's employee and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be delivered.
Witnesses saw more suspects running off the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
All those who have any information on their identity should contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Reper renames to Ye
Reper Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
After announcing a change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "It will be previously known as Kanye West."
West (41) has been known for some time as Ye and has used the title for his eighth album, which was published in June.
There was a change before his show on Saturday Night Live, where his new album Yandhi is expected to be promoted.
He replaced the singer Ariana Grande who cancelled the performance for "emotional reasons," the emission author said.
With regard to the shortcut of his current professional name, the West said earlier that this word had religious significance for him.
"I believe that 'yes' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year as he discussed the title of the album with the radio director Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm you, it's us.
It came from Kanye, which means the only, only Ye – which is the reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of what we are."
He's one of the many famous repertoires that changed their name.
Sean Combs was known under the names of Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he published that he preferred the names of Love and Brother Love.
Former West co-worker, JAY-Z, also used versions with or without drawings and capital letters.
AMLO in Mexico swore not to use the army against the civilian
The elected president of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore that he would never use military force against civilians as the country approached the fiftieth anniversary of revenge against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday that "he will never use the army to obey the Mexican people".
The military shot peaceful demonstrations on the market on October 2, 1968, killing even 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to provide support to young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunity to educate young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double the funding of artificial intelligence
As China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount spent on research in this field, the investor and art engineer Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said.
Comments arrived after various parts of the American authorities issued artificial intelligence publications, although the United States generally does not have an official strategy in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: their goal is to be the first in the field of innovation of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A double artificial intelligence budget would be a good start, considering that all the other countries are far behind the United States, and we are looking for a new breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
Double funds could double the chances that much progress will be made in the field of artificial intelligence in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the executive director of the company Synovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most outstanding art intelligence companies, Face++.
He worked at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s on an artificial intelligence system that proved to be superior to the top-ranking American Othello player, and later he was executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee admitted to earlier US government technology competitions such as Robotics Challenge Agency for Advanced Defense Research Projects and asked when they planned the next competitions that could identify future visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to make enormous efforts to get government subsidies, Lee said.
"It doesn't take China's academic leaders away, that's what corporations do," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recently hired brilliant individuals from the university to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policies could also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctors in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued its plan to develop the artificial intelligence of the new generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences grants grants to people in academic institutions in a similar way that the National Scientific Foundation and other government organisations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year in the United States, the Defence Department formed a Joint Intelligence Centre that seeks to include partners from the industry and the academic community, and the White House announced the formation of the Electoral Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of two billion dollars for an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the National Scientific Foundation is concerned, it currently invests over $100 million a year in researching artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, American legislation that has been attempting to form the Commission's national security for artificial intelligence does nothing for months.
Macedonians voting on a referendum on the change of state name
Macedonian citizens voted on Sunday's referendum to change the country's name to "The Republic of North Macedonia", a step that would resolve a multi-decade dispute with Greece that blocked their membership in the European Union and NATO alliance.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour represents the occupation of its territory and vetoed their entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement on the proposed name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that this could endanger the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign raised a question as to whether the referendum would result in a minimum of 50 per cent of what it took to make the referendum valid.
The question on the ballot was, "Are you a member of NATO and the EU with the agreement with Greece?"
Actors of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, claim that this is the price Macedonia, one of the countries created by the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth paying for entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they could live freely within the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said Oliver Georgievska (79) in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament said they would be guided by the result of the vote and the result would be decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament would be needed to change the name.
The state electoral commission stated that there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the outcome was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when a total of 66 per cent of voters came out.
"I came to vote for my children, we belong in Europe," said José Tanevski (62), a voter in Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško voted in Macedonia's name change referendum, which could pave the way for them to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30th 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) prepared a small bin and dragged the chairs in front of the tent that were torn apart by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads up, not at the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are poor, but a proud country.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian community."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring much-needed investment in Macedonia whose unemployment rate is more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that a large majority will vote 'for' because it is more than 80 per cent of our population for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after inserting the leaflets.
He said the "for" result would be "the confirmation of our future."
The poll published on Monday at the Macedonian Institute for Political Research says that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum – which is below the required output.
According to another survey conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they'd vote for.
In order to be successful, the referendum requires a 50 per cent exit plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the Western government since it came to power last May.
Look: player Manchester City Sergio Aguero passes through the entire Brigton defense and achieves goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling have resolved Brigton's defenses in a victory of 2:0 Manchester City against Brighton at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed very easy when Aguero scored in 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker took the ball in the middle of the field at the start of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defense players before he found himself in the open field.
Aguera then surrounded three green dresses.
He pushed himself around a defense player and was faster than a few more on Brighton's naked edge.
Then he added to the left, finding Sterling.
The English attacker took advantage of his first hit in the penal area to return the ball to Agueru, who was right-handedly taking control of the golman Brighton Matthew Ryan by hitting the right-hand side of the net.
"Aguero had some foot problems," coach Pep Guardio told reporters.
"We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what it was.
We're happy he scored the goal at that point."
But Sterling was the one who gave the aliens an initial advantage in the Prime Minister's puzzle.
He scored a goal in the 29th minute.
In that action, Aguero received the ball deep into Brighton's part of the field.
He added Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane touched it a few times before sending Sterling to the naked.
The celestial attacker threw the ball into the net before he slipped out of the field.
The city is fighting Hoffenheim in the group phase of the League of Champions at 12:55 on Thursday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a game without a match against Rockies
Since the Nationals was eliminated in the elimination game, there was no reason to insist on another party.
But the contestant Scherzer hopes he'll take a stand Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have the advantage of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, are still in the upgrade.
Rockies at least have a direct pass for a 5:2 victory against the Nationals on Friday, but they're still trying to win the first title in the league.
"Although we're not playing for anything, at least we can get out of the field knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with fans and other teams will probably be at the highest level compared to all the other this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in these conditions?"
Nationals still need to publish the initial team for Sunday, but they're allegedly willing to let Scherzer throw in that situation.
Scherzer, who would have been the 34th time to start the game, trained on Thursday and will throw on Sunday when he's usually resting.
The Washington right leads 18:7 this season on average worth 2.53, 300 standings in 220 2/3 inings.
Trump held a meeting in West Virginia
The president briefly referred to the situation regarding the election of his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke about the importance of the Republican elections in half the mandate.
"All we've done will be on the dice in November.
We're five weeks from the most important choices in our lives.
These are one of the big, big – although I haven't actually run for a candidate because I fight everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump went on, "See these terrible, terrible groups of radical democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to return power using all possible ways, see evil, dirty games.
Do not be concerned about anyone who is going to harm him, and whoever is going to overcome him in order that they may gain power and control. Indeed, they will have whatever they desire, and We will not give them that which We have not given them.
Democrats, he said, are on the resistance and interference mission.
"And you've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "angrily, evil, evil and dishonest."
He mentioned a democratic senator and a member of the Senate Judicial Commission, Diana Feinstein, on behalf of which the public was led to a loud dissatisfaction.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document in public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, I'm waiting. That's the worst language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party no longer accepts different positions.
It is intolerant to those who express their opinion
When the Momentum activists in my local district voted to censor me, I was not surprised at all.
Besides, I am the last in a number of Labour Members of Parliament who have been told not to welcome, and all because we have expressed our opinion.
My colleague in the parliament Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censors criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corby.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, and ironically, these are similar problems that Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
An announcement from a meeting of the Labour Party's circuit in Nottingham East held on Friday, "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During the eight years I spent as a local Labour member of parliament, Friday night meetings were mostly just that.
Unfortunately, the tone of many meetings today is not the same and the promise of " nicer, gentler" policy has long been forgotten, and the question is whether it has ever been.
It has become increasingly evident that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the Party's leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when my colleagues whom I believed to share similar political positions began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and take positions that I would never otherwise agree with, whether it was national security or the single market of the European Union.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn't matter what I say – it's accompanied by a riot of social networks, calls for removal from the party, central policy convictions and tell me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And that doesn't just happen to me.
On the contrary, I know that I am happier than some of my colleagues because comments have been directed to me mainly by political nature.
I'm amazed at the professionalism and determination of my colleague who's everyday dealing with a bunch of sexist or racist insults, but he's not retreating.
Something that disappointed me most at this political time was how these levels of insult became normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should look after the culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different attitudes and with every voice of distrust or change of the rules of the party selection is being narrowed down.
I've got a lot of advice and for the last two years, they've been telling me to raise my head, I'll be less loud and then I'll be okay.
But that's why I didn't get into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, provoked by the failure of Prime Minister Thatcher's government, which literally destroyed my primary school student, I have struggled to assume that better public services for those who are most needed, either as a local councillor or as a minister in the government.
I've never hidden my policy, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused by my political stances and areas of disagreement with the current management.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would suggest that, when the country rushes to Brexit that will endanger the households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand why someone would waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the main message I have is not addressed to the Momentum in Nottingham, but to the voters in my election unit, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that the threat of removing me from the party or political smiles will not prevent me from acting in the way I think it is in the best interests of all of you.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose — Father’s Undeserved Kindness
Two late attempts may have distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Air has won a deserved victory in this exciting day's game at Tennant's Prime Minister League.
Now they're at the top of the table, the only unbeatable of ten teams.
In the end, the home team won the victory thanks to the superior defense, as well as the greater number of opportunities used, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to be pleased.
"We've been tested in the games so far and we're still unbeatable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayru all honor, they have taken advantage of their opportunities better than we have."
The attempt by Grant Naderson in the 14th minute that turned Frazier Climo, gave the advantage to Airy, but it was a yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, whom the Warriors let play, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical advantage and Jason Baggot caught an unconverted attempt.
Climus penalized increased Ayra's leadership before, just before half-time, he achieved a solo attempt to score from 17:5 to Ayr in half-time.
But Melrose started well in the second half and tried Patrick Anderson, who turned Baggot into a five-point leader.
Then there was a long interruption due to the serious injury by Ruaridh Knott, who was brought out on the carrier, and Ayr continued to increase the advantage of the attempt by Stafford McDowall, who had transformed the Climo.
Captain Ayra's deputy, Blair Macpherson, then got the yellow card, and Melrose again took advantage of the numerous overpowering effort of Bruce Colvin, after a period of intense pressure.
However, the hosts recovered and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow card due to the fall over the Clim without a ball. MacPherson reached a touch down from the penal line behind Ayra's upcoming mole.
Climo turned, as he did almost from the beginning of the sequel, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's hit into the prison and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth attempt by the host.
The Still game series star prepares for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kieran, a star in the Still game series, prepares to move to the host industry after learning that he was appointed director of the company of licensed restaurants.
Fifty-six-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in a popular BBC series that he writes about and plays together with his long-time partner in comedy, Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the future of the ninth season would be the last in the series and Kiernan seems to be planning life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of the company Arifingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the news, although the source of Scottish Sun's journal revealed that Kiernan wanted to join the "growing restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, which has no way out of the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol the Marine Headquarters in La Paz.
There are ocean-floating flags in public buildings.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are lined with slogans: "We have the right to the sea.
Returning to the sea is our duty."
Throughout the land of Bolivia, there is still a strong memory of the shore they lost in Chile's use of in the bloody slaughter of natural resources in the nineteenth century – as well as the desire to resuscitate the Pacific.
These hopes may be the greatest in the last few decades while Bolivia expects the International Court of Justice's judgment of October 1st after five years of council.
"Bolivia has caught a flight, in the spirit of unity and virtue, and of course expects a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the verdict of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will judge for the benefit of Bolivia and claim that, after a decade of heated negotiations, Chile must agree to negotiations on the granting of Bolivia's sovereign sea exit.
Here's Morales, a charismatic Bolivian president of indigenous origin, who faces a controversial fight for a re-election next year, also plays a major role when it comes to the verdict that will be delivered on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide for Bolivia, and that there will be little change even if it does.
The United Nations body with its seat in the Netherlands has no power to allocate Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not decide on the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the verdict was pronounced only six months after the last arguments were heard indicates that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of making progress in the Bolivian case, for the last four years he may have been left behind.
"The problem of going out to sea has been captured by the current Bolivian authorities," Zarate said.
Morale's war rhetoric has killed the rest of Chilean goodwill, it's gone.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at one time, but it will be very difficult to hold those negotiations after this.
These two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, has rejected the idea that the court's decision is unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "put a point on 139 years of disagreement for mutual satisfaction," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America's most popular presidents – is using the issue of going to sea as a political rat.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to go out on the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to realize that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says there will be no disarmament until they can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would not cease nuclear weapons until they believed in Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to comply with the promises made during the Singapore summit between conflict leaders.
His comments came at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed at the border to resume the deadlock of nuclear negotiations, more than three months after Singapore and a meeting with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Rey says it's just a dream that the continuation of the sanctions and the U.S. opposition to the declaration ending the Korean war will ever throw North Korea on its knees.
Washington is not ready to agree with the statement until Pjonjang takes significant steps towards disarmament.
And Kim and American President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, the government is generally skeptical when it comes to the seriousness of Pjonjang's rejection of the nuclear arsenal that that country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompey plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare another Kim and Trump summit.
In Paris fashion magazines presented the latest lines of huge hats you will soon see in the nearby shopping street
If you want to increase the collection of hats or fully protect the sun, you are in the right place.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of massive hats on the tracks of their Spring and Summer 2019 magazines, based on the Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have won Instagram this summer, and these designers have shown their impressive creations on fashion trails.
Valentine's finest piece of hat was an overemphasized hat with a wide pern tray that swallowed the model's head.
Among the other loudening additions were the skulls with ornamental stone, the wizard's hat, even the pineapple, but their intention is not to keep your head from cold.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks, and that's just in time for Halloween.
Many of the scarved masks had wet lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than in high fashion.
One creation looked like a diving equipment with a dissal and a mask, and the other recalled a cornette with a distilled ice cream.
And if you are among those who follow a tendency to attract attention, then you are fortunate.
Those who follow the fashion predict that huge hats could be found on nearby shopping streets.
The huge hats came after La Bombe, a broken hat with a two-step radius that was seen on many stars, from Rihanne to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult brand that invented this very impractical hat that flooded social networks, sent another great creation on the track – a broken beach bag that was almost as big as the model it wore.
Zagastonarandjasta bag of raffia with rations and white leather lunch was highlighted detail of Jacquemus La Riviera collection for spring and summer 2019 at the Paris Fashion Week.
Stylist of the famous Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect large hats and beach bags to arrive at the shops in time for the next summer, since the designer left such a huge impression it would be difficult to ignore the demand for premeditated fashion supplements."
John Edward: Knowing the language is of key importance to the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland can be commended for their outstanding academic achievements, and this has continued in 2018 with a new series of extraordinary results on the exams, which has been further strengthened by individual and collective achievements in sport, art, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, this school, which represents the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strives to provide the best level of service to its students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further education, chosen career and place in the society of citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can devise and implement its own curriculum and programme, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable elective subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it's up to him.
If you speak to him in his language, it will warm his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build good relations and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of this year's exam, we see that the languages are at the top of the league table, with the highest pass ratings in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages received an A degree in the final secondary school exam.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students received A from the Mandarin language in the final exam in high school, while 72 percent of those learning German, 69 percent of those learning French and 63 percent of those learning Spanish also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as key skills that will undoubtedly need children and young people in the future.
Languages, as electoral objects, are now treated in the same way as STEM objects (natural sciences, technology, machinery and mathematics) and in independent schools programs, and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the British Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that 17 percent of the reasons for the difficulties in filling jobs were the shortage of those who know foreign languages.
Thus, knowing foreign languages is becoming more and more necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more potential jobs requiring knowledge of foreign languages, this skill is necessary in the world of globalisation.
No matter what career someone chooses, if he knows another language, he'll have a real advantage in the future because it's a lifelong skill.
They will be able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a person who speaks more languages in front of competition.
According to a survey conducted among more than 4,000 British in 2013, 75 per cent did not know how to speak another language well enough to conduct a conversation, while the French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 per cent.
Therefore, investing in learning foreign languages is important for today’s children.
Knowing more languages, especially those used in developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
Every school in Scotland is different when it comes to language learning.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for Great Britain by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, there will always be several languages you can choose from in independent schools, with professional teaching staff in this area.
Scotland's independent schools are dedicated to providing an environment for learning that will prepare children and give them the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future holds.
At this time, it cannot be denied that in the global business environment, language is of key importance for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages must certainly be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
LeBron will debit for Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting soon ends for fans who want to see LeBron James' first performance for Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James would play a pre-season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But you still don't know how many minutes she'll play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said at Lakers' official website.
Reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, said James would probably play a limited number of minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about plans in six games during Lakers' preseason.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season swords to prepare," he said.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump started a series of pre-election meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five scheduled meetings next week, including visits to friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While waiting for his vote to fill the empty spot in the Supreme Court, Trump plans to increase support in the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
When's Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for seven hours tonight after east time, on Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's meeting in West Virginia under live transmission on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about hearings this week regarding Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court, which was tense over charges of sexual harassment, and the expected vote in the Senate was delayed within seven days until the FBI conducts the investigation.
But the main objective of this series of meetings is to help Republicans achieve a better outcome in the November elections.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign said that meetings this week are being held to "give energy to volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters information.
"Congress control is such a key part of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the pre-election campaign season," the Reuters spokesman of Trump's campaign refused to present.
Scheduled at the Westbank Arena in Wheeling, tonight's meeting could bring together supporters from "Ohia and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the media from Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday there will be a second time this month Trump will visit West Virginia, a country in which he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, who is not well-informed in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to raise his rating in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters report.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team showed fighting to keep hope ahead of individual matches on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the four on Saturday afternoon may be exactly what this Ryder buys.
The bow tie is a completely inventive concept in sport, but one of those that players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
What do they think, who's got a swing right now?
"They took six points, and now four, so it can be said that the turn is on our side," said Jordan Speith on his way.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, four points more, with 12 more in play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, still believe they have some wind in their wings, and there are many things that give them encouragement, between the other forms of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each took three points of possible four.
Spieth was brilliant from the first to the last blow and led by his example.
Celebrations were becoming louder during his round to finally play a key hit for the unsolved result in the fourth match when he and Thomas were left behind for two after two.
His final hit with a 15-hole match was welcomed with a similar call, one that reflects the belief that there is hope for the American team.
"You just have to give it all up and take care of your sword," Spieth said.
That's all that's left of these players now.
18 holes that can bring glory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly Ryder Cup's main story.
An unusual but irresistible European couple have won all four matches and play without mistake.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't play God's punches on Saturday afternoon, and they avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
The game that they have shown up to now also the way they exchange energy with the loud audience has strengthened them in the position of the main favorites on Sunday and there are no more popular players than Fleetwood or Molinaria who could take a potential European victory while the sun falls over the Le Golf National clubs.
It would be best both at the same time at different holes.
However, it is still early to talk about the European celebration.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly mastered Sergey Garcia, a four-ball hero that morning, when he was playing in a couple with Alex Noren.
One divine blow and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spaniards and the Swedes in a hole from which they had not finally managed.
But on Sunday, no one can help you get out of your hole.
The game with four balls and fours is so fascinating to watch the proximity due to the interaction between couples, advice that they give and that they don't give, and the way in which the strategy can be changed at the moment.
Europe has been playing better as a team so far and has a great advantage before the final day, but this four-session has shown that the US team also has a desire to fight in which some have doubted, especially in the continental part of America.
Europe leads 10:6 before the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will enter Ryder's last cup with a significant advantage, since after Saturday's matches in the game with four balls and four won the 10-6 over the United States.
Invigorated couple, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, the first led with two victories over uninvited Tiger Woods, increasing the result so far in the Le Golf National Club's four points.
The Europeans Thomas Bjorn in the fight to take back the trophy they lost in the Hazeltin Golf Club two years ago, dominated over the inaccurate Americans in the morning game with four balls and won the 3:1 series.
The United States has provided more resistance to the tournament four, winning two matches, but could not reduce the residual.
Jim Furyk's team has to win eight points in 12 individual matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debut player who won four points in a row, while he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after a fantastic weekend, just another couple in Ryder's history who won four points in the first four matches.
After they ran over Woods and Patrick Reed in a game of four balls, they made great composition and mastered tired Woods and American debutor Bryson Dechambeau with even more convincing 5:4.
Woods, who pulled through two matches on Saturday, was flashing for moments, but now he's lost 19 of the 29 matches in a game with four balls and four and seven in a row.
Juston Rose, who rested during the morning game with four balls, returned to partner Henrik Stenson at the tournament four and suffered defeat 2:1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – the first and third in the world.
However, Europe did not all go according to the plan of this pleasant day south-west of Paris.
The triple winner of the Jordan Spyeth and Justin Thomas tournament set a goal for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a 2-1 victory over Jon Rahmo and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game to return and win Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4:3 in fours, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder's history did some team come back after the four points left in front of the individual matches, although Fury's side defending the title, was unsolved enough to hold the trophy.
However, after two days in another location, it seems that they could not make a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea orders "no speech" about unilateral disarmament if there is no confidence
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the extension of sanctions would deepen its mistrust in the United States and that in such circumstances the country would not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
At the annual UN General Assembly, Ri Yong Hu said North Korea has taken "significant steps to show good will" over the past year, such as the interruption of nuclear and missile testing, the dismantling of nuclear polygons and the promise that it will not multiply nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, there is no proper response from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there will be no talk of the first unilateral disarmament."
Although Ri repeated the well-known complaints of North Korea against Washington against the "stepping" approach to denuclearization that North Korea would be rewarded for taking steps, the significance of his statement was that he did not reject unilateral denuclearization from the game as Pjonjang had previously done.
Rei called for a joint statement by Kim Jong Una and Donald Trump at the first summit held between the current president of the United States and North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work on "denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula", while Trump pledged to provide North Korea with security guarantees.
North Korea is seeking the formal end of the Korean War (1950-53), but the United States has announced that Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington also listened to calls to mitigate international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States does not give up 'denuclearisation first' and increases the pressure on sanctions to achieve its goal in force, even resisting 'the declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can throw us on our knees is to let the dreams of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that prolonged sanctions increase our distrust."
Rey didn't mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that American leader was talking about in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae over the past five months and added: "If we were to negotiate this problem of denuclearization with South Korea, not with the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not come to such an unexplained position."
However, the tone of Rio's speech was radically different from last year's, when at the UN General Assembly he said the shooting of US ground missiles in North Korea was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim "missile" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take the disarmament steps, but said that much more should be done and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not set a time frame for this, saying, "If necessary, let it take two years, three years or five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps they have taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council Thursday: "Sanctions Security Councils must continue to be strictly and without failure to implement until complete, final, confirmed denuclearisation is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea that have been applied since 2006, in an attempt to disable the funding of nuclear and ballistic missile programmes in Pyongyang.
Pompey met with Rij outside the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
He's been in North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
In July he left Pyongyang with the words that he had made progress, and North Korea condemned him after just a few hours for bringing "gangster demands".
North Korea has promised to dismantle a missile polygon as well as a nuclear complex at a meeting with Moon this month if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim told him that "appropriate measures" required the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
The new course at Harvard University this year aims to make students sleep more in order to eradicate the increasingly popular cat culture of learning "all night with the help of caffeine".
One academic observed that students at the leading university in the world are often ignorant of basic care about themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, set up a course he believes to be the only species in the United States.
The inspiration to start this course was given after a speech that held about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
"In the end, a girl came to me and said, 'Why are you telling me this now, in my high school year?'
She said that no one ever told her how important a dream was – which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, presupposes the basis for how good sleep habits contribute to better academic and sports outcomes, as well as improving their general status.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University Health Service, said the university decided to introduce a course after it was observed that students suffered from a serious sleep disorder during the week.
A single course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part the picture of the room in the student home and students should click on the coffee cup, curtains, shoes and books to hear more about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as about the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performances and the importance of pre-sleep routines.
The other part tells participants that a long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then the map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We are aware that this will not at the moment change the behaviour of students.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know what health effects it has on smoking cigarettes," said Professor Cheisler.
The culture of pride for the "awaken night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students have led to a growing lack of sleep.
A sufficient amount of sleep, and this quality, should be the "secret weapon" of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even against a higher kilograms, because as a result of a lack of sleep, the brain goes into a hungering mode, so they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical biology from California, helped Professor Cheisler to develop a course after he attended one of his lectures last year at Harvard.
He says this course opened his eyes and inspired him to bet on his maintenance at the level of the entire campus.
It is hoped that the next step will be to ask all post-graduates to pass a similar study programme before accession to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting up an alarm in time for sleep and awakening and that they take into account the harmful effects of "blue light" that emit electronic displays and LED lighting and can disrupt the Circadian rhythm, thereby leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Mengin goal defeated Gerard's team
The Rangers experienced yet another depressing defeat in the guests when Dolly Menga sent a fuss to a clear Steven Gerrard team in a 1-0 defeat from Livingstone.
The team from Ibrox wanted to take the first victory in the guests after the February 4:1 triumph in St. Johnstone, but the team hired Gary Holt as manager of the second defeat in 18 matches, leaving his team eight points behind failed Leader Ladbrokes Prime Minister League, Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before half-time, and the uninspired position of Rangers never came even close to the equation.
While the Rangers are now falling to sixth place, Livingston is up to third and behind are the hibernians just because of the goal difference.
The Rangers could face additional problems after the plain judge Calum Spence had to show help when he was shot by some object on the side.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team that surpassed Ayr and placed herself in the Betfred Cup semifinal.
On the other hand, Holt was defined as the same eleven Livingstone players who last week took the point of Hearts and would be thrilled by the way his well-trained team pressured opponents at every step.
Maybe the Rangers dominated the owner of the ball, but Livingston made better use of his time with the ball.
It was a little short to reach the goal just two minutes after Menga first added Scott Pittman to the goal Allan McGregor, but the middle field player missed a big chance and shot next to the goal.
The deep-free hit by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in defense Alan Lithgow just managed to kick right next to the goal, at the end of the stand.
The Rangers managed to take control, but their game in the last third gave more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he was supposed to get a penalty in 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless got into a fight, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian request.
The Rangers only scored two goals in the first half, but the former Ibrox goalman, Liam Kelly, without any major problems, defended the impact on Lassana Coulibaly's head and captured the shot directed by Ovie Ejaria.
Although the first liveston goal in the 34th minute may not have reflected the real relationship of the force during the game, no one can argue that he was deserved, if nothing else, then because of the effort put into it.
The Rangers couldn't deal with Jacob's deep free kick again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard reacted to the interruption by introducing Ryan Kent instead of Coulibally and this replacement almost immediately resulted when the winged player hired Morelos, but impressive Kelly ran off his line and blocked it.
However, Livingston continued to instruct the guests to play exactly the way he suited them, with the long balls of Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's team had a chance to increase the advantage in the last few minutes, but McGregor kept up and defended Jacob's attack, then Lithgow from the corner to send the ball next to the goal.
A replacement Rangers player, Glenn Middleton, at the end of the game asked for another penalty when he hooked up with Jacobs, but Thomson didn't react again.
Almanah: Geiger's Designer
And now, the station from our Sunday Morning German: September 30, 1882 today 136 years ago... the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that will eventually become the device known as Geiger's counter.
In addition to being one of the main points of science, Geiger's counter has its place in pop culture, as in the 1950's Zvona Koronada film, in which they played apparently amazing cowboy scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, "What's that?"
Rogers: "It's Geiger's counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on those headphones, you can hear the effects of atoms by means of radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Yes, it's a crack!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine could teach an immune system to "see" evil cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach an immune system to "see" evil cells and then kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise malignancies within the treatment
The procedure includes the removal of immunological cells from patients and their laboratory changes
They can thus "see" proteins that are common in many types of cancers, and then inject themselves again
The test vaccine has shown promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The cancer of the woman’s eggs who received treatment with an immune system to recognise malignant cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The procedure includes the removal of immunological cells from the patient, their transformation into the laboratory so that they can "see" protein HER2, and their reinjection.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. Institute of Diseases at Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "helps growth of several types of cancer" including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung and colorectal, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to withdraw immunological cells from patients and "learning" the same as to target small cells was effective in treating one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West gave a harsh speech supporting Trump, wearing a MAGA hat, after his performance in the SNL.
He didn't have a good time.
Kanye West was released in a studio during Saturday Night Live's show after a battle performance in which American President Donald Trump praised him and said he would run in 2020.
After performing his third song called Ghost Town, that night he wore a hat with the title "Make America Big", he insulted the Democrats and talked again about his support for Trump.
"I've talked to white people so many times that they say, "How do you like Trump, he's a racist?
So if I cared about racism, I would have moved away from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started a sketch show in which Matt Damon played and in which a Hollywood star scoffed at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's judicial commission on allegations of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the video of West's speech was shared by comedian Chris Rock on social networks.
It's not clear if Rock tried to mock West by putting the tape on.
West also complained to the public that it was hard behind his hat.
"I was pushed behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat on your head."
I'm being harassed!
And then they say to me that I've got a crush," he said according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see what it looks like?" adding that "will wear Superman's coat because it means you can't order me.
Try love."
His comments sparked public whistles at least twice, and members of the SNL show were visiblely hit, Variety reported, while one person who was present said, "The entire studio is completely silent."
West was brought in as a replacement for Ariana Grande, whose ex-partner, Mac Miller's rapper, died a few days ago.
West has confused many by performing a song and hunts it down in a bottle of Perrier.
Westa supported the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the bravest souls: Thank you for not being dragged before the abusers."
But the show leader Karen Hunt tweeted that the West was simply "was what he really was and that it was absolutely beautiful".
"But I choose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his "art") for whom I believe he embraces and expands the ideology that harms my society.
He's free.
We are too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name, saying that he now "will be previously known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's footsteps, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion, and of course the late music legend Prince changed his name to symbol, and then to "an artist previously known as Prince".
The charge of attempted murder after a person was stabbed in a restaurant in Belfast
A 40-year-old is accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.

The defendant is expected to appear at the Belfast Criminal Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor.
The star of the series "Games of the Throne", Kit Harington condemned toxic cat culture
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow, who fights in a violent medieval fantasy, the HBO series of the throne game.
However, the actor (31) leaned on the stereotype of a hero's sword, saying that such roles on the screen mean that boys very often think they need to be rude in order to be respected.
In a statement on Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the toxic cat culture problem in #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married a partner from Leslie Rose's capital's Games (31), admitted that he had a "strong need" to deal with this problem.
"I am personally concerned about the question – what have we done wrong with the representation of manhood?" he said.
"What do we teach men as they grow up, when it comes to the problem we now see?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for spreading the toxic cat culture because of the display of characters that are represented as males.
And he said, “What is it that was born, and what is it that grows?
What is it that teaches us on TV and in the streets that makes young people think they have to fit into a certain pattern of behavior of men?
I think it's actually one of the main issues of our time — how can we change it?
Because obviously something went wrong for young people."
He also acknowledged in the interview that he would not agree to the lectures or sequels of the Game of the Throne after its conclusion next summer, saying that he "ended with battlefields and horses".
From November on, Kit will play in the playpiece of Sam Shepard True West, talking about the film producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently discovered that he thinks that what he met his wife Rose was the best thing that happened in the game of the throne.
"In this series I have met my wife, so it can be said that she has given me a future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, a love partner of Kitt's character Jon Snow in this fantastic series that won Emmy's award.
A couple were married in June 2018 at the property of Leslie's parents in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a rise in new cases of 14%
China reported a 14% jump in the number of new cases of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been hit, health officials say.
Some 40,000 new cases were recorded only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases have been transmitted through sex, which is a change compared to the previous situation.
In the past, HIV has been rapidly spreading to some parts of China as a result of a blood transfusion infected with the virus.
However, the number of people in this way getting HIV is almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual relations is a hot issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China is no longer considered illegal since 1997, but they say that LGBT discrimination is very widespread.
Studies estimate that due to conservative country understandings, between 70 and 90% of men who have sexual relations with men eventually marry women.
The transmission of the virus is often due to inadequate sexual protection in such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to medicines for HIV as part of a plan to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denied the allegations that one of her staff had published information about the Republican senators, condemning "dangerous lies" and "theory of conspiracy"
U.S. MP Maxine Waters has denied the statement that one of her staff has published personal data from three US republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of these legislators.
The Democratic MP from Los Angeles claims that these claims are placed by experts and websites of the ultra-trading wing.
"False, lie and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a post on Twitter.
Published information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the network on Thursday, and an unknown person announced it on Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate commission on sexual harassment instructions against the Supreme Court candidate Bretta Kavanaugh.
The announcement of the information came at some point after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative web sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publication is linked to the Waters office and published information about its staff member, Hill reported.
"This unsubstantiated claim is a completely inaccurate and absolute lie," Waters continued.
"A member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security are at stake because of these false and incorrect claims – is not in any way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is an entirely inaccurate and absolute lie."
Waters' statement soon led to a conviction on the Internet, which he issued by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial goes mad," Fleischer wrote.
"This leads to the conclusion that she does not have the temper that is needed for a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he must not be angry.
He can't be a jerk.
He must not question the defendant's motives.
They must be calm and calm."
Fleischer obviously compared Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's democrats, whom critics accused of acting too angry at hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was running to change Waters in the middle of the mandate, also reported on Twitter.
"A great thing if it's true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office warned "the appropriate competent authorities and judicial authorities about these false claims".
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered," she continued, "and that they are responsible before the law for all their actions that are unstable and dangerous to all members of my staff."
film review Johnny English again in action – a milk spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It has already become a tradition to look for a subtext on Brexit in every new British theme film, which can also be applied to this continuation of the Francisce of satirical action comedies about Johnny English – which began in 2003 with the creation of "Johnny English" and returned to screens in 2011 with "Johnny English: Reborn".
Will ironic self-satisfaction about how obviously useless we are being a new export opportunity for the nation?
Either way, a bullish, incompetent Johnny English rubber face had a new chance to blow something up – with his name more than anything saying that it was a general comical creation designed for cinematographic audiences with no English mother tongue.
It is, of course, a foolish secret agent who, despite the bizarre claims of the highest glamour, wears a little Clouseau, a little Mr. Bean and a piece of that guy who played only one note in the theme melody of the "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony in London 2012.
It was also originally based on a passenger and an international man who had published a great secret that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV advertisements, leaving chaos behind.
One or two scenes of the newest is caught are good.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval knight armor and when the rotor blades briefly whistled about his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is obvious, but humor seems weak and in a very strange way too much, especially now that "serious" film brands like 007 and the Impossible Mission are confident to add comic elements.
The idea is that it's about humor for children, not adults, and for me, Johnny English's disillusioned adventures are not inventive and diluted like Atkinson's gegos in the style of hate movies like Mr. Bean.
Now it's a very current theme that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
Hacker infiltrated into the British super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of an agent on duty – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop in a glass of water for a prime minister, a shy and influential character who already has a complete scratch because of a fall in political popularity: Emma Thomson masterfully played this character designed by the example of Theresa May, but the script is rather scarce.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that all active spies are compromised and that she will have to hire one of the pensioners.
And that means the dumb Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in some sophisticated institution, but informally holds lessons about how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting geologists when English holds a school of spying in the way of the movie "School Hand".
The English are quickly returning to Whitehall for emergency instructions and to recompile it with former incredibly patient partner Bough, who plays Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander in whose energetic and noisy role Vicki Pepperdine is a bit consumed.
So Batman and Robin are once again in the service of Her Majesty's secret service and luck to a beautiful fatal woman, Ophelia Bulletin, interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the trap of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems: criminal Jason Volta, who plays Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their stay of comic events: broken into canoes, they set fire to an elegant French restaurant, a real chaos crisscrossing the Volta luxury yacht and English will start a real anarchy by trying to get to know the interior of Volta's house using a virtual reality headphone.
Clearly, a great effort has been made in that last sequence, but no matter how pleasant and joyful the whole film is as if it was made for children.
Pretty central quality.
Like in other movies about Johnny English, I can't help but wonder: can the British film industry think of a role for Rowan Atkinson that would really show his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it makes a plan for the British to work for four days a week and be paid in five days
The Jeremiah Corbyn Labour Party will consider a radical plan that the British would work for four days a week, but were paid for five.
The party allegedly wants the company's bosses to spend time saving workers thanks to the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them another day off.
The employees would enjoy this three-day weekend – but would still receive the same salary.
Sources say that this idea would "apply" to the economic program of the party and plans to improve working conditions and workers' rights.
The shift to a four-day working week approved the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A high source of the Labour Party said to Sunday Times: "New policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but the four-day working week is an ambition that fits in with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party's industrial strategy at all."
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea because the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 pre-election campaign.
However, this ambition does not support the entire Labour Party.
The Labour Party spokesperson said: "The four-day working week is not party policy and the party is not considering it."
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to expose his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power from the hands of "non-personal directors" and "profits" in municipal businesses.
The opposition's plans also mean that current shareholders in water supply companies may not recover their total investments because the Labourers could impose "debts" on the basis of perceived injustices.
He also confirmed plans to include employees in company committees and create inclusive ownership funds that would allocate 10 per cent of the value of companies in the private sector to employees for whom it is likely to kill annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy is talking about a 60-minute show about whether the FBI investigation could change their opinion.
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has suspended the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question whether the Bureau's investigation could lead some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, a "60-minute" newsletter by Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy felt more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I think, of course," said Kennedy.
"Before the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came up, I asked, "Did you do it?"
He was invincible, determined, in no wise.
Senator Graham's voice, however, seems to be jammed.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh was formed and there would be a need for a strong indictment," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett vigorously denied it," Graham added, speaking of Christine Blasey Ford.
"And anyone she calls it can't confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is a festival of citizens of the world and did he do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of World Citizens, an annual music event with a truly impressive list of stars to perform, and an equally impressive goal – to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizens' Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people on a large grassroots Central Park who will not only enjoy the performances of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the true goal of this event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival, which was held for the first time in 2012, is a continuation of a global project against poverty, an international group that is committed to eradicating poverty by increasing the number of people who will actively fight it.
To get a free card for the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP card), those who wanted to attend the concert had to do a series of tasks or "work", such as volunteering, sending e-mails to world leaders, telephone calls and any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal – ending poverty.
But how successful is the citizen's project of the world with only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of awarding people with a free concert the right way to convince people to take action, or just another view of what is called "clickivism" – when people believe they have done something that will change the world by signing a petition on the Internet or tweeting?
Since 2011, the citizens of the world have claimed to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of their supporters who have been betting on a number of different goals.
They say these actions have prompted world leaders to publish promises and policies worth more than $37 billion and will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group entered 390 promises and published their shares, and at least $10 billion has already been allocated or collected.
The group estimates that the funds collected have already directly affected 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key promises are the Power of Food, a partnership of investors and performers from Britain who promised to "help children grow up to their full potential", promising that Rwanda would allocate 35m dollars to end food shortages in that country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from citizens of the world.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, as you are, we can make the social injustice of nutrition become a historic hub," said Power of Food Ambassador Tracey Ullman, to live concert visitors in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions called on the United Kingdom to improve the hierarchy of mothers and children, the government announced that it would finance the Power of Nutrition project, whose interventions will affect the lives of 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their page that says, "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
And the citizens of the world will say, "It will be a long and difficult path, and sometimes we will fall down and be crushed."
However, like all major civil rights and apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are just some of the artists who will perform at this year's New York event, led by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could "block" Russia in energy exports – Secretary of Internal Affairs
Washington can "if necessary" use its Navy to prevent Russian energy exports to third markets, including the Middle East, discovered Ryan Zinke, an American secretary of internal affairs, and transferred Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that Russia's engagement in Syria – namely, there they are at the call of the legitimate government – is an excuse for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe and the centre of southern Europe," he allegedly said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means of resolving this issue.
"The United States has the opportunity to ensure, together with our Navy, that sea corridors remain open or block them, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke was referring to the presence of the event that was organised by the Energy Union, a non-profit group that called itself "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He made a comparison with Washington's approach to relations with Russia and Iran, finding it was the same thing.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is less-than-the-number in fuel use and replacement," he said, saying that Russia has only one asset, and that its economy depends on fossil fuels.
Statements come after the Trump Administration's mission to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a far more favourable option for European consumers.
To that end, officials of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unappropriate" North Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which would, according to Trump, make Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream pipeline is worth $11 billion and that the existing gas pipeline capacity should be doubled to 110 billion cubic metres, exclusively a commercial project.
Kremlin claims that the reasons for Washington's fierce opposition to this project are purely economical and that this is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should have the option of selecting a supplier," Russian Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, who was held in Moscow in September.
The state of the United States has provoked Germany's reaction, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industrial organisation in Germany, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), urged the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when some third country is involved in our supply of energy," said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider seriously" about the presidential candidacy for 2020, states Senator Massachusetts
Senator Masachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "consider seriously" to run for president after the next mid-term elections.
During a meeting in the city council in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider candidacy.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our corrupt government, which includes a woman at the top," she said, and transmits the source The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously think about running for the president."
Warren called on President Donald Trump during a meeting in the city council, saying he is "leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was summoned for criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court judge, Brett Kavanaugh.
In her tweet that she posted on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI inquiry before the vote."
However, the results of the poll published on Thursday showed that the majority of the electoral body that voted for Warren did not think that it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of voters who will "probably" vote in the state of Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by the Center for Political Research at the University of Suffolk/list Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The survey has shown that there is greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38% of voters supporting potential candidacy and 48% against candidacy.
The other names of a number of democrats who spoke about in terms of their potential candidate in 2020 are former vice-president Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd make an official decision by January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talked about PTSP Track Palin on Donald Trump's joint support
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after the September recruitment.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence after the incident that happened on Monday night
"What my son is going through, what he goes through after his return, can be linked to what is happening to other families suffering from the consequences of the PTSP and the vulnerability that our soldiers are returning with," said public at the joint support of President Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "a hot topic" and, speaking of his son and other war veterans, added "they return a little differently, return harder, return wondering if there is respect for what their friends are soldiers and pilots, and all other members of the army have given for this country."
He was arrested on Monday in the city of Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence - an assault on a female person, an interference with reporting domestic violence and possession of weapons under opiates, according to Dan Bennett, spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Administration.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia District support the re-examination of a new US policy that reduces asylum for victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 countries and Districts filed a friendly report in Washington on Friday to provide support to asylum seekers who challenge this policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace's action against the Sessions filed by the US Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal police has not been discovered.
She said her partner had abused her "and violent members of his gang," but US officials rejected her claim for asylum on July 20th.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace explained how the states of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers in the United States are facing a growing problem related to gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy annulled the 2014 Immigrant Complaints Committee's 2014 decision to allow immigrants who do not have documents and flee from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
State Prosecutor District Columbia, General Karl Racine, said in a statement he made on Friday that the new policy "is neglecting decades of state, federal and international law."
"The federal law requires that all asylum requirements be decided on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the request, and that the chamber thus violates that principle," the friendly report states.
Lawyers continue to claim that the police that disables entry to immigrants are damaging the US economy, and that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and "ensure the necessary workforce".
In June, State Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges in migrant-related cases to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Azil is only available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of belonging to a particular race, religion, nationality or social group or because of their political opinion," Sessions said in a statement of 11 June about politics.
The purpose of asylum was never to alleviate all the problems, even all the serious problems people around the world face every day.
Desperate efforts to save the city of Palu as the number of dead doubles in search of survivors
The situation for survivors is getting worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her sick little boy in the evacuation center in the deserted town of Pala.
"Every minute, emergency assistance brings bodies.
The government is depleting clean water."
The residents return to their broken homes, wander about inundated things, trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and the patients are suffering from an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
Some of the wounded like the Dwi Harris with broken back and shoulder are located outside the Palu's Military Hospital, where patients are provided with help outside due to continued severe throbbing.
His eyes are filled with tears as he talks about how he felt a strong earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was pressed by the ruins of the wall," Harris told the agency Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, and then quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "violence by advertising"
Seven days after official Chinese newspapers published an ad on four pages in the U.S. Daily newspapers, thanks to the mutual benefit of trade between the US and China, the US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump turned Wednesday to a paid Chinese newspaper supplement China Daily at the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of being involved in the US Congress elections to be held on November 6th, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to get involved in American elections indicates how American officials told agency Reuters, a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
And while it is customary for the parties to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a escalating trade war where each other increases import tariffs.
As a countermeasure, earlier Chinese tariffs in this trade war were directed at exporters in countries such as Iowa, which supports the Trump Republican Party, said in Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, an American ambassador to China and former Iowa's long-standing mayor, who is the leading exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has damaged US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a comment published in the Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register, "now doubles that violence by publishing propaganda ads in our free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is exploiting the precious American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, placing paid ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the kiosk down the street in Beijing, you will find a limited number of different opinions and you will not be able to see any true reflection of the different opinions that people in China may have about China's problematic business path, bearing in mind that Chinese media are under a hard stick of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers has refused to publish the offer" his article, although he did not mention what it was about.
Republicans turn women away from the middle-term elections with the debacle of Kavanaugh, analysts warn
Analysts warned that a large number of the most prominent republicans who defend and stand with the candidate for the Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several allegations of alleged sexual assaults, will experience negative reactions, especially women, during the upcoming mid-term elections.
The emotions associated with this issue are very intense and most Republicans already show that they want to give their voice.
In these things there is no return," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University Syracuse, in an article for the magazine that was published on Saturday.
Reeher said he suspected that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arison) would have recently asked the FBI's investigation to be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and state spokesman for the Progressive Group MoveOn, said on Friday in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators called "the new bar is coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate hall, while Republicans controlling the Justice Committee decided to investigate with Kavanaugh candidate despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be huge," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
"People say it's already high, which is true.
But it could be higher, especially among indecisive female voters in suburbs and among younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who do not like the president, do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which she made details of the allegations of alleged sexual assault against a candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts were of the opinion that negative reactions could occur if the Republicans continued to nominate.
"This has become a big mess for the Big Old Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee earlier this week, broadcasts NBC News.
"It's not only about the Committee's vote or the final vote, nor about whether Kavanaugh will be a judge, it's also about how the republicans dealt with this issue and how they dealt with it," said Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA group, who supports the choice of democrats.
Yet, it seems that the Americans have been somewhat divided in respect of those who believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slight inclination on the part of Kavanaugh.
The new YouTube survey shows that 41% of respondents definitely or probably believe in Ford's testimony, while 35% said they definitely or probably believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying during his testimony, while only 30% said they thought so about Ford.
After Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other person who filed the indictment, Deborah Ramirez, reported the Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Justice Committee last week under oath that Kavanaugh had attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez allegedly claimed that her candidate for the Supreme Court's trial showed her genitalia as they attended parties during their studies at Yale in the 1980s.
An inventor of the World Wide Web network plans to start a new Internet that will surpass Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, an inventor of the World Wide Web network, is launching a startup aimed at being a competitor to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company based on an open source solid platform, the creator of which is Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive dispute for Fast Company, Berners-Lee found the intention of Inrupt is "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own "personal data store on the network" or POD (personal online data store).
It may contain a list of contacts, a list of obligations, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, they're all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is unique for a personal data store on the network is that it depends entirely on who can access any kind of information.
The company calls it "personal data enhancement".
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea is that the Inrupt company provides sources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently made by Berners-Lee, Bruce, the IBM security platform, a number of employees of development engineers engaged in the project and the volunteer programmer community.
Since this week, technology engineers around the world can create their decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change where all their business models overnight will be completely destroyed.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a statement on Saturday on the medium platform, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission to secure commercial energy and ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of the new solid web."
Berners-Lee transformed the Internet in 1994 when he founded a World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a very influential voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Although Inrupt launches, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of Victoria's Crusades awarded to a priest in World War I
Celebrations to the honor of the only Anglican priest who was distinguished by the Victorian Cross as a fighter in World War I were relatively in his hometown 100 years later .
Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the recognition on September 29, 1918 for an attack on the cities of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
A few days later, however, he was killed by a sniper and never found out that he had won the greatest British military recognition.
At a parade held Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren discovered a memorial record.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the monument was discovered exactly 100 years after the promotion for which his grandfather received the award.
According to the London Gazette newspaper, September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal of Saint-Quentin "through a very dense cloud and under a strong fire from the battlefield and a mitral fire."
Later, he rushed to the fire line and with the "greatest heroism" led the water forward before he ran without help to the Polish top and cut down three from the military squad.
Colonel Vanna died of a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a little over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's moves were "something I know I could never achieve, but also something that causes obedience."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a vineyard after the parade conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "felt honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero shows the support that many will give."
MMA fans who stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, instead got Pepu Prasa
Imagine, you've been up all night watching a series of Bellator 206, so you can't finally be able to watch the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 battles, including six on the main list and was shown live during the night on Channel 5 in Britain.
At 6:00 in the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face, viewers in Great Britain were amazed when the transmission broke off Pep Prase.
Many were not even impressed that they stayed awake all night until early morning just because of the fight.
One Twitter fan described this interruption of transmission by cartoon film as "a kind of sick joke."
"It's about the government's regulation where it says that this content is inappropriate at 6 a.m., and they had to replace it with a children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president Bellator for marketing and communications, on the issue of transmission.
"Pepa Prase," yes.
Bellator Scott Coker, president of the company, said he would work on his schedule to include viewers from Britain in the future.
"I think when I'm talking about the revision, I think we can probably handle it," Coker said.
"But the transfer is there at six in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to accomplish anything until we have Sunday, when they already have Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the breakup came, they circled the script and they were all hostile.
We were trying to fix it. We thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't like that. It was about the government's jurisdiction.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce the number of fights from six to five, as we usually do, we tried to give more to our fans, but we've gone too far.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" about sexuality
Olympic driver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he only realized in high school that "they're not all like me."
Speaking on the first radio 4 Desert Island Discs, represented by Lauren Laverne, he said he openly spoke about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that what became a parent made him less worried about winning the Olympics.
The regular leader of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, was absent for several months because of the disease.
Appearing as a waste in Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "less valuable" during his growing years because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, these feelings of inferior value and the feeling that I was different were the real things that gave me the power and the strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove he was "someone," he said, so people don't get disappointed when they find out about his sexuality.
The double winner of the bronze Olympic medals became a very important fighter for the LGBT population and took advantage of his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was speaking because he was considered happy to have the opportunity to speak publicly without consequences and because he wanted to give others “hope. ”
The triple world champion said he was in love with a man, American producer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 "suddenly."
Daley was married last year to Oscar's winner, who was 20 years older than him, and he said the difference in years was never a problem.
"When you live so much while you're so young," he first appeared at the Olympics when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later, he said it's hard to find someone of the same age who experienced similar elevations and falls.
A couple took part in the role of Robert Ray Black-Daley's boy's parents in June, and Daley said his "total perspective" changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was only about "I have to win the gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more things than gold medals at the Olympic Games.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 in the 1940s after his brain tumor was diagnosed.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they still had tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "you won't be here to sit first, Dad," he said.
"I held him by the hand until he stopped breathing until he really stopped breathing and when he was dead I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I simply knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life - swimming in front of the home audience at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It served as an inspiration for his selection of the first song -- the Spring of Heather Small -- that responded in him while he was preparing for the Olympics and from which he was still passed by.
Desert Island Discs is on Radio 4 BBC program on Sunday at 11:15 a.m. after British summer.
Mickelson of shape on the bench at Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday when he'll play his 47th game at Ryder's Cup, but he'll have to get back in shape so this won't be a mess.
Mickelson, who plays at the 12th time highscore, Captain Jim Furik sent on a bench in Saturday games with four balls and four games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case for the United States, the five-time main winner spent the day cheering and improving the field in the game, hoping he would correct what was bothering him.
This 48-year-old, who has never been the best player, even at the top of his career, is not an ideal choice for the Le Golf National field, where the long uneven terrain regularly punishes the lost hits.
And if I'm not scary enough, Mickelson faces the British Open champion, Francesco Molinary, who won all four of their games this week in a team with the beginner Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who start 12 individual games with four points less, come to a hot start, Mickelson's game could be absolutely decisive.
Fury said he had confidence in his man, but he couldn't even say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, stabbed me on the shoulder and hugged me, and said he would be ready by tomorrow," Furik said.
"He strongly believes in himself.
He is a member of the House of Fame and has contributed so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I'm sure I didn't imagine playing two games.
I figured it'd be more, but that's how it went and we thought it had to go.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson's gonna score Nick Fald's record on Sunday for the number of Ryder Cups played.
It could mark the end of his career at Ryder's shop where he never fully reached the level of his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven half-times, although Furik said his presence brought a certain intangible value to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, he likes to joke with people and it's great to have such a guy on the team," he explained.
"I think it was fun for younger players to give him a chance, and this week, which was fun to watch.
He's giving a lot more than a break game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a huge advantage could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage in the final day of the individual Ryder Cup can easily turn into an awkward experience.
One day he first appeared at a game in the town of Valderram in 1997, when the party whose captain was Seve Ballesteros had the advantage of five points over the Americans, but ended the competition with a sharp difference of 141⁄2-131.2.
"You always remember that we had a great advantage in Valderram, we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderram where we won," said Bjorn, imagined after viewing the 2018 team that won the result 5-3 on Friday and yesterday led 10-6 on the Le Golf National field.
So history and everyone on that team will show me this isn't over.
You're going to finish tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get points on the table.
We have a goal, and that's to try to win this trophy, and that remains the focus.
I've been talking all the time, I've been targeting 12 players on our side, but we're very well aware of what's on the other side of the road - the world's largest players."
Excited by the performance of his players at the heavy golf tournament, Bjorn added: "I would never let this take me.
Tomorrow's a new day.
They're on the order of the individual games tomorrow, and that's something else.
It's great to be there with your partner when things go well, but when you're there alone, you're testing the final possibilities of yourself as a golfer.
That's the message you have to deliver to the players - give the best of yourself tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner and he must also do the best he can."
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague Jim Furik will ask his players to play better individually than they played in couples, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Surik himself was on both sides of those big turns of the last day, since he was part of a winning team in Brooklyn before he ended up as a loser after Europe performed "miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he answered when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, encouraged his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the very beginning of what you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When he's on such a ride, he creates a great pressure on the middle game.
We've shaped our position accordingly and we've prepared the guys so we're trying to do some magic tomorrow, you know."
Thomas is assigned to try to counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahmo, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the upper half.
"I went with this group of guys in this setting because I think it can cover all the way to the end," Bjorn said about selecting single players.
New German warship on hold
The new frigate of the German Navy was scheduled to be launched in 2014 to replace the old Cold War warships, but will not reach within a year due to system and emergency costs, local media reported.
The launch of the ship "Rheinland-Pfalz", a leading ship in the class of entirely new Baden-Württemberg frigates, was delayed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, quoted by the military spokesman.
The ship was to join the Navy in 2014, but problems after delivery threatened the fate of this ambitious project.
Four Baden-Württemberg sailors who were ordered in 2007 will replace the old Bremen frigates.
As far as is known, it will have a strong gun, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include long maintenance periods - it should be possible to spread the latest frigates up to two years without returning to the native port.
However, constant postponement means that the most modern warships, which should have enabled Germany to deploy forces outside its territory, will be obsolete at the time they start to use, says Die Zeit.
An unfortunate F125 frigate arrived last year in the newspaper, when the German Navy officially refused to release the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media have cited a number of key "software and hardware deficiencies" that would have made the ship unnecessary if it were deployed in a combat mission.
Software gaps were of particular importance because the Baden-Württemberg class ships will run a crew of about 120 sailors - exactly half of the number of people who run the old Bremen class fractals.
It also found that the ship was a significant burden reducing its impact and limiting the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
It is believed that 7,000 tonnes of heavy ship "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as heavy as the ships of the similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of a complete project, including staff training, is also becoming problematic.
It is said that it has reached an amazing 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), compared to the initial 2.2 billion.
The problems associated with the latest frigates are particularly significant in the light of recent warnings that the maritime power of Germany is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, president of the German Parliamentary Defence Commission, admitted that the Navy actually "is missing ships that can be deployed".
The official said that this problem has grown over time, because old ships have been cancelled, and no replacement ships have been acquired.
He complained that none of the baden-Wuerttemberg frigates could join the Navy.
National Fund Listens to the Secret Life of Bats
A new study carried out on one property in the mountains of Scotland aims to discover how bats use the landscape in search of food.
The results are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and serve as a guide in future conservation activities.
A study conducted by scientists from the National Fund of Scotland will follow ordinary bats and a species of soprano Pipistrelle, as well as the brown long bats and bats of the Daubenton species in the Gardens of Inverewe Gardens in West Ross.
Special recording devices will be set at key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
Employees and NHS volunteers will also perform mobile research using hand detectors.
Expert analysis of all records will determine the frequency of the bat calls and what they do.
Then a map of the habitat and a report will be produced to create a detailed picture of their behavior at the level of the landscape.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant in NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are the most important bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of work on housing management, such as the creation of livadas, and which is the best way to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development, which negatively affect the bed and the loss of their homes.
Windmills and lighting can also pose risks, including sticky paper and chemical processing of construction materials, and attacks of domestic cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their habit of hunting at night, their ears are much more useful than their eyes in catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location technique to locate bugs and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 ha of countries across the country, is very serious about bats.
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out checks, lay inspections, and sometimes rescue.
The organisation even established the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland at Threave's property in Dumfries and Galloway, which are home to eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
The manager of David Thompson's estate says the property is an ideal territory for them.
"Here in Thrave we have a large area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and all the good dwellings.
But there is still so much unknown about bats, so what we do here and in other properties will help us to understand better what they need to make progress."
He stresses how important it is to check that bats are on the property, because it is possible to accidentally destroy one mother's bed and kill up to 400 women and young people, which is likely to result in the destruction of the entire local population.
The bats are protected animals and the law prohibits the killing, abuse, harassment or destruction of their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a staff member of the Scottish Muscle Conservation Fund, encouraged the public to turn on and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don't know how the population of most of our species is developing."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape while lawyers prepare a complaint against the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo is accused of rape that he has been labeled "false news," saying that people "want to promote" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, who issued the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventusa was accused of raping one American named Kathryn Mayorg in a hotel room in Las Vegas 2009.
Apparently he paid her $375.000 to shut up this incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
Addressing his followers, 142 million of whom were recorded on Instagram Live's network, several hours after the indictment report, Ronaldo, 33, criticised reports calling them "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," the camera said a five-time gold ball winner.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to get the glory by talking about me, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player added smiling.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for these allegations, which they called "an inadmissible privacy suspect report," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "unmaterial damage to the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the injury, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident reportedly occurred in June 2009 at the hotel apartment Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorg allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her analically, according to documents delivered to the District Court of Clark County in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo kneeled on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was the "99% good guy" who failed those "1%".
The papers say Ronaldo confirmed that a couple had sex, but he was willing.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were photographed in the hospital, but that she later agreed to an extrajudicial deal because she felt "fear of revenge" and worried that she would "be publicly humiliated."
34-year-old says she's now looking for the termination of the deal because she's still traumatized by an alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he went to the Italian giant Juve for 100m euros.
Brexit: UK will forever regret losing car manufacturers
The UK will "always regret" if it loses world leader status in car production after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that "anxious" was what Toyota UK said to the BBC - if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement that it will temporarily stop production in its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays at the borders in case Bexit remains unagreed could lead to job losses.
A factory from Burnaston that manufactures Toyotin Auris and Avensis produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March we will see a stop production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Director General Toyote in Burnastone.
Other UK producers, including Hondu, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed fear of how cross-border trade would work if Britain left the EU without an agreement.
BMW, for example, says he'll close his mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main colors refer to what car manufacturers call the risks in the procurement chain in the Brexit case without an agreement.
The Toyote production line works on the "just in time" principle, where the parts arrive every 37 minutes from the UK and EU suppliers for cars made by order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it may come to a break at the border which can lead to a delay and a lack of parts to industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep supplies longer than one day in his factory in Derbyshire, they said from the company, so production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said the "Checkers" plan that offers Theresa May for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border".
"We need to have an agreement. We want to achieve the best agreement that will enable me to say, not only to enjoy the present success, but also to seize this opportunity," Radio 4 said in today's BBC programme.
"The example not only of Toyote but also of other manufacturers is that we have to be absolutely capable of continuing what has been extremely successful in a range of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be suspended, but warned that long-term additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory on the market and eventually reduce the number of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years and president of the union union union in the factory, said that his members were increasingly concerned: “According to my experience, when such jobs are closed, they never come back.
Vodka spokesperson said: "We must put forth a precise and convincing plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, they say from the White House
A very important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for another week" because the fight continues with the candidate for Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh, said from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates the case of Russian involvement in the elections, the links between Trump's assistants and Russia, and the potential interference of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire a Deputy Attorney General or not, thereby endangering Mr. Mueller's independence, it's been the subject of talks in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein also spoke about sounding to record talks with Trump and about the possibility of changing the president on the basis of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected these rumors.
But last Monday he was in the White House, in the middle of a rumor that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would not "want" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid interfering with the hearing of the Senate Judicial Commission at which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to carry out an investigation of charges against Kavanaugh for a week, thus further delaying the Senate's vote in full.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday at Fox News.
She answered a question about the meeting with Rosenstein: “The date for this is not yet established, it could be this week, and it could take another week, bearing in mind all the other things that are happening in connection with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I like the press always being notified."
Some journalists would reject this claim: Sandersov has not held a brief address for journalists in the White House since September 10.
Head Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lower number of short speeches is not the consequence of the resistance to the "theatrical behavior" of TV journalists, although she said, "I will agree with the fact that they are exaggerated."
Then she said the direct contact between Trump and the journalists would be strengthened.
"The president holds more sessions with questions and answers than one president before him," she said without stating the evidence: "We have seen these numbers."
A brief speech will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to directly ask the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do as much as we can, and you've seen us do it for the past few weeks, and those talks with the President of the United States will replace short talks with journalists."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences during an official visit.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, acting in front of the gathered journalists unconcerned and occasionally strange.
Secretary of Health writes to EU workers employed in the National Health Service (NHS) of Scotland on Brexit fears
The Health Secretary wrote to EU employees who work in Scotland NHS to express gratitude to the state and wish to stay after Brexit.
A member of the Parliament of Scotland, Jean Freeman, sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The government of Scotland has already pledged to meet the costs of addressing EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "The talks between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have been resumed during the summer, and decisions are expected this fall.
But the UK government has also accelerated its preparations for a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know for all of you this was a very restless time.
That is why I wanted to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, which benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
The defense team player State Tigers Tennessee, Christian Abercrombie, underwent an emergency operation after he injured his head in Saturday defeat 31:27 from the Vanderbilt Commodores Club, reported Mike Organ from Tennessee.
Chief Coach Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury happened shortly before the half-time.
"He came to the field line and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before they put it on the carrier and took it to further questioning.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris from the WSMV channel Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had completed the operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no detail about the type/range of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a student of the second year in a red dress, plays the first season for Tennessee State after crossing Illinois.
He had five total discounts on Saturday before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 discounts in the season.
Foreign buyers will charge higher taxes to buy real estate in the UK
Buyers from foreign countries will be charged higher taxes on the purchase of real estate in the UK, where additional funds will be used to help homeless people according to new conservation plans
This move will neutralize Corby's success in attracting young voters
More taxes will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The vault expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year - to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged higher taxes on the purchase of real estate in the UK, and additional money will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May will publish today.
This step will be considered by trying to neutralise the success that Jeremy Corbyn has achieved by trying to attract young voters to the promises that it will ensure more affordable housing and focus on those who earn more.
The higher taxes will be charged to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, thereby strengthening the government's intention to fight against open sleep.
An additional fee, which is in addition to the existing tax, including more levels, introduced two years ago on the second property and purchase for rent, could amount to even 3%.
The vault expects this move to increase revenue to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built real estate in London buys people who do not have a place in the UK, which makes prices grow, and for the first time, buyers who buy real estate become more difficult to become homeowners.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "spirit cities" because of a large number of foreign customers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a taxi reduction to help a larger number of young people come to their first home.
He accused construction companies of holding high real estate prices by buying the first opportunity of a land they don't use, and asked Mrs. May to resign from access house quotas as soon as possible in order to break off the British "demeanour of housing policy".
Mr. Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including the control of rental and the suspension of any resulting delegation.
He also wants to give councils greater authority to build new houses.
Mrs. May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to the prime minister to restore the British dream - that every new generation's life should be better.
And that means fixing our poor housing market.
Britain will always remain open to people who want to live, work and build life in it.
However, it cannot be right that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can easily buy houses as well as valuable British.
The dream of ownership over the house has become too far for many people, and inhumane sleep on the open still remains absolutely real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland"
Chief Sunderland Jack Ross says his "final ambition" is to be the management of the Scottish representation at a certain point in time.
The forty-two-year-old Scotland enjoys the challenge of returning to the life of a club from the northeast, currently in third place in the First League, with three points less than the leader.
This summer he moved to the Light Stadium after last season he returned St. Mirren to the Scottish Prime Minister's League.
"I wanted to perform for my country as a player.
I was in the B team, and that was it," Ross said about the BBC Scotland Sports Sound show.
"But I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child, and it always dragged me back.
However, such an opportunity would be offered only if I succeeded in running the club."
Rose's predecessors as Sanderland's managers include Dick Advocata, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of the Allo Athletic Club said he didn't feel peace because he came after such big names in such a big club, after he refused to offer Barnsley and Ipswich Town Clubs.
"The measure of my success at this point will be 'will I be able to get this club back to the Prime Minister'?
Judging from the structure and possibilities of this club, he undoubtedly falls into the Prime Minister's league," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get him there, but I think I'll only be able to be successful if I can get the club back to where it belongs."
Ross is only in the third year of his managerial career, after a period he spent as a deputy chief in Dambarton and 15 months he spent as part of the Harts coaching staff.
Then he helped allo recover from the fall in the third category, and St. Miren withdrew from the edge of the fall in the lower league to the winner of the next season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever during his toy career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real crossroads," recalled Allo's acquisition.
"I honestly believed that management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds weird because I wasn't bad, so I made a decent profit and enjoyed some solid achievements.
But playing can be hard.
That's so much you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and work pressure, but the management just fits me.
I've always wanted to deal with management and now I've been doing it, in my adult life, I haven't felt more comfortable than now."

The perfect time for a glass is Saturday at 17:30, discovers research
The summer wave of heat increased the traffic of British pubs fighting for survival, but increased the pressure on the chains of the restaurant.
In a group of pubs and bars there was growth of 2.7% in July, but traffic in restaurants fell by 4.8%, as figures show.
Peter Martin, from CGA’s consulting company, who collected the data, said: “The long-lasting solar time and longer than expected participation of England in the World Cup contributed to the follow-up of a similar pattern in July as in the previous month of June, when the pubs made growth of 2.8%, and the restaurants had an even greater fall.
The drop in traffic in restaurants from 1.8% in June only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars focused on drinks achieved far better results with higher growth than compared results from the previous period, rather than the drop in traffic in restaurants.
The pubs focused on food also died because of the sun, but not as dramatic as the owners of the restaurant.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars there is an increase in the sale of drinks by 6.6% per month, with a fall in the sale of food by three percent."
Paul Newman, from the Agency for the Analysis of Entertainment and Hospitality RSM, said: “These results continue to be a trend we have witnessed since the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social and sporting events are still the main factors when it comes to sales on the market outside the household.
It is not surprising that the groups of restaurants continue to fight hard, although the fall of 4.8% on the annual level will be particularly ill with the already present price pressure.
Long hot summer couldn't come up in time for food-focused guests, and time will show whether the moderate temperatures we had in August would provide a little over the necessary relief."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened facilities, amounted to 2.7% in July, reflecting slower growth of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, an industrial sales monitoring service for bars, pubs and restaurants in the UK, collects and analyzes data on the impact of 47 business groups with a total turnover of more than £9 billion and represents an accepted industrial measure.
Every fifth child has a secret order on social networks that hides from his parents
Every fifth child, some of whom have only 11 years of age, has a secret order on social networks that hides from his parents and teachers, discovers research
Research involving more than 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of "false Insta" pages
This news increased the fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" job that shows parents
Every five children, some of whom are only 11 years of age, are assigned to social networks that they hide from adults.
A study involving 20,000 high school students revealed a sudden increase in the "false Instagram" task, referring to the Instagram photo sharing site.
That news has fueled the fear of the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "main" order that shows parents, but they also have private orders.
One mother who came to the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who calls the other words "violently rape me."
The study conducted by the organization Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors of Independent Schools (HMC) revealed that 40% of children aged 11-18 had two profiles, while half of them acknowledged that they had private assignments.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It upsets the fact that so many teenagers are tempted to create space on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eliid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Sports Committee
Eilid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Sports Committee as an inoffensive director at the annual meeting of that administrative body.
Doyle is the most rewarding Scottish athlete, and the chairman of Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity for those who lead sports to benefit from her rich international experience over the past decade
"Eilid enjoys great respect for the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are sure that athletes in Scotland will have enormous benefits from its membership in the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of athletes and I hope that I can really contribute to sports in Scotland."
The American, who won a total of four Olympic gold, including 200-400-metre matches in 1996 in Atlantis, and now a regular expert on BBC, remained unmoved after he experienced a transitional ischaemic attack.
On Twitter he wrote: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said only time can show me if I'm going to recover and how much.
It's been a hard job, but I've completely recovered, learned to walk again, and today I've been working for agility!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising for a traitor in which the mother shares her views with the cows on the Internet
The company that produces the traitors shared their views on the Internet advertising that is more expensive than cow musars.
In order to mark the launch of the product described as "the first silent publisher", Elvie has published an advertisement inspired by a fun music video showing the freedom that the new pump provides to mothers who issue milk.
Four real mothers dance in a barn between the shade and cows with a song whose lyrics say, "Yes, I'm married, but I don't have a tail" and "If you haven't noticed, but it's not weird, they're my breasts."
The following refren reads: “Push, pump, feed my babies, pump, pump, pump myself.”
However, advertising published on the company's Facebook page caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video caused different reactions of the viewers, while many said it sheds light on the "horrible" dairy industries.
"The use of cows for advertising this product was a very bad decision.
And they have to get pregnant and give birth as well as we do to produce milk, but their babies are taken away a few days after they were born," someone wrote.

Another commented: “It is obvious that it is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use a traitor's ad for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "Adverts don't make sense."
Others stood in the defense of the ad, and one woman admitted that her song was "urnish".
"I think the idea is genius.
I'd buy this if I still got it.
Because of the betrayal, I felt like a cow.
Advertising's a little silly, but I figured it out.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Another commented: “This is a ridiculous advertising aimed at mothers who issue milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like “requirements”.
This is not an advertising that praises or gloats the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were all dancing with discreet pumps hidden in their breasts.
The concept of advertising is based on the knowledge that many mothers who betray milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely unheard of, no wire or tube, and stands in the breast for breast-feeding, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even come out while they betray milk.
Ana Balarin, a partner and executive creative director of Mother, commented: “Elvie's pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves bold and provocative launch.
By withdrawing parallels between the breast and the cow musar we wanted to focus on the issue of milk and all the challenges that go with it, showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new pump provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has gotten into news headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the track in the creation of Martha Jakubowska using this product.
Hundreds of children of migrants secretly moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of children detained has increased although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the sharp rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made it difficult to find caregivers for children.
Traditionally, most caregivers and themselves were migrants without documents who were afraid to jeopardize their country's chances of staying by acting to accept the child.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their household would have to give fingerprints and that these data would be shared with immigration services.
Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, said last week before Congress that this service had arrested dozens of people who applied for care for minors without a escort.
The service later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had not been convicted.
"Approximately 80% of those who are either caregivers or homeowners are illegal in this country, and a good part of them are foreigners who have committed criminal acts.
That's why we're going to keep looking for those people, Mr. Albence said.
In an effort to speed up the process, officials have introduced new rules that some of them will have to appear before the court within a month of detention, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, the workers at the hospital said.
Many will respond to a video call instead of a personal one to ask the immigration judge to have their status legalized.
Those for whom it is established that they do not meet the conditions will be quickly deported.
The longer the children remain closed, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to a flow of anger or a runaway attempt, the workers of the shelter and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say such risks are raised in larger institutions such as those in Tornillo, where it is much easier to predict signs indicating that the child has problems.
They have added that moving children to the tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to greet their friends can cause the trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria seeks urgent withdrawal of American, French and Turkish "occupational forces"
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouale also called on Syrian refugees to return, although the war in that country has lasted for eight years.
Mouale, who is also a deputy prime minister, said that the parties are illegal in the Syrian country, according to the statement of the fight against terrorism and "will be counted against them in an appropriate manner".
They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said at the session.
Moualem insisted that in Syria, "war against terrorism is almost over", where over 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said Damascus will continue "a holy struggle until we eliminate all Syrian terrorists", including terrorist groups and "every foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly responsible for training and advising Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this country in a war-torn.
With regard to refugees, Moualem said that there are good conditions for their return and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that encourage refugees not to return.
"We have invited the international community and humanitarian organisations to enable these returns," he said.
"They politicise what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that it will not help restore Syria until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement on the end of the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major rebellion in Idlib created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey agreement has prevented a major attack by the Syrian forces supporting Russia in a province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that a military action against the jihadists and combatants from the Nusra-related Al-Qaeda front would be launched, which would "be exhausted".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of the authorities and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the way to the elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions of the Syrian government to participate in the work of the committee, saying that the work of that body should be limited to "reviewing members of the current constitution" and alerted to the possibility of external involvement.
Why Trump will be chosen for another term
According to that logic, Trump would be re-elected in the 2020 elections unless, to which many Liberals are likely to hope, the revocation and scandal did not sooner break his mandate.
That would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end of the presidential term of all time!"
So far, there's no sign of a viewer's fatigue.
Since 2014, the impact rating has doubled to more than 1.05 million on the CNN channel and almost tripled to 1.6 million on the MSNBC channel.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the hit period, unlike four years ago when it had 1.7 million, and Rachel Maddow Show Channel MSNBC's show exceeded the cable channel rating with 3.5 million viewers during the hit evening.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's about something we don't understand," said Neal Baer's producer of the drama "Elected Survivors" on the ABC channel, about a government secretary who becomes president after the attack that destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a long-standing comedy writer and author of the book "Only funny parts: and a few cruel truths about putting in the Hollywood boys' club", has a different theory.
She remembers driving by taxi in Boston before the 2016 election..
The driver told her he'd vote for Trump.
Why did she ask?
"He said, 'because he's smiling at me'," Mrs. Scovell told me.
Chaos has fun value, too.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, stories coming from Washington can decide the future of the law on abortion from the Roe v. Wade procedure, whether immigrant families will be able to unite and what the state of global economy will be.
Exclusion is a luxury that can only be afforded by the most privileged viewers.
And yet, you went a little further from general information when you realized that you were watching a panel of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward used the sources of "deep backgrounds" for his book "Strah," about Paul Manafort's jacket from a noose skin worth $15,000 (“a section with a fat stand of babatitude”, wrote Washington Post) and the implications of the picturesque descriptions, this one, anatomy, Mr. Trump giving Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, will never look Super Maria with the same eyes again.
"Part of what he makes you experience as a reality show is that something feeds you every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and actor of the show Zalagaonica, commenting on the rotation of the acting position and the daily complexity of the Trump Show (criticising the American Football League, complimenting Kim Jong-una).
You can't let yourself miss one episode, otherwise you're left behind.
When I arrived this week at Mr. Fless, in front of his house on the northern coast of the island of Kauji, it was sunny at a temperature of about 80 degrees (27°C), but he closed himself in and watched MSNBC and filmed CNN at the same time.
He could not have separated himself from the screen, not while Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to face the Senate Judicial Commission and his future in the Supreme Court was uncertain.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows in the past, and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of Western civilization'," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Large flows of money side by side in the most uncertain mid-term election race for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the redeployment of congressional districts, resulting in two candidates in the race for the same place.
The recent border crossing of the district in the suburb of Pittsburgh led to the election of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who came to the head of the other county after the extraordinary elections last spring.
Lamb is fighting against another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently an old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely intertwined with a new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were unconstitutionally formed for the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district launched a campaign to finance the campaign between the main fundraising parties, the Committee collecting funds for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a massive victory in the widely viewed special elections for the 18th Pennsylvania Congression in March.
This position has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won a 20-point district.
Political analysts have given little priority to democracy.
The United States is considering the punishment of El Salvador for China's support, but then withdraws
The diplomats have found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little encouragement from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Panama Juan Carlos Varela and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the management team of the Trump organisation.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for " recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, a spokesperson for the Department, in a statement early in the month.
But the penalties were only considered for El Salvador, which is estimated to have received $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The sanctions proposed, including the reduction of financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would hardly hit this Central American country with a high rate of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, which should be the continuation of a similar last year's set which was a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants' flows to the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior officials of the administration had made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and that they had actually suspended any review of the sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, which is a sign of the importance that the administration adds to the meeting, the diplomats said.
And three American envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new heavy messages or Washington punishment.
Speaker of the White House on behalf of Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal debates on condition that they remain anonymous.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst near the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The next one to be prepared could be a report by Special Investigator Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of Trump's judiciary, which now has significant evidence in the public files.
Mr. Mueller also directed his investigation to discover a possible link between the Trump campaign and Russia's attack on the elections, according to reports.
If the majority changes in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just as he prepares to step back before the electorate, and perhaps before the jury.
It is a lot of 'if' and I do not want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall, nor those in Europe who are like him, is inevitable.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German soldiers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, only that the West resisted him and supported the Czechoslovakian people in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the ensuing massacres.
The course of history revolves around such breakthroughs, and the incessant march of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are now facing more such breakthroughs.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires the Deputy Chief Prosecutor, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's fate?
Rosenstein has been in an invincible position since this letter last year reported that he proposed a secret recording of the president and suggested that he was not like to perform the function.
Mr. Rosenstein says the statement from the Times is incorrect.
"How will we react if a recent FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his candidacy for the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote for Congress in the medium-term elections that Mr. Trump will call for responsibility?
If we fall into these tests, democracy will sleep a long winter dream.
But I believe we won't fall, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz to the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country where I was an ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America and 60 years later, sent me to light a candle for the Sabbath on that table with a cowardly cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorans from Rangers optimistic before facing Rapid from Vienna
The Rangers are host to Rapid from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that they will win over the Austrians, after an impressive remium in Spain against Villarrela at the beginning of this month, to put them in a good position to qualify from the Group of the European League.
The knee injury prevented the related player Graham Dorrans from debiting this season until an unresolved match with the Villareal final result 2-2, but he was convinced that Rangers could use that result as a jumpboard for further.
"It was a valuable point for us because Villareal is a good opponent," a 31-year-old player said.
"We entered the game believing that we could achieve something and went with the point.
Maybe we could have taken them, but everything in everything, the unresolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better at the first half, and we went back to the second, and we were better at it.
On Thursday, we are again expected to have a great European evening.
We hope we can take three points, but it will be a difficult match because they had a good result in the last game, although, with the support of the public, we can certainly push out and achieve a positive result.
Last year was no doubt hard, the beginning of everything that happened to my injuries and the change in the club itself, but now we're happy with what we have right now.
The team's in good shape and the guys really enjoy it; we're good at training.
I hope we can continue now, leave the past season behind and be successful."
Women can't sleep out of worry about saving their pension
Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear idea of how to want to care for them, a few of them talked to members of their families about it.
About half of the people involved in the nationwide research said they were talking to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10% of them said they talked to their children about it.
"People want someone in the family to take care of them, but don't want to start a conversation on this," says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Life Insurance Sector at the Nationwide company.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and your family and consider where and how to provide it, because such decisions can be a significant factor in determining the price.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can help you and figure out how to pay for your expenses.
Your choice of long-term care funding can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value that will help you to cover these costs or self-insurance with your own savings – provided you have enough money.
Arrange your legal documents: Prevent legal battles at the root.
Make a decision to make medical assistance decisions in order to have a trusted person who will supervise the medical care provided to you and ensure that your healthcare professionals act in accordance with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider, too, the conclusion of an agreement on the power of finance.
This means that you choose a person of trust who will make financial decisions on your behalf and take care of paying your bills if you remain weak.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a situation where he needs urgent medical attention and is taken to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Enter the details in the written plan to be ready.
"It's not only about finances, it's also about who the doctors are?" Martin asked.
"What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Plan it."
A man shot with several air rifle shots in Ilfracombe
One man was shot with more air rifle shots as he walked home from the evening exit.
The victim, in her 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
The police described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m. in British summer time, as a "sudden act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries aren't life-threatening, and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died of a severe earthquake and tsunamis that hit the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, officials announced, and the number of dead growth is expected.
As a result of the disconnection, relief officials were unable to obtain any information from Dongala, a region north of Palu, which is closer to the magnitude 7.5 earthquake epicenter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palou after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongali, on the island of Sulawesia:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi, located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by earthquakes and tsunamis.
It reached a county extending more than 300 km (180 miles) of the northwestern coast of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, which is administratively lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the basis for the agriculture of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but mostly concentrated in Morowalia, on the opposite coast of Sulawesia.
Pala and Dongala have been hit by tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938 he killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongali.
Cunami hit and hit West Dongal in 1996 when nine people died.
Indonesia is on the seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26th caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Aceh.
2005: The series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6,8-degree earthquake hit the south of Java, the most populated Indonesian island, with tsunamis that struck the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: The 7.6-degree earthquake hit the town of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the island of Mentawai, near Sumatra, which caused tsunamis up to 10 meters that destroyed tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The sudden earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya region in Aceh, causing destruction and panic because it reminded people of the deadly destruction of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died in the collapse of the building.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists remained temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for family violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Governor of Alaska and the candidate for Vice President Sara Palin, was arrested for charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from the city of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion that he had committed domestic violence, interfered with reporting domestic violence and was opposed to arrest, reports a report published by the state police agency of Alaska on Saturday.
According to the police report, when the acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin was detained in Mat-Su's detention unit and a $500 contingent bail was fixed, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where on the matter of an explanation of guilt he explained that "it is certainly not guilty," the network said.
Palin's been facing three Class A violations, which means he's threatened with a prison sentence of up to a year and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a B-class violation, which is punishable by one day's prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palina's convictions have been filed.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palina.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report an alleged attack.
The case is currently before the court of vets in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, interference with the reporting of domestic violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholised state associated with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin criticised the veterinary groups in 2016 after she brought into contact with her son's violent behaviour with the PTSP after his service in Iraq.
tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Earthquakes of 7.5 degrees that caused tsunamis have destroyed hundreds of homes.
There has been a break in the connections and supply of electricity, and the number of dead people is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake epicenter was directly next to the central part of Sulawesia, northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
There's video footage on social networks showing a moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the town of Pala when the tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors are looking for a rare death penalty for a terrorist attack suspect in New York.
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for a death penalty for Sayfill Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York where eight people died -- a rare sentence that for a federal crime in the country has not been committed since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used the rented truck of the company Home Depot to carry out an attack on the bicycle track along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, which took off the pedestrians and bikers who were on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the plaintiffs will have to prove that Saip's "intentional" killed eight victims and "intentional" caused serious bodily injury, it is mentioned in the request for the death penalty, which was filed in the southern district of New York.
According to both of these points, the death penalty can be pronounced, as stated in the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury accused Saipov of 22 counts of charges involving eight charges of murder and recruitment, which the federal prosecutors usually use in cases of organised crime, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "significant planning and preconceived," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as "disgusted, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelinija, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlie, Hernana Ferruchi, Hernana Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci," he said in a sentence.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been decades since New York's southern district last had a case where a death penalty was threatened.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty in a federal case in New York was executed in 1953 by Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both of Rosenberg's were killed on June 19, 1953 in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not show remorse in days and months after the attack.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that after watching the ISIS video on his phone he was inspired to carry out an attack, he was charged.
He also asked to highlight the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He made it clear he wasn't guilty of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were clearly disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death penalty, instead of accepting life imprisonment without the possibility of acquittal of guilt, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saip's defense had previously asked the prosecution not to sentence death.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilise the national army" today during a protest at the conservative conference.
The former leader of the independence party, the UK, said that politicians had to "sympathize" with Eurosceptics, since one of the MPs Therese May suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative Representative Peter Bone said at a meeting in Birmingham that the UK would have "exit" so far that Mr. Farage was Brexit's secretary.
But the challenge that Mrs May faced in trying to unite her deep-separated lines has been stressed by conservatives who advocate a stay in the EU and who joined a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain his compromise plan from Chequersa despite attacks and by Brexit's and EU opponents.
The allies insisted that it continue with efforts to conclude an agreement with Brussels despite negative reactions, and forced Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between its package and "chaos".
Mr. Bone said at the meeting Go away means to go to Solihull that he wants to "reject the Chequers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should be given a title and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were the chief, we'd be out by now," he said.
An ambassador from Wellingborough added, "I will fight for Brexit, but we must expel the Chequers."
Explaining its opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be subordinated.
We want to bring our laws into our country."
Mr. Bone has rejected the statement that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their opinion and that they want to remain completely inaccurate."
Brexit's partner, Andrea Jenkins, who also attended the meeting, told reporters: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequersa plan is not popular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, is not popular in our party and among our activists who were actually those who went out on the streets and chose us.
"Please reject the plan from the Chequers and start listening."
In a strong message, Mrs. May added: “The prime ministers manage to keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Mr. Farage told the gathered that politicians must be forced to "feel discontent" if they are going to fail the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us -- people and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to play Brexit, and we're here today to tell them "that won't happen to you".
In a letter to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want our political class, which is at the brink of Brexit’s betrayal, to feel discontent.
"We mobilize the national army of this country that has won us in Brexit and will not calm down until we become independent, self-government, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the remaining prisoners marched through Birmingham before holding a two-year meeting in the city centre.
A number of activists were waving the "Torieves against Brexit" transparency after the formation of the group this weekend.
Labourer Lord Adonis joked with the conservatives about the security problems they had with the party's application at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the Canada Plus Plan, for the unimpeded state of the border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a complete farce.
Good Brexit's not possible," he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider candidacy for the president.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says he will seriously consider candidacy for the president" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reports that a homemaker from Massachusetts was talking about her future during a participatory meeting in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, was once again running for elections in November against a Republican representative at the Geoffa Diehl House, who was co-chairing the Trump campaign in Massachusetts 2016.
It is at the centre of speculation so that it can cope with Trump 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with the electors at which the participatory format of the meeting was used since Trump came into office.

Police in Baton Rouge, La., reported on Saturday's arrest of a gunman who was killed on Friday by LSU Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge police station reported arresting Ditheon Simpson, 20, at 11:00 at a press conference.
On Friday, a video of the shooting was released, looking for help finding the man you see on the tape.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the order assures him of victory over Sebastian Vettel.
From the moment Valteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the order of teams would play a major role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the beginning and almost left Hamilton behind as he defended his position in the first two circles and called on Vettel to attack members of his team.
Vettel first went into the box and left Hamilton behind to get involved in traffic at the beginning, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered the box one round later and went out behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after the action a wheel from the wheel that caused Ferrari to leave the free interior with the risk of delay after a double move in defense of the third turn.
Max Vertappen started from the last line of the grid and was the seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the race, relying on his tires to reach a fast finish and run Kimie Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally got into a box in the 44th round, but failed to speed up the pace in the remaining eight rounds while Raikkonen took fourth place.
The day was hard because Valteri was doing a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team did a really great job to achieve one-two formations finish," Hamilton said.
That was a very bad body speech.
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Diana Feinsten at a meeting on Saturday because of her insistence that she did not release Christine Blasey Ford's letter to the public in which a candidate for the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court accused of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly witness Ford before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are wicked, wicked and false.
The only thing that could have happened and the wonderful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and wicked and ungrateful and lying, he said.
When you look at the publications and the information that was leaked into the public, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it."
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you let the information go to the public?
You remember her answer? Did you let the document go to the public?
Oh, no.
I didn't let it go to the public."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we let... no, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Ford sent Feinstein a letter in July detailing Ford's statements against Kavanaugh, and it leaked in early September - however Feinsten demented that information was leaked from her office.
I didn't hide Dr. Ford's clues, I didn't let her story go public."
She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret, as she asked."
But her denial did not find the President's approval, who, at a meeting on Saturday night, commented: To tell you, it was really a bad speech of the body.
Maybe it's not, but I've never seen a worse body speech in my life."
Continuing his defence of the High Court candidate, whom three women accused of sexual abuse, the president suggested that the democrats use these instructions for their own purposes.
They are determined to regain power at all costs.
You see the evil, the flaw, they don't care who's going to hurt, who they have to run for to come to power and control," Mediate conveys the President's words.

The air traffic controller lost his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on the plane escaped an earthquake.
The air traffic controller in Indonesia declared a hero after he died securing a safe flight from hundreds of people.
More than 800 people died, and many water disappear after a powerful earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering tsunamis.
Heavy payouts continue to hit this area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing trying to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Aggung refused to leave his workplace at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Pala airport.
He remained to ensure a safe flight of Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then standing on the runway.
When he realized the control tower was crashing, he jumped out of it.
He passed by later in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirat, said that his decision might have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transfer it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
Our heart breaks because of this news," he added.
Meanwhile, officials are afraid that the number of victims could reach thousands, while the state agency for disaster relief states that access to the cities of Dongal, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
It is believed that the number of victims continues to grow as many bodies remain under the rubble, and many cannot be reached," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho's spokesman said.
The waves that reached the height and up to six meters devastated Pala, where a mass funeral will be held Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: Vehicles emergency assistance every minute of body imports.
The government of the missing water is clean.
Small shops are robbed all over the place."
Jean Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: The Red Cross of Indonesia is working hard to help the survivors, but we don't know what they're going to get there."
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesian President Yoko Widodo travelled to Pala on Sunday and instructed the army of that country: I ask you all to work all day to perform all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
Indonesia hit an earthquake in Lombok earlier this year in which more than 550 people were killed.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini reports that after a plane crash in the lagoon, one face is driven as missing.
The airline whose aircraft crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia reported that one face was run as missing, after it had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the plane that drowned.
Air Niugini in the statement states that since Saturday afternoon they are not able to follow the passenger.
The airline reports that in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and researchers are working to find this man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local vessels helped save other passengers and crew members after the plane fell into the water trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials announced on Friday that seven people were transferred to the hospital.
The airline reported that six more passengers were detained in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone was in stable condition.
It is still unclear what caused the fall and what was the exact outcome of the event.
Both the airline and the American Navy reported that the plane ended up in the lagoon without getting to the runway.
Some fathers think the plane flew over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
That's very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and the others managed to get through to the exit for a case of danger through the water that took them to the field in the plane that drowned.
He said the crew was panicking and screaming, and he suffered head injury.
The US Navy said that sailors working nearby at the port repair also helped save the boat by taking passengers to the shore before the plane sank at a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet).
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that in the accidents of the airlines registered in PNG for the past two decades, 111 people have died, but that none of them participated in Air Niugini.
The analyst reconstructed the incident on the night the woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the prosecution concluded a case in a retrial against a man accused of burning a live woman in Mississippi in 2014.
An analyst at the U.S. Ministry of Justice Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
In front of the jury, he said he used cell phone data to put together a picture of the movement of defendant Quinton Tellis, 29 years old, and victim Jessica Chambers, 19 years old, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he got location information from a few phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which is contrary to his earlier claims, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was in the same place as Chambersin at the time he was on his own claim with friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testifying on Saturday said he wasn't in town that day.
On the issue of whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed that Chambers met about two weeks before her death.
Cell phone records indicate they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett was that Tellis had deleted her messages, calls and contact information some time after Chambers' death from his phone.
He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense should begin on Sunday with the final words.
The judge said he expected that the trial before the jury would follow later in the day.
The High Breed: What's a bright hip-hop?
Hip-hop wants to try to challenge the negative attitude towards that genre by filling his compositions with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claims that the hip-hop was far away from its beginnings when dealing with political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and restore popularity to the enlightened hip-hop.
Artists like the Fugees and Commons are once again gaining popularity in Britain through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
The New York nanny is suing a couple for dismissal after a racist text message.
The New York nanny is suing a couple for dismissal on a discriminatory basis after having received a message from a mother who complains that she is another black person by mistake."
A few deny that they are racists, judging the charge as an exaggeration."
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, the mother of two children, showed a dissatisfaction when she realized that she was a new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, a black woman after her first day of work in 2016.
There's another black woman," Mrs. Plasco-Faxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending her to her wife, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
When she became aware of her boss, Plasco-Faxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that their former granddaughter, who was an African American, was doing her job badly and that instead of expecting her to be a Filipino, she was carrying New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one day's work and was sent home by the bar.
Maurice is now suing a couple for compensation for dismissal, as well as a fee of 350 dollars a day for six months, for how much she was originally engaged to live with her family, even without contract.
I want to show them, you see, you can't do such things," she said to Post on Friday, adding that I know it's discrimination."
A couple of charges of racism rebutted that the cancellation of Mauritian engagement was reasonable because they feared that after they offended her they would not be able to trust her.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," Joel Plasco's husband told Post.
But would you trust your children to whom you have offended, even if it was made a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Qualifying the lawsuit as an exaggeration," Plasco said his wife had only two months of absence and was in a very difficult situation."
Are you going to chase someone like that?
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still underway, the public court was quick to judge the money on social networks, criticizing them for such behavior and thinking.
The editors of Paddington were afraid that readers would not confess to the bear who spoke, the new letter was revealed.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says about the letter: It's hard to stand in the position of someone who reads it for the first time before the publication.
It's very interesting to know what we know now about Paddington's success."
Saying that her father, who, before the little bald bear inspired him to write a book for children, worked for the BBC as a cameraman, was still positive if his work was rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the book was filled with happiness and sorrow after his death last year.
She added that her father was secretly proud of Paddington, whom she described as a very important member of our family."
He was such a man, he didn't like to brag," she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if your child had achieved something and you were proud of him, even though it wasn't really your fault.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success in some way.
Although he was the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed all the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
Her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
He called over regularly to say it was bad, and they didn't expect to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called me to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
I did it, too.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, honey."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping blood slowly out of action and no longer flow through her bloodstream.
She died just a few moments before that and everything went off.
I could just sit there and wait, knowing what's next.
I couldn't scream, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be gathered."
At the end of the day, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who was now in mourning over the death of her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers who had not even dreamed of what pain she was going through.
No one knew," she said.
I moved my head, and my tears flowed down my face without stopping.
It's hard to explain, but over the years, I was overwhelmed by compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
The grieving women leave messages to prevent suicides on the bridge.
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide want to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humpeyes on the big bridge are putting cards with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he began suffering from depression to commit suicide at 18 years of age.
I don't want any parents to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis (45), who lives in Lydney, said her son was a prospective cook with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile would see every room."
But before he died, he left his job because he was in a very dark phase."
Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after this one committed suicide in 2014.
Mrs. Davis says, "I keep worrying about the consequences."
Mrs. Davis designed those cards so that people would know that there was someone you could contact and talk to, even if it was just a friend.
Don't sit down and shut up - talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, Mrs. Davis' long-term friend, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
He didn't say he was indisposed, depressed or anything else," she says.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
He was on the very bottom of Christmas when his children opened up their presents, and he did not look at them at all.
She says his death was a huge trauma to them, but they have to go through it: it leaves a huge void in the family.
That'll blow us up.
But we will continue and fight."

With the FBI investigation being opened, the future of Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain.
I thought that if we really managed to get something out of what he was looking for -- a limited duration and scope investigation -- maybe it would bring us together a little bit," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid the committee would fall apart" because of the restless side views.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their discontent is caused by the moment selection.
Elections for Congress take place for just five weeks, November 6th, and if Republicans go through bad, as expected, their attempts to elect their man in the highest court in the country will be seriously weakened.
George W. Bush called the senators on Saturday, lobbying for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes his report?
He will vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavneugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to decide by his vote and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of escapes from North Korea falls under Kim.
The number of crossings from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came into power seven years ago, the South Korean legislator said.
Calling for information from the Ministry of Unity of South Korea, Park Byeong-seug states that last year, 1127 escapes were recorded compared to 2011, when the figure was 2706.
Mr. Park said that two crucial factors are stronger border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs charged by smugglers.
Pyongyang didn't go public.
The vast majority of refugees from the north will eventually be offered South Korea citizenship.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Korean citizens have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most run across China, which has the longest border with South Korea and is easier to cross than a firmly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between two Koreas.
China considers the escapes to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often returns them.
Relations between the North and the South - which have been technically still in the war - have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang primarily to discuss ongoing negotiations on denuclearization.
This was followed by a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong in June in Singapore, on which a broad consensus was reached that it would work on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress so far.
Without trust in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances it does not mean that we are first disarming unilaterally," the RI said in its address to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bretta Kavanaugh hysterical," saying he was not good at serving in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh hysterical" and said that because of his temper he was uncomfortable for service in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help but think that if she ever acted like this, she would be hysterical," Pelosi said for her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his introduction, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost shouting and hugging when he spoke about his family and his high school years,
He also explicitly condemned the democrats in the committee, assessing the indications of a grotesque and orchestrated attack on his personality" who organised to get angry at Hilary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not perform a function in the Supreme Court because it showed his bias towards the damage of the democrat.
I believe he is disqualifying himself with such statements and the way he went against the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
The question is whether he will try to revoke Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if the Democrats get the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi is silent.
I'll say next - if he doesn't tell the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he's not like not only to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he's in now," Pelosi said.
Kavanugh is currently a judge of District Columbia District District Appeals Court.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about any Kavanaughi judgements against the Access to Health Protection Act or in Roe's case against Wade, as he was considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions as to whether he would change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to be put in court and we are expected to say if that is not wonderful," Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
A justified anger, anger that has been gathered for months and years, and it cannot be solved without payment.
We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steine told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, what do you say?"
She went on to say, "I was helped by a woman who was an executive director somewhere, and who said that she also cried when she was angry, but that she developed a technique that she used to say that when she was angry and started to cry, the person she was going to talk to said that you might think I was sad because I was crying.
I'm angry."
And then I'd just keep going.
And I thought she was great."
The tears are allowed to shed anger in part and because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of the previous job, in the office where most of the men were, is how, once I cried because of an undescriptive anger, an older woman -- the cold boss I always had a little scared -- grabbed me by the neck and pulled me out of the stairs.
I never let them see me crying," she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy because they think they've hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
When in 1987, Hart was caught in an out-of-court affair on a Monkey Business ship and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, discovered that there was no reason to consider the idea of running for the president himself.
That wasn't a well-thought decision," she said 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone called it Snowman and seven bats."
Since the campaign was already slowed down, she was lagging behind with the fundraiser, so she swore she wouldn't be in the race if she didn't collect $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave her $1,000 would give her a total of $250.
Do they think I have a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude for the people who supported her, by frustration over the system that made it difficult for her to raise funds and target voters instead of their representatives, and by anger over shovinism - from which she was drawn.
You'd think I'd experienced a nervous breakdown," recalled Mrs. Schroeder how the press reacted to her.
You'd think Kleinex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what they're gonna put in my memory?
She's crying."
How a trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The first cannons of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and until the end of the battle is seen, the gap between countries can be of long-term benefit to Beijing, hard experts.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, issued the first warning at the beginning of this year by taxing key Chinese export articles including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest hit occurred this week with new tariffs that hit items worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), which almost taxed half of all goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing returned each time with the same measure, and the latest introduction of tariffs is from five to ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed that the United States will respond with the same measure, and the second largest world economy seems not to stop soon.
To urge Washington to withdraw means to satisfy the demands, but public worship to the United States would be too unpleasant for Xi Jinping, Chinese President.
However, experts claim that if Beijing plays its next move well, U.S. pressure to trade war can sustain China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the beginning of a steep downturn in one of the two countries is actually much more dangerous than the observers believed," said Abigail Grace, a researcher whose focus is Asia at the Centre for New American Security.
Syria is ready to return refugees, the Foreign Minister says.
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in rebuilding a country torn down by war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
Today the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas that have destroyed terrorists to restore normal life.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that were focused on their daily life and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the damaged country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional help or help from countries that had helped the rebellion.

The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all rounds, and became one of the four players who have ever reached 5-0-0 since the 1997 tournament started in this format.
American Jordan Speith lost 5-4 from Throbjorn Olesen from Denmark, the lowest ranking player of the European team.
The world's best-ranking player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 by Ian Poulter from England who might have been Ryder's last buy.
A veteran with eight Ryder purchases, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the best European tournament winner of all times from the 25.5 points in his career.
I don't usually cry, but I couldn't hold back today.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy, I'm very happy that we won the buy again.
Here is an important team and I am glad that I could be of help," emotional Garcia said after a European victory.
He's handing over to his countryman John Rama who won the legendary American golfer Tiger Woods 2 to 1 in a single match on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud of winning Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at that man," 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds a 13-21-3 career record at Ryder's.
Extraordinary statistics for one of the best players of all time who won 14 greatest titles and is only left behind Jack Nicklus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find its way to the hole, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the top golf course throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of his team, American captain Jim Furik said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we provided resistance to Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking off Thomas' hat.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder team to buy and move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to admit who's better.
We're overrated."
