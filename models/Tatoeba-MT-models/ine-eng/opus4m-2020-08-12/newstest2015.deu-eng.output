The Prime Minister of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi has met with his first important foreign visit since his election in May to discuss economic and security relations with his Japanese colleague Shinzo Abe.
Mr Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic relations with the third largest economic nation in the world.
Plans for greater nuclear cooperation are on the agenda.
According to reports, India also hopes for a defence cooperation agreement between the two nations.
Police from Karratha arrested 20 years after fast motorbike hunting
A motorcycle was seized after the driver had driven it in a 70 km/h zone and through Buschland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after they had observed it leaving it at 125 km/h a tank station on the Bathdate Road.
The police report that the driver then ignored the signals and continued on the Burgess Road before he moved to Buschland, where the officers lost sight of it.
The bike and a person who matched the description of the driver were later seen at a house in Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
The police of Karratha accused a 20-year-old man of neglecting a stop signal and reckless driving.
He will appear in Karratha on September 23rd before the Court of Justice.
The motorcycle was secured and seized for three months.
George Webster for hotel rapes in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is in court for rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was sued at a hearing of the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of having raped a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on 7 June 2013.
The accusation is that Webster attacked her, while she was "conscious, slept, and couldn't signal any understanding."
Webster is also asked to rape a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim, Scotland, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set up the negotiating deadline for the 17th of November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Returning to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade unions as citizens' rights.
"As trade unions die, middle class jobs also die," said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota and deputy president of the Progressive Caucus Congress.
That is why I am proud to present the Staff Authorisation Act, together with the citizen's lawyer John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination on account of the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-communicated forces.
The addition of the national labour law to create an opportunity for workers exposed to discrimination to organise a trade union representative in order to appeal to a civil court for justice - and to receive compensation or penalties - is a meaningful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - certainly not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way is to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill propose, the connection back to a very American idea.
Despite the backlogs the trade unions have been exposed to in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries throughout the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, extend and respect labour rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in a breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militarized autocracy of Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full awareness that workers and their trade unions played a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "the rights of workers to unity and joint negotiations and actions are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff forced the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that fascism was replaced by strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that workers would have to organize and raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans introduced a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations in order to ensure and improve working and economic conditions is guaranteed to each individual and every profession or profession.
Agreements which restrict or aim to reduce this right are null and void; measures aimed at this are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the chairmanship over the International Commission on Human Rights, from which the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was designed, as it was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join unions to protect his interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When this country tells other countries how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans stated that the right to establish a trade union - and that this trade union could then participate in collective negotiations as an equal partner with companies and government bodies - must be protected.
After the rights in America have been exercised, it is indeed very wise to return to the American ideal, so that the working population must have the right to unite and be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers' movement did not restrict the strength of the nation but increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, work has created a wonderful market for industry and has raised the whole nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but the story preserves them.
History remembers, and so should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representations - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that America has made in the past and have redeemed the promise of democracy.
Judge stops temporary law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close
On Sunday, a U.S. judge temporarily stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, from which the lawyer said it would probably have led to the closure of all five state abortion clinics.
This measure, taken by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June and due to enter into force on 1 September, would force doctors performing abortions to obtain a patient admission right at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles in order to acquire their practice.
The judge's decision, however, means that doctors may continue to perform legal abortions temporarily while applying for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law, while they strive to achieve these rights," federal judge John deGravelles wrote in his judgment.
Within one month, a hearing shall be held for the judge in order to make a more lasting decision for the law.
Decommissioners welcomed the decision, the latest in a number of similar judgments, and said that doctors had gained so much time to obtain hospital education rights.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana avoid a maintenance law that wants to take their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and president of the Centre for Reproduction Rights, who had complained on behalf of three of the five state clinics to stop the law.
It was not directly clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the complaint and also applied for the right of admission.
Louisiana is one of the 11 States that have adopted similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures in Alabama and Mississippi not constitutionally.
Key points of a law in Texas, which had forced most of the clinics left in the state to close, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Doctors and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association agree that the right of admission of doctors requires unnecessary restrictions.
Disposals prevent measures from being used to protect women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of clinical closure.
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient rights, the Centre for Reproduction Rights shared with him.
If all the other doctors in the state were forced to do no more abortions, this doctor would fear that his safety would no longer carry out the operation, the group said.
When they argued against the judgment, the State representative of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for performing abortions, while their applications would still depend on patient rights.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment options result in higher rates of death due to ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video tribute to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in rural Australia there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1,100 Australian women in which ovarian cancer was detected in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after the diagnosis.
Research Director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
SMALL STUDENTS: New medicines may slow lung and ovary cancer
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, existing diseases, and social and economic status also affected the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancers were already further advanced at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20% higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not examine why women living outside the city die with a higher probability of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspected a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and they are usually found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services in order to counter the removals, she proposed, as possible, a strengthening of the service of infected doctors to allow specialists to provide women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study, regardless of geographical status, provided a poor long-term survival rate for women in ovarian cancer and stressed the need for better treatment and care strategies.
The study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is today published in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisa Neave, a 33-year-old mother from the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres regret lowering household numbers
The decrease, together with an increased decline in the number of households under 35, could result in ten thousand pounds per year being lost by garden centres when today's young consumers, according to a study by the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times, reach the "Kernalt Group for Garden Products".
The report says that tenants spend on average 55 percent of the amount that people with own homes spend on their garden.
The increase in people living in highly urbanised areas without gardens, the popular method of asphalting parks, and the decreasing garden size are other factors threatening the industry, in which the estimated 5 billion £ are sold annually.
In London, where the proportion of household owners from 61 to 43 per cent has fallen over a period of 6 years, the lowest expenditure for garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that homes for rent or small gardens do not mean that people cannot plant.
Guy Barter, RHS Chief Garden Adviser, said: "Container gardeners are very popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants when they move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retail trade due to increasing household ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also forecasted an improved market situation for this year due to better weather according to unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and the spiritual Tahirul Qadri, continues.
In the capital of Islamabad, about 1,000 demonstrators have hit the state television PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings again.
The broadcaster submitted his operation for about 40 minutes, but is now sending it back.
At the same time, some 3,000 demonstrators tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Navaz Sharif.
About a kilometer away, they supplied with pieces and stones equipped with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators demanded Sharif's resignation, but he denies it.
The army of the country therefore recalls a political solution to the conflict "without time and without violence".
After a meeting in the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said, "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state".
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already played a more frequent role.
Opposition politician Imran Khan proposes that Prime Minister Sharif have cheated on the parliamentary elections last May.
The protests were escalated at the end of the week after Khan and Qadri had summoned their supporters to move to Sharif's residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey orders US diplomat for spying reports
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has commissioned the country's oldest US diplomats to learn about a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said that the businessman of the US Embassy and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine The mirror and the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former US analysts of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a major area of activity for US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was playing down the importance of the report and said that all important countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report that the most important secret service in Germany had in the visa was that of the Turkish government.
Warning: Drivers threaten with consequences for Pendler
On Monday evening, the national driver's warning line could also affect passenger transport in NRW.
The period from 6 p.m. to 21 p.m. is extended to all transport companies in the country, including remote, regional and S-Bahn transport,
The main direction of the warning line is freight transport.

said the district president of the German Lokomotivführer (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We're counting on significant accidents.
There are no regional priorities.
The main direction of the warning line is freight transport.
The Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything in its power to keep the effects as low as possible.
However, the GDL has not said where they want to strike, so it is difficult to predict the consequences concretely.
Police chief of magalup of corruption charged
On Friday, the prosecutors presented to the Office of the Attorney General of Mallorca evidence of police and police repression in the city of Calvià.
The chief of the police of Calvià on the island of Mallorca was arrested after corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious binge drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Commissioner-in-chief José Antonio Navarro was arrested in an investigation by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of the bars and nightclubs of Magaluf are located.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of police and police repression to the State Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guard Civil in connection with the corruption projects and were questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that the angry night club owners said that the authorities’ veterinary business had a serious impact on their business.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about surviving," one of the businessmen told the court.
Let our base of life out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf did this summer due to a viral YouTube video, which showed an 18-year-old British tourist who performed 24 men during a souftour Fellatio.
The island authorities have since tried to stop the improper behaviour of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimising the number of participants in the notorious alcohol-drinked bottlenecks.
The Playhouse Club, in which the Fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for one year, while Playhouse and the Kneipentour organizer Carnage together had to pay a penalty of € 55,000 (US$ 73,000).
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British vacationers, is also known for several accidents under alcohol influence, including the trend of "balconing", when people jump from one balcony to another or from one balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The FRUHLING has provided South Australia with a winter surprise, with severe sights and strong wind, which affected flights from Adelaide Airport.
At night until 21:00, another 5mm of rain fell on the city, after 6,6mm, which had already fallen on the night to Sunday.
The last crash was the result of a series of short, stormy sights, including a gust that began just 20 hours ago and provided almost 4mm of precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After the last week of winter had provided an early dose of spring, the temperatures in the city again fell to a maximum of only 15.8°C on Monday.
The following weather conditions have probably led to the delayed landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7.30 p.m., but was hit by a sudden change of wind speed or direction over a short distance and had to continue.
Windfalls reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft also had to proceed on a second land trip and was finally set up at about 8.40 p.m.
The delay led to the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a quantum flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16°C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible sights.
Matthews says: Maximum time for large networking
In view of the glamorous technical progress that threatens to turn our comfortable home into high-tech switching centers, our columnist Bernd Matthias is comforted with an extremely trusted electronic accessory.
While I'm writing this here, my look at the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think, "Boah, how retro is that?"
But there is a reflection behind it: If the cable were not, in the shortest time, all the listeners would fly around the house without fear, and that would be much more retro.
Nonetheless, does it apply to the electronic (electronic)?
No, tip error: electronic sector the rule that the world's news of today's electrical waste of tomorrow has been purchased - obsolete.
And for example, who still has a tube TV in the living room today, who just says that he basically rejects television.
Why these considerations?
Because ifa's interference at the radio tower this week brings us back our absolute incompetence in electronics issues.
The Lai, who was blind to previous washing machines and CD players, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread to him with inconceivable inexplicable expertise: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press station.
Yeah, are you okay?
What should be discussed with people who are apparently willing to expand such a quark?
Basically, it has been about 20 years, especially since we were supposed to connect our house.
In order for the Joghurt to check himself to inform us on the Maldives holiday that it is burning in the working room.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we left the office from the air conditioning on our arrival soon ...?
Yes, however, this presupposes an air conditioning system.
But a dream is sure to come true soon: We raise our bracelet, you say "Saigen!" - and the dust robot runs home.
Irree.
Everything goes on nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are floating," a industry expert rounds, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steam generator sends the weather report and the data glasses show how long the pizza in the oven still needs, but nothing is useful because we are in the barn.
We also know from the daily practice that if a new fashionable device is used once really urgently, the battery is guaranteed empty.
What is another reason why the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio shows.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in airspace, while rocket and mortar shelling landed on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools in Gaza remained closed, while the area recovered from the battles.
The start of the school brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities drawn by rocket launchers in southern Israel, but the signs of the struggle are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, a staff member of the "Passosh" child garden, who was hit by a rocket, before the student came across the grenades from the walls and slides.
"We're a little scared, but we're excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and a English teacher there.
Many children in our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it feels "a little funny" to go back to school.
"It was difficult times, and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the border to Gaza to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire last week, thousands of border communities like Saad left their homes or left their homes to move further away from Gaza in safe areas and to leave the rocket and mortar fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a village near the border to Gaza, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian butcher grenade, still hesitated with the return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a border city in Gaza, which is heavily marked by the Palestinian coup.
He called on the children to learn a lot and said "We will ensure that you acquire knowledge and provide security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire provided for an immediate end to the fight; however, important problems remain unresolved, such as the Hamas claim after the Israeli-Egypt blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the airport and seaports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the disarmament of Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in battle.
A new round of indirect conversations is likely to begin in Egypt this month.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children according to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel disputes these data and estimates that it is at least half of those killed to be combatants, but did not provide any concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar grenades at Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and endure the struggles, the educational authorities moved last week to the beginning of the school year.
"I hope that the school will soon be reopened so that we can continue to learn, like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
After election in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl asks NPD-prohibiting procedures
In view of the loss of voting by the NPD in Saxony, the CDU-Fundesvise Thomas Strobl has spoken before the Federal Constitutional Court for an end of the ongoing NPD-ban procedure.
Berlin - According to the CDU-Bundesvise Thomas Strobl, the ongoing banning proceedings against the NPD should end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD cuts off worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also the head of CDU in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a happy development in the right direction and a development that will rather lead me to the conclusion that we are fighting the NPD politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD failed at the five-percent curtain on Sunday's vote.
A first start for a ban on the right-wing party was failed in 2003 because the constitutional protection at that time also had informants at the NPD summit.
In December 2013, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe after long preparation.
The Federal Government and the Federal Day do not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
In the new country, there are refugees now being accommodated in tents.
The central first reception for refugees in Harburg is made from all the nude.
Now the internal authority has set up three tents of the red cross.
District politicians were informed just before - they are not excited.
"These Hauruck actions continue to increase the public's reservations and do not allow district politicians to participate constructively in the human settlements of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, Group Chairman of the Greens at the Harburg District Assembly.
Her party claims that the district administration of Harburg currently provides uninhabited houses for accommodation.
96 Refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for the overrun in the first take-off are the distress of applicants - and the fact that the authorities are not able to provide sufficient seats in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
Household prices have experienced the strongest winter rise in seven years, showing a largely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for households in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 percent in August, so the RP data from Monday.
As a result of this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months until August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
The research director of RP Data, Tim Lawless, announced that Sydney and Melbourne are operating a two-part market.
The figures of RP Data show that household prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 per cent last year, compared with 11.7 per cent in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, in which prices increase on average by five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was hit hard by the cuts in government expenditure and where prices per year only increase by 1.4 per cent.
Mr Lawless further said that with the beginning of spring, an increase would be observed for the next few months in the properties for sale that would be subject to the market "a real test".
"When considering the constant high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the constantly low interest environment, it is likely that domestic prices will continue to increase over the next three months," he said.
In an opinion to the New Press, he contradicts the statements of CEO Peer Medau and certifies him to pose "like a fieldman".
The style of the university is not that, it is said in the Communication.
So the Medau family has already been informed orally about the institution of the University in mid-June.
The statement that the plans were only known in July is definitely wrong," Pötzl said.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "preventions or even decisions", but there are "preferences".
Also the expansion of the narrow road necessary for access to the castle is less dramatic than the Medaus.
It was from a nine-metre wide street and it's not the talk.
It goes to the current state of 5.50 meters, which is a meter wider than before," explains Pötzl.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and schooly parking areas in the future will then only be used by students at the university, will not allow Pötzl to apply.
It is not parked at all because it can be solved intelligently, as in other public parking spaces.
Think of the People
According to the University President, the children's skirmish of Bergwichtel, which is located on the ground and whose door would lead to access to the parking deck, is "not affected".
Rather, he has to think, "that this is not only about the children's scratches, but also about the residents at the entrance to the Friedrich Streib Street and the 800 students of the neighbouring real school.
So it is much more than the particular interests of Mr Medau," Pötzl said.
Whether the criticism of the parental advice of the children's scratches, with the expansion of the street would be justified "to lose a few natural spots of Coburg" or "the reader can decide for himself".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the State Bauamt Bamberg, will inform the city of the construction development of the University by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new resolution".
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the children's scratches last week about the plans of the university.
Therefore, the access to the new parking deck should not lead, as before, to the campus and the Friedrich-Steib-straße, but to the Medau-Berg.
This meant that the narrow road would have to be expanded to about a kilometer in length twice.
According to the averages of the bear, traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would be forgiven.
Of about 2000 vehicles per day is the talk.
On the side of the city, it was not intended to speak to the project until now.
Glandorf returns from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old SG Flensburg-Handewitt of the Federal League raised health problems for this decision.
I don't like the decision. It's over a few months.
It is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and finish my career in the national team," the 2007 World Champion told me on his Facebook page.
Thus, it goes with a balance sheet of 167 national games and 576 gates for Germany in international rest.
Because the heavy-duty backroom player for the Flensburg Champions League wants to go to Torejagd for a few more years, he is now no longer available to the new Federal Coach Dagur Sigurdsson.
With Iceland, which announced its framework for the national games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf conducted a "long and good conversation".
His ideas and approaches have as thrilled me as they will delight my long-standing fellow players and my successors.
But for my club, I also want to be healthy in the coming years, for which longer regeneration breaks are needed, which do not allow the current double load.
The left hand had to be afraid of his career after a television infection in 2012.
Because of Achillesian problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Band (DHB) with a cortisone syringe, which later triggered a strong inflammation.
A not operation and two other interventions followed.
Then Glandorf announced a complaint against the team doctor, which ended the dispute with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team careers don't pass without a trace.
I have some health facilities that I can't ignore anymore.
After the three infection-related foot operations that took place in 2012, I never got my blood pressure right in the grip.
There are some other complaints of wear and tear.
Already at the beginning of the year, I noticed that although I control my head, my body can't cheat," Glandorf explained in the interview to the magazine "Handball Time".
For a comeback he would only be available in the absolute emergency.
"When all the sticks are ready, I'm always ready to talk," explained the two-time family father to the specialist magazine.
However, I can count on one hand the years in which I can still play handball.
I also have to say that after my long stay in the hospital in 2012, I have also become quite humble as regards my health.
After my career, I want to be able to go at least some way straight.
In addition to the WM title 2007 and the win of the 2014 Champions League, he won the 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo) the EHF Pokal.
In 2012, he also secured with Flensburg the European Cup of Pokal winners.
German economy decreased by 0.2 per cent in spring
The crises around the globe have slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
The gross domestic product decreased by 0.2 per cent from April to the end of June 2014.
This was shared by the Federal Statistical Office and confirmed provisional calculations.
The economy experienced consumption alone in the spring, while the investments decreased.
Foreign trade also slowed down the economy.
Thanks to the strong year-on-year rise, the total GDP plus 0.8 per cent for the first half of the year is compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and goal of the "Monsterland-Mooiste", which led through the castle on Sunday for the first time.
On Sunday, the Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch riders.
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, held the so-called "Münsterland-Mooiste".
This is the biggest bike tour through Münster, the bike paradise near the Netherlands.
Over 1,000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for the organisation of this tour through Münster.
Published in various journals, this tour was offered to interested people.
We come from The Light and are driven by night to take part in this tour.
We also want to get to know Münster in this way once more," the bikers were delighted to see the route through the Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld districts.
After registering at the Vereinsheim der Schützbrüderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace trip" through the city over the Wall, where it also started.
The route, which was written out for three different categories, further led towards Herrenholz over the Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld and over Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On lines of 95 kilometres with 1175 meters in height, 120 kilometres with 1475 meters in height and 145 kilometres with 1775 meters in height, the riders proved their good condition.
They were cared for on the way to Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Chief organizer Jos ter Huerne and Deputy Mayor Heinz Lölfing were very pleased about the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all participants.
The organization was left without problems and there were no negative events," Heinz Lölfing draws a positive picture of this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants as the organizer had hoped, what was likely about the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We will see each other again in 2015 in the hopeful weather on August 30, or during another weekend," however, the bikers promised to return to Münster and the organizers are planning a new edition.
Konstantin Wecker's undeniably honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which has brought Constantine Wecker, singer, pacifist, political activist, ex-prisoner, to paper on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thoughtsets for thoughtsets, the Municher, born on June 1, 1947, wrote his memoirs, each chapter was introduced by an appropriate lyrics.
And he's honest with himself: From the Onania as a gymnasist to the theft and drug consumption, he doesn't let out any human weakness.
Also to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow humans.
Wide space also takes abstract but more important terms: Love, soul, ego, Being in Now, Spirituality - all of which he tries to go on the ground, in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also how not only did he express his music (the opera lover became the soul and rock musician) but also his stay in prison.
The latter also brought Lebemann Konstantin Wecker closer to the Ascetic monk, who "produces by abstraction", as he says, "by leaving everything unnecessary".
However, among all the high-spirited views there are also short anecdotes to the earth: for example, about beatings in a local area attended by GIS or a vantage point where he pointed forward to a tree.
Even there he is unswervingly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me into his arms.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry tries for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was created from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult moments of childhood.
He visited "many" therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry is thinking about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, just heard his voice: "Stop with your hand.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who had grown up when I was a child - went to the nest with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket blow.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Most of my life he was this most serious guy in the corner who read the paper.
Henry recently opened a fire department in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than his father’s, he gained an insight into how life must have been for him.
It's a little brighter now, but they're dark, spicy, deep stygical labyrinths with flames and smoke and a lot of rust.
My father used to lie in the bathtub and then he was slowly heard as he began to sing because he could wash himself.
When I went around there, it became clear to me that he had done this for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him increased.
Still, Henry grew up as a child without his parents' expressions of love.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you".
Only when my mother went bad against the end of her life will we begin to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Did you ever stop "I love you" with that?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
He is still friends with French, with whom he has been married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said "You must be radical.
So I went through this fitness and I also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And it's hard.
Nobody likes karotene.
Henry's career shift may show up in his elegant, short-cut bar.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he is taken from the theater.
It followed the comedy of the errors, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have fulfilled his business life.
He started at only 16 when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote about him to New Faces.
His television career began in the middle of the 1970s. "I was the only black copyist/Comedian on TV for a quite long time."
He learned in the profession.
Not only did I have to grow up before the eyes of the public, but I also learned from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient joke-telling machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the stage rights at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "painted black", Henry introduced his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I kind of wish it never happened, but I don't regret that I did.
It was a unique, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "year-long award-winning light column of British television" was also a "big parody of black people."
By introducing figures that ridiculed the British black culture as well as celebrated, Henry worked in the Eighties on an alternative comedy circle.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show went on mission in 1984, and in the nineties he was known among others as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the Comedyserie Chef!
Advertising, documentary films, TV series, and film roles marked his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008 he thought, "What are you doing next, Len, because it feels so much like you're just taking the time out or getting a little in place?"
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 with the title What's So Great About ...?
The first sequence was about Shakespeare.
I was usually allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him in school and kept him mainly for a middle class domain, white in stockings and a coalhead in front.
So I was very afraid of it.
All those we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "You should try it once.
Don't make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few words in your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry made 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary film and he was thrilled.
I felt like I could do this.
It was almost as if someone had finally put my head right.
"That's why it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, research a little bit.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and it just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of the errors.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had to entertain the audience.
"A small voice said to me, "You have to cross 10 minutes now while they repair the computer."
Instead, the stage director announced that the show continued as soon as the problem was solved.
I went off the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for this.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, which strengthens the tendons.
That also came well, so it's like a great shield of the gods who say to me, "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a DONNER voice.
So I'm staying.
I really love that.
I love being in a sample room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation has gone through humourful outbursts, while he still imitates people.
I have decided not to make stand-up comedy because I find that this kind of immediate satisfaction from a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you're always looking for that, you're driving in front of a wall.
I sometimes act live in the Apollo when I want to, but I don't have as much as I used to.
I'm asking him if he's ever gonna make a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to form a beginning, a middle part and the end of a journey - I don't think I want to give it up again and again.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block streets in Yemen capital
In the conflict between Shitish Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, Huthis has called for civil disobedience in the capital of Sanaa.
Huthi adherents occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, said a spokesperson for the Huthi party "Ansar Allah".
Access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemeni media report a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Huthi-Führer Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called for action on Sunday.
Huthi threatened the sheet with a further escalation of the conflict, according to reports, his demands should not be met.
The Scythian Huthis are fighting for more independence from Sunni Yemen and are calling for the government's resignation.
The people's tribe of Huthi has been covering the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
About 30,000 rebels have set up protest camps on the great access roads of Sanaa.
In the surrounding area, there are always bloody fights with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registers officers to imprison "spirited"
Kenya has thus begun to register all state officials biometrically to remove "spirit employees" from the government's salary lists.
Employees who did not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, a government announcement said.
The government assumes that thousands of people are still receiving payouts even after their separation from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised his entry in 2013 to fight corruption in the public service.
In a review at the beginning of this year, it was found that at least $1 million (€700,000) per month had been lost in payments for "spirit employees" and other abuses of financial practices.
The government assumes that fees will continue to be paid on accounts after a person dies or leaves the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports to the BBC from the capital of Nairobi.
All officials must now appear in identification centres within the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric records are recorded, a government notice has been issued.
All those who would not do this without a credible apology would be removed from the payroll, the communication continued.
"This process will contribute significantly to the rationalisation of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also adjusting the payroll at both levels of government - the "spirit employees" are eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, Cabinet Secretary at the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal involving the art advisor Helge Achenbach is first negotiated before the court on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, the son of the founder of Aldi Theo Albrecht, claim in a civil proceedings at the Düsseldorf Landgericht 19.4 million Euro damages from Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings.
This was shared by a judge on Monday.
In the complaint it is said that Achenbach cheated on the purchase of works of art and old-timers and Berthold Albrecht calculated higher than the actual purchase prices paid.
As a result, the agreed commission was also higher.
Achenbach has purchased worth 121 million euros for Albrecht.
Children need roots and wings
He was 44 years old at school, 23 of whom were school leaders.
From this time on, Manfred Richter knows many famous Petershauser and Kollbacher from their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always carried by his efforts to see people in the school.
The snowflake is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motive of his home.
Judge was born in 1930 in Trautenau/Nordböhmen, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he was interested in higher education for the teacher profession after four years.
A year later, the Sudet Germans were exposed.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bayern in 1946 - in the freight car.
That's how it killed a judge in the Upper-Francian Lower Village.
The teacher's training took place in Bamberg.
Manfred Richter had to walk six times a week to the next train station, take the train to Bamberg, go three kilometers across the city to school and return at night.
After two months Manfred Richter was given a bedtime in a Red Cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 students in a bedroom.
In 1951 he did the first and after three years of teaching, the second state exam.
Since Oberfranke had no free school for him, he applied for Oberbayern and came to the school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The "Fruulein-Zimmer" was his first "duty" in the schoolhouse.
In 1958 he referred to a three-room service in the newly built Teacher House next to the school.
This house was purchased by Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school was dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the Petershausen-Kollbach school band and five in Petershausen.
Since the school year 1968/69, these have been summarised in Peterhausen in today's Council.
When Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in place.
To avoid a retiring in the now smaller school, then Principal Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so from September 1982 the children and their teachers were able to relate to today's construction, which was extended after Judge's retirement in 1997.
Manfred Richter commends the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who also built a workshop at the municipal cost and at the 1997 extension, although this was not eligible under the guidelines for school buildings.
"Citizen Master Götz was very school-friendly," Judge recalled gratefully.
In his entire career, Manfred Richter never forgot the speech of a government representative who had responded to a report from a school council on justice and justice: "You must never forget love." Manfred Richter put on what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two kinds: roots and birds," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to find out, "It doesn't always work out." Whether he only thinks of his students or his own six children, it's not quite clear.
In any case, Justice's action was sometimes unconventional.
When the students got into a fight, they didn't get a criminal job from him, and they didn't get divorced.
At the expense of the municipality, judges had two pair of boxing shoes purchased and allowed the two contractors to join each other, even though there should be a fork.
For the benefit of the school, judges maintained a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved the partisan judge after his retirement to at least in 1996 as the last candidate on the CSU list for the municipality.
But judges were elected to six and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 bike drivers put in the spa park of Bad Salthausen and Shots Interstops
When Radler makes a toast on her tour in Bad Salthausen or Shotten Rast, this is nothing special.
On Friday, however, only the number of rockings was impressive: the 700 participants of the h4-Radtour and accompanying tross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under free sky in the Scottish Alteburg Park.
Under the motto "Raddle and celebrate on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig" the participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and there a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it was serious: the bikers took the first stage, the 60 km over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Shoten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes of Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started with the bike in Bad Vilbel, were welcomed by the head of the company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
In order to refresh the body and spirit, all sorts of good things were prepared: the rural women from Ranstadt and Lower-Mockstadt had 85 sheets of apples, twins, strawberries and cheese cakes that were wonderfully served by the cyclists.
"These cakes can only be baked by women," said a participant from Aulendiebach, while he ordered another piece.
Cold refreshments could be created at the drinking level of the tournament Geist-Nidda.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained the visitors with famous melodies from operas and musicals and generated enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful atmosphere of the park seemed relaxing.
One gentleman added a head massage by his partner: "He earned it, finally he has re-assembled bicycle chains already running today".
Meanwhile, the mayor and the manager still had to work: they were interviewed at the well in front of the drink shop by reporter Rainer Janke and took advantage of the opportunity to advertise in the radio for bathrooms.
Also, the head of promotion Tobias Hagen, since the first h4-Radtour 2004 as a tour guide, could only take a short look, but he had plenty to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated by means of three telephones and a radio device with his employees and the 15-headed Hessen police bike board, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from wells or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus, and even from many cities in Westphalia, bike drivers are involved.
The number of participants is limited to the available accommodation capacity.
In Category I, participants are accommodated in hotels, in Category II in collective accommodation.
From the resort, the bikers had a good impression when they broke up again after a half hour: "Chüss!"
"It was nice in bathrooms!" they said goodbye.
After arrival in Scotland, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening, the cyclists were required in the idyllic Alteburg park.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and City Marketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful solid environment and of course had prepared deliciouss, such as flammable cakes with a well-cooled spring white.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC President Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs, in his capacity as Board member of ADAC Hessen-Thüringen, welcomed visitors.
The three were apparently pleased with the "many operations in bulkheads".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity to swirl under free sky was used zealously despite the sporting activity on the bike.
Among the guests were increasingly mixed citizens, who were just as motivated by the good mood as were the great crowd of riders.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwalders - were on the program.
Yesterday, after 180 km of Radelns, the athletes met again in Bad Vilbel.
Thousands of Turkish police officers arrested for "sworn" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey due to suspicion of "conspiracy against the government", local media agencies reported.
The police authorities did not comment directly.
Among those arrested are 14 high-ranking policemen, says Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government employees, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish policemen were arrested for allegedly establishing an organised criminal association and calling telephone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described her actions as part of the activities led by the Islamic spiritual Fethulla Gullen against him and others in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (September 1st) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had been reopened, however he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful anywhere in Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukow, head of the school in Slavjansk, visiting Jazenjuks' daughter, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally prevail here again and that children will receive an education that will be useful to them in their future lives.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, while the children wear shirts, hold balloons in their hands and give their teachers flowers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It meets with a proud reputation from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory Party.
And she has her own experience.
Her career began with the global management consulting company Bain and Co., where she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and Pearsons' media.
She was the chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and retired when Pearson's senior position on a younger male colleague.
Its discovery allegedly amounted to almost £1 million.
Her political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended by David Cameron of Lord Browne, the former president of BP, when he sought out more private knowledge in Whitehall: she became a consultant in the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory Council member.
Already in May, I described the President's task with a poisoned throat.
Not only is the BBC a huge and complex unity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust is in two directions: after inside the first guard of its own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outside as a voice of public concern and worry when things go wrong.
This ensures an almost unsustainable duopol that requires a comprehensive reform.
But which new president would risk, join, engage and separate an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he may be doing his job himself.
It's a difficult task.
And if that wasn't enough, many are still interested in seeing the BBC less - power, money and status out of control.
While competition is getting closer and new technologies threaten old, comfortable security, the upcoming negotiations on license fees for BBC are linked to special dangers.
For the modest sum of £145.50 per year, the British public will certainly become the world's largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 percent of all households and costs only 40 pence per day.
And it seems that the BBC on the popularity scale is going up again: 53 percent support today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines today on my phone and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But she remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a remarkable president - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that detachment tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official user account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday, contained a derogatory remark about the democratic district attorney, who is at the centre of a criminal charge against him for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another by Perry's user account, which removed the previous one.
Just a tweet from my account was sent out, which was not authorized by me.
"I don't buy the tweet and deleted it," it said in the subsequent message.
Perry's employees did not respond immediately to questions about comments.
Although the tweets of Perry's official user account went off, it was not clear who actually served the feed.
In the previous tweet, an unfavourable image of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted in April 2013 of drunkenness at the tax.
Perry filed a veto against a financial promotion of her office when she refused to return, which led to an indictment against Perry - which could possibly be 2016 presidential candidate - before a Grand jury this month in Austin.
The text of the tweet reads: "I don't always drive drunk with the three-fold permissible alcohol mirror ... but when I do it, I complain to Governor Perry when he uploads it."
I'm the drunkest democrat in Texas.
Lehberg's office was not entrusted with the management of the Grand Jury's investigation against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special state attorney from San Antonio, who was elected by a Republican judge.
Perry complained about not guilty and called the charge a political trick.
His high-ranking team of law enforcement officers asked the judge in charge of the case to reject the charge and argued that the law against the oldest governor in the history of the state of Texas was unconstitutional.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state money to the State's Public Integrity Unit - based in Travis County and established in cases of State corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to retire.
This veto provided for a public complaint by a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After finishing his presidential candidacy in 2012 at the Iowa elections, Perry went on speculations that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself at the jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we come!"
Berkeley explains apartment market again for "normal"
One of London's most prominent construction contractors pointed out that the apartment market in southeastern England was once again "returned" to normal level.
Ownerships in the capital were keen and subject to huge price increases, which caused the Bank of England, due to the widespread fear of a credit bubble, to set upper limits for mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the top-class construction company Berkeley said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has been back to normal transaction levels since the 2013 peak" and added that this provides a "stable operating environment".
The real estate market in London was well established during the decommissioning, as foreign buyers were forced into the capital.
According to information from the disaster department, prices in the city area alone rose by 18.5 percent last year, much more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
The average sales prices for Berkeley's private, priced and student offerings increased by about one fifth last year and were at the end of April by £423,000.
However, a stronger pound has made real estate less attractive in London for foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been intimidated by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric about a possible "vilence tax" before the general elections in the coming May.
London's real estate maker Foxton warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, which presented stricter credit rules, would also lead to lower market growth in the second half of the year in both real estate sales and prices.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decline in the mortgage permit in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling down.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, adjusted its forecast for the increase of real estate prices in London for 2015 down to 3 percent, based on an already weakening domestic price consciousness.
The volume of transactions in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has decreased by one quarter a year, says the MAKLER WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital of Berkeley is a blessing, as the amounts due for future sales amount to more than £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and, as a result, the time sales remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost a third more than the highest level in 2007 before the crisis.
The annual ex-tax profit increased by 40 per cent annually to £ 280 million, the turnover by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
In a statement on Monday before the annual meeting of the company, Mr. Pidgley said that the revenues for Berkeley would likely correspond to the current market expectations in the current year.
The analysts estimate the annual preliminary tax profit at £450 million.
Berkeley shares were held in London at £23.96 in the afternoon.
Nod photos of Jennifer Lawrence posted by hacker on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appeared at the 85th Oscar Award.
Nock photos of Oscar Prize winner Jennifer Lawrence were posted online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images of another 100 Starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribes of Panama" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and complained to the hacker about "the eclectant violation of the privacy".
The authorities have been notified and will follow all those who continue to post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo sharing page 4chan were allegedly obtained by a hole in Apple's online storage system iCloud. The alleged "master list" of hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It is not certain how many of the images are real, although Winstead, a star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"Those of you who look at pictures that my husband and I took years ago in the private environment of our house - I hope you're so happy with you," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeonseries "iCarly" and "victorious" argues that in the photos about pictures of her acting and tweeted "These so-called naked images of me are GEFELSCHT, people.
Let's go back to the beginning.
Buzzfeed reported on a late Sunday that a speaker from Popstar Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive withdrawal from Howard Jacobson's highly promised new novel about love and the letter "J".
She collapsed, so you could best describe it, they slowly dissolved like a cardboard that was left in the rain.
Sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, strenuous, intense, distant and perhaps somewhat harsh.
And then shake his hand.
He knew a scratch.
He was squealing, like in Igel, yeah.
The last victim of this stiffness was a just beginning affair, which had been more promising for a relief of his lonely life than any other, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailins Solomons was a very delicate beauty with unsaturated hair and a smoothing heart from a village on the north island, which was even more distant and rough than the port of Reuben.
She had come with an older companion to the south, who kept the cavern for her aunts, and who had inherited a piece of land in a humid but paradise valley with the striking name Paradise Valley.
In several years no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were leaky, in which the bathrooms were still wired, the doorknobs had left their tracks on all the windows and believed that they belonged to all of them, and the garden was carefully guarded, which looked like huge coalheads.
It was like the house of a babysitter, both threatening and tempting, a garden of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the Longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The short list will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailin had sat hand in hand on the broken bed chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had gone mentally into the service console, which provided the country with soothing music and related news, when the sight of her cross-brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long forgotten black entertainer, whom his father had liked to listen to in closed rolls in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not prohibited - nothing was so forbidden - just not played.
It was successfully obsolete as the word obsolete.
The general taste created what adoptions and regulations had never created, and how people in books choose the from Tellerwasher to Millionaire Memories, cook books and love novels, they chose the ballads at the music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and to sit large feet in a grave-comb serenade of Ailin.
Ailinn didn't understand that.
"That was a famous song by a jazz pianist named Fat Waller," he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done this to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told me.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game at the time, and it wasn't very fun right now.
He knew that this was what he was expected of him, that's all.
It had to explain what Jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of any.
Jazz was not played, even though he was not directly prohibited.
The improvisation was no longer modern.
There was only room for a single "when" in life.
At the beginning of a melody, people wanted to be sure where they would end.
The same is true of the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And Jazz was a musically expressed mind.
Although he was 10 years old without being heard by Sammy Davis Junior, Kevin knew something about Jazz from the semi-secret collection of his father's old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain Ailin that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably could not remember a time when pop singers were not black.
Again, no laws or obligations.
A consistent society meant that every element of this society was grateful to the principle of group allocation - as was the case with those who gave up the fate.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports through temperament and bodybuilding, so they sang and ran.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were like nature blessed with electronic talent and cared for the task of ensuring that no family remained without a functioning service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewerage; what was left of the Greeks destroyed plater.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levante whose grandparents didn't leave the country quickly as if it were what history was, when history was out of fear of being accused of firefighting, even fear that the flames would consume them as the next - had opened labneh and shisha pipe restaurants, were concerned and were depressed with inactivity.
Every man according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, it was difficult to understand how the poignant words that Kevern had just spoken could be interpreted.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really policing," Kevin said.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never hurt anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave him the sad feeling of security.
Nothing could overcome the noise dampening of the huge carbon leaves.
Ailinn still doesn't understand.
Why would your father love something like that?
He wanted to say it was a jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers back on his lips in her presence.
She already thought he was something else.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief and blocked Kevin's view.
There was nothing else in the world but her ugly black-haired hair.
There was nothing else he would have wanted to see.
"If you say so," she means without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're stalking me.
She seemed really worried.
Are my feet too big?
He saw it again.
Your feet aren't so straight.
Maybe your bunny, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankle is too thick?
Do you hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your thick ankles are exactly why I like you," he tried instead.
I'm a bit of a pervert.
That doesn't sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often found himself in trouble because like his father, he did not have the calming charm that was needed to address the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevin.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailin Solomons became red and rose out of her bedside, threw the console around and poured out the wine they had drunk.
Holden flower wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excitement, they seemed to sit like palm wedel in the storm.
"And your dickhead is exactly why I feel perverse to you," she said.
Except I'm not.
She made him sad, both because of the unnecessary incompatibility of his words and because of the fear in her eyes when she leaned against him.
Did she think he'd beat her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like this.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke down here just like there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and worse than you, who, when their ancestors were smugglers and beach robbers, were ready to raise their hand against a woman who refused or insulted them.
Dickkopf?
They'd have shown her a thick forehead if she hadn't been watching!
She first knuts - Knuts was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, a antidote to the unsaid love ballads from the console - they first knuts and then beat.
In Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the knot itself was already an act of violence.
Ailin Solomons gave him a sign through her body.
He got out of the chair like an old man.
She also felt pale, but she was surprised by the weight of her grief.
That wasn't the end of the world.
You barely knew each other.
She looked at him as he went away - just as her companion at the top of the floor told him - a man, grieved by something he had vowed himself.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, turned his back, humiliated, defeated, without a spirit of struggle - why was this a view that she seemed to know well if she could not remember at one time when she had seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailin looked at Solomon’s feet.
Several years before the events just mentioned, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Onnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for the public mood, worked at a brief lecture on the continued low- and medium-level violence in precisely the parts of the country in which their reduction, if not abolished, was expected, in view of the money and energy invested in the eradication of this violence.
"It has already been done a lot, and a lot still needs to be done," she wrote, "to discourage the inborn aggression of a people, who waged thousands of wars and has won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, in which the sweet breath of human kindness was historically felt in spite of the high-profile church towers between the hedges.
But some properties appear to be inexhaustible.
The higher the church tower, the less the passion he continues to awaken.
The population weeps at the hearing of sentimental ballads, based on stories about overwhelming difficulties and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, yet still not only does the former prosperity hold the rural communities as well as our urban bodies in hand, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and sustained conflict at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to overstep," said her mentor when he read the whole report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask: are you Atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," Esme answered Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Again, Esme appealed to her right to privacy and to refuse the statement.
Feminist?
Shut up again.
"I don't ask that," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I would be against atheism, lesbentum or feminism.
This is an undisputed job.
We serve a community without prejudice.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are absolutely acceptable and commendable, may sometimes distort results as you have presented them.
They themselves obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things that you call "constant" and "raw" could be interpreted by others as well as an expression of natural strength and vitality.
If you continue to go around what history is, when history is, as if, if it had happened, it would have happened yesterday, that means taking the country's essential life force.
Esme Nussbaum looked after himself while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, a flashlight in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Onnow had given to the country in the last quarter century or longer.
Smile on her neighbor, value her partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use her phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speech is better than silence, the singing word is better than the written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand absolutely what you want out of it," Esme Nussbaum answered with a calm voice when she was sure that her supervisor had spoken to the end, "and I say nothing but that we are not as healthy as we are.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves again as we repeat the mistakes, which at all only happened to you when it happened.
This time, however, it is not the others to whom we give up our anger and suspicion.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To show an English patience.
"You go too far," he said, "if you call actions "errors" that our grandparents may or may not have done.
They also go too far when you say that they would have left their "anger" and their "disquieting" to "other".
It should not really be necessary to remind someone in your position that when we understand the past as in the protection of the present, we are not talking about "us" and "other".
There was no "we" and there was no "other".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From whom, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme ventured, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not complaining to anyone.
Whether it was bad or good done what happened has happened.
That was then.
There is no longer any need to say anything about this - that is where we agree.
And just as no blame has to be assigned, so no blame must be imposed if such a charge is appropriate and if there is a way to blame it.
But what will the past do if we do not learn from it?
The past serves to make us forget them.
If there's anything I can say -
Luther Rabinowitz dropped his pyramid.
"I will consider her report," he said and dismissed her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was overrun by a motorcyclist who, as passersby described, had been driven in a kind of "brutal anger" on the road.
There are accidents.
Lesotho Military Member says no state strike is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Officials of the military in Lesotho argued that they had planned a coup to overthrow the government and said they were going against policemen who were subjected to the arms of political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and reported that the country's army had surrounded its headquarters and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The prime minister brought his family to neighbouring South Africa after reporting on threats of assassination.
Military spokesperson Major Ntlele Ntoi said there is no de facto state strike, but the military is responding to the threat by "political fanatics", whose weapons are controlled by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of Lesotho's defence forces acted after receiving several intelligence reports that some elements were acting within the police who actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were just ahead of them to inflict devastating damage," he said against Voice of America.
South African government spokesperson Clayson Monyela said the military action had made the impression of a revolution.
"Even if no one has claimed to have abused the government by violence, all the reports agree that Lesotho's defence forces' activities have so far shown signs of a state strike," he said.
Speakers of Lesotho's military told on Sunday that the soldiers withdrew into their barracks and the situation in the capital was calm.
In the meantime, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over government leadership during the absence of Thaban.
Thabane told him that he believed that because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country, he had become the target disc.
Since June, there have been great tensions in Lesotho since the postponement of the Taliban parliamentary meetings due to the conflicts in its unity government.
He said that his actions would not have made the government unresolved, otherwise sounding accusations of spite.
Production in the euro area on a 13-month floor
The increase in production in the euro area slowed down in August to the lowest point of the last 13 months, with a carefully observed study.
The final market purchasing manager index of the manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a stand of 51.8 in July.
An indication of over 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went back and factories experienced upheavals in a time of increasing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures will take place before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
The markets expect from the Bank a clear plan for dealing with the slow recovery of the euro area and for the threatening deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information over the course of this week on whether to consider a quantitative relief for the euro area, according to those made by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth, the braking effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers have become more evident," said Rob Dobson, leading economic scientist at Markit.
The factory SME for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, in the second largest economic nation of the block, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a caring child, as well as Italy's decline from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Note that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism Germany, Spain and the Netherlands are no longer affected, are also not satisfactory," Mr Dobson said.
The decline in industry is likely to dampen the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the SME increased to 57.3 at the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economic expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say about the shopping manager index of the manufacturing industry in the eurozone since August is that the sector continues to grow."
He added: "Producers in the euro area are obviously finding life difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tensions - particularly in relation to Russia and Ukraine - increase uncertainty in the continuing difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and the confidence of consumers, and are likely to delay or even cancel some of the tasks, in particular major tasks.
He said that it would "always be more likely" that the ECB would finally have to introduce a type of QE, "though we suspect that this will be limited."
The Hellenistic Decade of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people from the Czech militia were taken hostages at a school in Beslan, South Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had died in the classroom at the Greueltat.
Just a decade after the mandatory siege of Beslan School, where 334 people died, including 186 children, the heroic survivors of last night warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
As fanatical Islamic terrorists, children and parents were captured and killed on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united West and East into Abscheu, and then suddenly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had died in the classroom at the Greuelat.
We found amazing young people who have overcome the resistance, although the memory of these terrorist hells will haunt them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that now visits Ukraine - and in the child as they die - will end.
The girl who was photographed when trying to climb back to the school hall
She was photographed and famous by Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov when she tried only in her underwear to climb back to the school hall that was broken after a mine exploded.
Aida was completely confused looking for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were kept dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me I was going to run for my life, but I couldn't," Aida said at the time.
My legs were blood streaming.
I stood up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier brought her to safety.
After a number of operations, she felt completely healed, but yesterday she said: "The pain returned three months ago.
I'm afraid I have to be operated again.
Some grenades are still in my knee.
Your goal now is to become a dentist to help people, as you have been helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says fighting.
"It's happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to the sports hall to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and we dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my study and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of her, although the memory of each year becomes somewhat weaker.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our fears and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I look online at the picture of me climbing back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our catastrophe and contribute that something like this does not happen again.
The boy who ran through the ballhole, in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school with 7 years) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old, he said, "Mama told me to lay down when there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she'd die.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearfully, she could be dead, he ran and saw on the road a crying little boy, grabbed it by the hand and ran through a bullet hole.
His father Vladimir, who locked his son out in his arms, said, "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said: I could not save them.
In fact, Tamara was stung outside and injured in the hospital, in her belief that her son had died.
She said after her reunion: "I cried out for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir later flew to London (from the now-resolved newspaper News of the World) to receive the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion from the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it'll blow in my memory.
I still know that I just threw away all my toy guns.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember these kids I played in the court with, and they didn't make it out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially the toy stores, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an open car.
But now he is afraid of a place like Ukraine where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffered.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer among the Greeks," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer last week in a monastery.
I'd like to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they'll take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were just no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London were crying when I told our story.
I understand how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how Damir and I have helped.
I still remember Damir wanting to eat Borsechtsch and call all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot her with his water pistol and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British so willingly shared our pain and supported us.
She said, "I always think this world has not improved in these 10 years.
In Ukraine the war continues now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still killed.
These are exactly the children like ours.
I think that for many of the wars there is a part of the news that they hear when they get tired or are busy with something else.
I just know how these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that is so sad.
Damir grew up and is a much gentler and quieter boy, he is not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he's not looking for Rachel, he's not overpowered by the past Greeks.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the sports hall and burn candles there.
When he was younger, he let himself down - I remember how he sometimes lay on the sofa, the face turned away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, bigger than me, looking good, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came to the legs, I looked around and looked at hell around me, with body parts everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy in this hell could have survived impossible.
"I remember saying to him, "Damir, run, run away," but I was also so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so life, unlike many others, goes on for us.
Georgia Ilyn, 17
The child whose terrible image has become the symbol of Beslan's cruelty
Comfort: Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, right a picture of Georgij today
His blood flowed face was filled with fear when he ran around his life while Czech terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of Beslan's barbaria.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had laid him off for his first day of school before she left to bring her older son Vladimir to university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she recalls.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer we get to this date, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is no single day on which we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's long ago, I mean, it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days always follow me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Introduced: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was preserved as a statue (right).
I remember Georgij wanted to go to school this day, and he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the weeping Georgia in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like to see the picture, and it's hidden at home in the bookstore.
I understand that, but I also mean that people in all over the world feel our pain thanks to this picture.
Georgij says today: "It is important that something like this can never happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever learn the truth.
People are always looking at such tragedies and never experience the truth.
And now they're investigating the collapse of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what caused him?
This world is going to be something terrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years are nothing like that.
We need dozens of years to forget a little bit.
It attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had some nightmares about the siege, but then it got better.
Later in 2004, I went back to school and was afraid every day.
I was thinking of my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I always go to the gym when September 1 comes closer.
I want to pay my old childhood friends Tribute.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget it, but I won't get hurt.
My life is going on.
This year I graduated from school and attended a medical college in Vladikavkaz.
I'm going to be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgia Fannyow, 20
The boy who survived, though caught at the feet of a murderer
A miracle: During the siege, Georgij Fanijev was caught at the feet of a murderer, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb, which was anchored at the foot of a murderer.
It's really a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We feel as if it had been yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer, but this could not be done because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind.
I am now older and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that's not true.
"2006 I worked with psychologists, and then I actually felt a little better, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time that I went back to the gym.
I've lost consciousness.
I'll never go back there and please don't ask me to show you where I was sitting in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the landing on the laptop
My pain is unbearable and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never asked me about school.
Physically, I'm fine.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can run well now.
But because of my health, I couldn't study at the FSB's Secret Service Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I've sent my documents, including the medical ones, and they've answered that it's not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He teaches the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should know nothing about it, and of course they should not suffer it.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse when the anniversary gets closer.
I'll go to the celebrations to remember.
I know Georgij won't leave.
It must be much harder for him because he was there and I didn't.
I waited for him at home and couldn't help him.
I am so grateful to God that he gave it back to me. Here in Beslan are all drawn of it.
It stays with us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept that if something like this hits someone.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He's been operated several times, he can run, but he can't run any sports.
I'd say he beat the horror to 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege and this only increases my pain.
I've lost a lot of people that I knew well and were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart weeps for the slain.
I know of families where new children were born, but also widows who have never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want it.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped into me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what's going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how could it be that we're fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many are still being killed.
If only we could take all these rebels and throw them out - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby so caught by a special deployment command
Saved: Aljona Tskajewa is secured by a Russian special application command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the cruelty at all
The world continued to breathe in 2004, when the baby Aljona was brought into the arms of a Russian police officer from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let them go, but in their cruelty they kept their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar back in the school gym.
Makhar, who was then three years old, survived, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous mammoth.
Her father Ruslan has been remarried since then and with his new wife Swetlana a little girl that he named after his missing daughter Kristina.
Aljona, today ten years old, does not remember the siege and is grown up to be an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors say.
"They are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You'll understand why.
Man accused of taking girls on a walk in Fife
A 78-year-old man is standing before a court for overcoming a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart is accused of assaulting a girl on the transition to Pittenween in East Neuk.
The accusation is that Mr. Steward controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and violated the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, disputes the charge before the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC set up the procedure for January.
4 Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you want to take photos or videos underwater, there is a selection of devices.
The most affordable option is a waterproof point and shot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both have for about $300.
I recorded these photos at a family party with several cameras that are all available at a price of less than $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery lid and other compartments are closed.
Also place your camera on the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorders have stage and recording modes that optimize the exposure time for the damp underwater conditions.
And before jumping in, check the depth to which your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.

Make multiple recordings - because many won't be hit.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that you can compose images with, usually not action cameras.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see it under water, and the right picture setting is a lucky thing.
So you're doing a lot of shots.
If your camera has a sequence mode with which to make a series of photos with slightly changed lighting settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light will dramatically worsen, the further you move away from the surface.
So if possible, stay close to the surface when you take photos in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This allows you to add more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important under water because of the bad light conditions.
It is especially important when you are working with an action camera: these devices often have a fixed angle lens, which means that you need to get closer to your objects if they are to fill in the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the kind whose character changed things, even in such a giant organization as the NHS.
As an adjudicator, he devoted his career to saving both the agony of the disease and the jaws of the treatment.
Among his patients, as his wife remembers, was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors had important diagnoses and diseases, while those treated mostly had something else to do with: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May this year.
I had trouble getting up.
While struggling with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he had made his wife Juliet impatient.
"I want everything as soon as possible," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusual and unconcerned.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to conduct an X-ray examination of his chest.
Only two weeks ago he was skiing in the French Alps.
The results of the X-ray were presented.
He gives to Mesotheliom, an incurable cancer that attacks the chest, that is, the lungs that cross the skin.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some lung cancer smokers have been sick, not all lung cancer patients have been previously smokers.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber building material, which was once considered "wonderful" but was now known as fatal.
For most of us, Mesotheliom is a disease that can easily be ignored.
Asbest is finally a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has been used in Britain since the 1960s when the industry voluntarily undertook not to use it.
Even where he was still employed, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - climber, construction workers, room workers and shopworkers, for example.
As an industrial hazard from another time, he seems hardly to be worrying today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Britain seems to be experiencing today the climax of a mesolthelium epidemic.
There are more deaths by Mesotheliom here than in any other country of the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease as in traffic accidents.
Annual figures of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the United Kingdom
The reason why we are experiencing the deadly effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (in 1999 all types of asbestos were banned), is that a mesothelioma develops only after decades.
And the Mesotheliom's nest is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still present in the houses where we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we buy.
And therefore Mesotheliom does not know class barriers, financial limits, occupations or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant shopping houses in London to private schools, are not a protection room.
Parliament's buildings are grounded in asbestos.
Even in the hospitals in which we are supposed to be healthy, this deadly carcinogen has already been exorcised as a starting point.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a climber, either.
It was actually hard for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found it out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at the Guy's Hospital, where I completed my education for six years," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and pfortners - use the tunnel.
You wonder how many of my peers will suffer in the same illness?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question in part.
"Of the four doctors who have been trained at Guy's Hospital and who have been sick at Mesotheliom in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010 "I am the last one who is still alive."
How many of us are still sick?
Mesotheliom was diagnosed with Andrew Lawson at the age of 48.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.
This was an unusually long time of survival.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends fatal.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question, "How many of us are still sick?"
The leading British expert on Mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, if the aseptic epidemic in Great Britain is likely to occur, a total of 90,000 of the disease will fall to the victim.
Most of them still have no idea that they will die like this.
An asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
A brief look at the facts of the courts, which are often referred to by the victims for damages claims, shows how far the mesotheliom's nest has already spread.
In June this year, for example, Marks & Spencer agreed to have Janice Allen exposed to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of the flagshipstores in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started her business at M&S.
Now she's got two kids in the gang.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of Mesotheliom, I didn't really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought that would happen to me once.
There are only a few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos refers, not to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name is derived from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the substance resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is the most frequently found asbestos in buildings today.
It was used for roof plates, floor plates, pipe insulations, boile insulations, even for brake linings in cars.
It is less lethal than other asbestos forms, yet the EU and the WHO consider it "a major health risk" with possible consequences of death.
However, the brown asbestos (Amozite) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "it is clear, however, indirect evidence that this was the main reason for the uniquely high mesotheliomas."
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed in the flagship store at Oxford Street, London, asbestos
Janice Allen may not have seen herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He has presented a study of the affected, which shows that "a substantial proportion of the mesothelioma without known suspension by work or in the house was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It looks like nobody can get away with being safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people could have been exposed to the substance in the heart of the government too.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind Parliament's Committee rooms were infected with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be irradiated by something as harmless as "strong air movements".
Members of Parliament are often accused of caring for their own interests, but here it seems as if the opposite is true.
While the management of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the West Minster Palace had received a "cleaner health certificate", it is now undisputed that £ 1 billion of work effort has to be put on over several years in order to renovate Parliament to modernise the electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that after the general elections in 2015 the MEPs will probably meet at the nearby QE2 conference centre rather than at the Green Banks in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the existence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the respective provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who could never precisely determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspected that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I've worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints have been decided positively," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember in all places where you have worked and the data.
What he still remembers is the day beginning December 2009, on which he received such a kind of fever.
He was 45, and he was just conducting an operation late at night.
Suddenly, I had gunfights.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I'd make the ride home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain of the chest, the skin around his lungs, was overwhelming.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors made X-rays of his chest and put on pleurakather to remove fluid from the lungs and test in the laboratory.
However, his complaints were not diagnosed.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his workplace.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after sports activity and strong breathing.
In 2011, a patient with similar symptoms came into practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now links don't do this with his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades old and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened and his house doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a probe equipped with a camera was introduced into the hole between the rib and the chest.
I'm an optimist.
I'm usually just going on," he says.
Honestly, I didn't even worry so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was between Christmas and New Year's: "I was told it was Mesotheliom."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesotheliom
Suddenly Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom recommended that he take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings, where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now sick.
And so Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were below the ground, so patients were not likely to be exposed to the substance.
But many employees who moved from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (such as Andrew Lawson) or in underground canteens (such as Graham Abbott often did) came in contact with the toxic substances with the highest probability.
It turns out that over several decades after the war, hospitals for the patients may have been life-saving but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
He's still getting away today.
Students put their bass burners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbeste was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls because of its fabulous insulating and flame-proofing properties.
Schools too.
In fact, many people have had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
All over the country, in thousands of chemical hours, students have placed their bass burners on asbestos mats.
On websites, the topic of asbestos in schools is now frequently addressed.
And that's why as innocent objects in our houses as floorboards or ceiling coverings have usually included asbestos.
"It's an industrial poison that is contained in many parts of our property," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that affected a woman was the embodiment of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful how you trim your garden sheds.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, are enormous.
"It takes a while to process it," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I noticed that I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not gonna have another Christmas party.
With the greatest difficulty, the change in perspective was from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to come with.
"It was very difficult to take it all," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How long have I got?"
And I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas party.
That's it."
Mesotheliom is particularly homey, because it is our survival mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes the deadly cancer.
Most Mesotheliom cases are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of the smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is vibrated and the fibers are inhaled, they can be fixed in the chest, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the chest and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart thorax doctor who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Exactly the hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected that it had exposed him to asbestos is now ironically, a leading center in the treatment of mesotheliom.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, says Treasure, "they are pressed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
From nature it is from the beginning invasive.
The usual options for other cancers do not work well with mesotheliom.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is highly controversial.
Some think she's worth a try.
Treasure doesn't do that.
"You can't cut out the chest," he says.
They don't come around with the knife.
Meanwhile, cancer "does not speak very well of chemotherapy," which "shows effect", but does not heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But in the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott still fights.
After contacting Mesotheliom, Abbott came in contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a single-man support and counselling office for his patients four years after his diagnosis.
"Hallo, cancer center," he gladly introduced himself to calls.
"He was very positive," said Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Initially, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that lasted four months and would probably prolong his life for only one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, managed to "make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, a heart thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage because I didn't have to be referred forward, I just called and got a date," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and wait for the treatment authorisation.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients to be able to experience the best available therapies.
But if these treatments fail inevitably, many are affected by another financial concern - about the future of the families that they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it was recognized that a very small burden was also a health risk.
And here the legacy of companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally added their case, but it wasn't what Morgan calls "full compensation" because Lawson couldn't prove with absolute certainty that his mesotheliom was to be brought back to an asbestos contact with Guy's.
However, after the investigation into his death, a spokesperson for the guy confirmed that "the asbestos fibers in the affected cellar area were removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, it is for mesothelioma patients who are trying to make compensation, a huge problem to assign the deadly asbestos contact to a company or workplace - usually decades after the events.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that it is time for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response to this, there was a clear new legislation in this year that makes it easier for mesotheliom subjects to claim compensation, even if their former employers were no longer to find it.
The law has set up a fund funded by the insurance industry of £350 million for all who have been diagnosed after July 2012 to prove a contact but cannot report to anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court could have promised them in a normal compensation process - about £120,000.
Some 300 successful applications for the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many mesothelioms that £350 million was a "very good job" of the insurance industry.
"It is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and indicates that this sum is a quarter of what insurers had to pay if the time had not passed and mesotheliom diseases found the companies and could normally report them.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pension, also admitted that the law was "not perfect".
However, both Penning and Morgan admitted that in the face of seven deaths, a rapid action is needed every day.
"People suffer so much and need help today," Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom Law in December last year.
At that time Graham Abbott was in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After her first consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation from which he expects a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy with the Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is of course with the most important," said Abbott.
You always see this in patients.
There's something that can keep you going.
If you give up, you'll get worse.
Graham Abbott underwent the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
After-care scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just got 50.
That's not life-threatening.
That's life-ending.
Again Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now there's no trace of the tumor visible.
But the process is very intense physically and mentally.
You have to think about practical things - about the money, if I am no longer, for example, or show my wife how the Boiling Line setting works.
If you get bad news, you'll be negative.
You need to look ahead.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"For parents it's hard," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I would have a disease that I wouldn't get old with.
They reacted quite differently.
Tamsin is very friendly and rude.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was a restraint.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesothelioma patients such conversations have not been conducted with hope, nor with a trace of hope for survival.
The disease (as well as finally for Stephen Jay Gould) brings great security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not life threatening.

China refuses the right to government election, demonstrators swear revenge
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided, despite the increasing calls for democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong Elections.
This process is likely to lead to long-announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists led the planning and mobilization to this within a few hours of the launch.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows communist leaders to reject all non-peking-trust candidates in principle.
"It's not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, president of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
The inhabitants of Hong Kong have been angels.
And it's clear that we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the approval of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government would be "chaotic".
Since 1997, when Britain returned control over Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let the inhabitants choose the government presidency from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented Sunday's decision as a democratic break, because there is a direct right of choice for Hong Kong's citizens, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership remains in the hands of a closely-controlled Beijing-controlled nomination committee.
After a new clause, only candidates "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the biggest and most effective protests have taken place in Hong Kong for several years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to kill the financial sector if Beijing does not allow a genuine general election.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy-Central supporters in the rain had gathered in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong within a few hours of their arrival.
In the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and they planned protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers said that the movement "regarded the occupation of the Central District only as the last means, an action to take place only when all the opportunities for dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We regret to have to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and there were increased security measures, including police forces and barricades, on Sunday before the government building.
Unrest is reinforced by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The attractiveness of people from the mainland strengthens competition for products and services.
The fear is also growing that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to break down under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticised the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central Movement as it threatened the business - the living seed of Hong Kong.
"The protests they are talking about could cause great economic damage depending on how many are involved and how long they will last," said legal expert Regina Ip, who has been criticizing the movement for a long time.
We do not want to hear any fears that Hong Kong is out of control.
This impression is bad for investments.
The state-controlled Chinese media also recently reported on the democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western authorities.
This summer, activists organised an informal referendum on the electoral rights in which 780,000 people participated - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July tens of thousands participated in one of the largest demonstrations of democracy in the history of the region.
The tradition of school graduations in the United States is now being transferred to universities where Frešchen shows are offered with the private aircraft.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and offer the first luxury travel service to UK students today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive performance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also stated that the service has a safety component.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to cut off their skills in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that this year students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
One company spokesperson said that there were no new bookings yet, since the service had just been introduced, however, he added that "Students would book the service in the coming weeks".
The company also announced that despite the study fees, it expected a market for this offer of £9,000 per year.
Today, students differ greatly in their expectations and demands from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do that.
However, the National Student Union criticised the service as having been abolished.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NUS for Higher Education said: "This offer seems completely separate from the life of most students.
Many students who start this month with the study are exposed to a cost of living crisis, as the available financial support in the form of loans and scholarships does not take a step with the rapidly increasing calculations for the simplest living bases before they can think of spending thousands of pounds for something as simple as arrival in the student home.
Feminists criticise race and police behavior in Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., early this month.
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while they were waiting for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators place the gender before the race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, while tensions in the Middle West increased and were observed throughout the country, Perez saw that the responses of white women turned around 100%.
Compared to the responses of black women shortly after the shootings of August 9th, the personal essays with titles such as "Thanks to Ferguson from a white woman" and "feminism is not only about the oppression of women" were relatively late.
But for Perez this meant an important change.
"I don't think there are many people in feminism who are about the white and speak privileges in such a high-class manner," she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the events.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnic that they must express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson highlighted problems that black Americans are exposed to every day, but are not regarded as "women's themes" in the cultural space.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere," Mitchell said.
If I post something about how colors are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them black women have not had the luxury of separating the topics clean; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now connect the themes of race and gender in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, Professor of Women and Gender Research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the Lynch murder.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came at the point where white fighters for women's election rights such as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the struggle for election rights could only be successful for one group: women or black.
"They made the decision to apply for women's election rights, and the right to black should come later," Hattery said.
When you remember such things, one with power is aware of why white women do not trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were granted the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade before white women were organized against Lynching in the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was born almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flow of white feminist reactions to the questions posed by Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "fishing" with the problems with which black women have been sitting apart for generations.
"Would it not be great if activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to receive control?" Mitchell asked.
Feminists of the second generation who are building their career in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now trying to understand what this means.
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown was shot and published a scored article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, in which she requested more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason for understanding a danger to the body - and opinions about the race that are clearly different in public surveys - will be introduced to the changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a more intersectoral feminism, in which race as well as gender issues are addressed, some of her comments on race theme in America are surprised.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" said against She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's comments on Ferguson are contrary to their previous criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently set up a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police's relationship with the black community is not the only problem that pushes itself into the background of mainstream feminism.
After almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors took part at the country's southwestern border this year, the issue of immigration reform is again on the surface - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, Co-Chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a review of the topic as an essential theme, they should only publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of the work visa goes to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a backyard in women's organizations," she said.
"Swine house" in Ipswich stands for sale
The picture of a house for sale was removed by real estate brokers, when it became clear that it showed a large pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for £120,000.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - including a pig who had prayed his head on a sofa.
Real estate maker Connells said the pig on the photo was the pet of the owner.
"But the photo was mispublished and was now removed," said a spokesperson for the company.
In the exhibition of the house, Connell described the earlier assembly house as a "one-family house with a bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The sale of the house in the social media was of interest, as some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW-City Harvey is home to a new millionaire after Lotto win
A Harvey lottery player is running this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth is ongoing, with a happy winner who receives almost $1.1 million from the lottery on Saturday.
For the second time in five years, a newspaper skiosk in Harvey pulled the jackpot in the draw of the first division, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the happy winner still has to report.
The store owner Steve Forward said that the win provides conversational material in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city speaks of nothing else, and everyone is quite excited.
We thought such a gain could happen.
Eight WA winners have celebrated last month's win in the first division, a paying conclusion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont had just won $7.5 million a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple had played for twenty years and said that the win would allow them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The Harvey millionaire is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas bat in the Gladiator arena
Not only did the gladiators stand in the match at the first Rheinbacher romertag in the leisure park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1,000 visitors yesterday, who beat the rainstorms and the autumn cold and left the historical spectacle unsatisfied.
There was a colourful range of presentations, performances, games, exhibitions and information about the time of the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial combat troops of the Gladiator School "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate their robust martial arts in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and skilled presenter and sent his men to the ring for a heroic twin struggle in various gladiatorial contests.
At first, the "provocators" were in the row with a right-angled and short sword as well as legs on the left leg and arm arm on the right arm.
It followed the "Esedarii" with chest shield, short sword and pumpkin as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Especially impressive was the appearance of the "Retianius", which came against the "Secutor" with thrownets, trizack and Dolch, and after a short fight stood the cages to the ground.
There, the heavy metallike force of each other, the shields created, and the worms flew through the arena alluringly, that fear and fear could be caused by the health of gladiators.
But the impressive Summa Rudis, the muscular judge, always had an attentive eye.
"We wanted to revive the Roman daily and make the culture of the Roman era exercisable," explained Lorenzo Euskirchen, president of the organizer "Friendeskreis Romankanal", the intention behind the show.
After two years of preparation, a "Oppidum Romanum" was found from the leisure park for one day, a Roman city, as Vice-Court Mayor Claus Wehage said in his greeting.
Finally, not only did the Romans bring war and conquest into our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous constructions that we admire today.
The rest of them were also to be admired during the Roman Day, such as "Aquéduct-Marmor" from the 11 meters high and 1400 meters long Roman Canal Bridge, which stood right next to Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society once faced water and energy supply, and CEO Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of that time".
This is also confirmed by diplomat Ralph Heiliger of the "IngenieurteamZwei" from Rheinbach, who presented measuring instruments of the Romans such as horobat, groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations in 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocaust, the heat wave heating that once warmed the Roman villa.
Impressive also are the footprints left by Wolf and Fuchs two thousand years ago in the footpaths of sound before they were burned.
In 2011, at the Rhineland Association, the Office for Groundenkmalflege had dug out the remains of a Roman villa in the North Business Park in Rheinbach.
A large wall of an economic building has been found with a durre for drying cereals and for milling.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural property, explained by archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A series of finds from these excavations presented them in a glass window, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a purple necklace.
The villa may have existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the fall of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, probably Morscheiser.
In addition, the children dealt with the Roman windmilling game, similar to today's milling game, or they wrote their names on wax boards like the Roman students once.
At the stand of the Roman thermals Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach glass mosaics, and at the stand of the natural center Eifel Nettersheim served a heavy wheat mill from stone to grind the flour for a flat bread or a mussel.
With the original post-constructed Roman passenger cars drawn by two cold flowers, the visitors traveled through the leisure park and also passed through the impressive state of the City Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Rome Project Weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the town of Wachtberg will also be introduced into the Rhôte d'état in 2014 that will commemorate the death of Emperor August 2000 years ago.
Together with the Home and History Associations as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the Partnership Association and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, a lecture, cooking and guidance for school classes will be offered and the Roman history of Wachtberg will be remembered.
For example, a Roman legionnaire from his work on the nearby Watchberg is told, plants are presented as living monuments from the Roman times and a funny lesson in matters of international understanding between a group of Watchbergers "Germans" and associated Romans.
The Adendorfer Primary School is dedicated to the theme of the Roma within a project week.
With the Roman week, the numerous, but often no longer visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be restored.
A small presentation will be given in the Wachtberger Rathaus at the founding of the Berkumer Matrone Shrine in 1879.
Ebola: The Epidemiology Charges the West African Economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are neglected - and international companies go away.
The devastating Ebola epidemic brings the West African economy to a severe blow.
The crop rots on the fields that the mines are left and the markets are abandoned - the virus has made the region difficult.
Some international companies are already distanced.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one," says African Development Bank chief Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is most affected
"It is a total disaster, we are losing a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothing on the second largest market in the capital of Liberia.
Only those who want to buy food or something to disinfect Ebola are on the market.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus, here alone the fever has fallen to more than 600 people.
Recently, health authorities explained that the disease was occurring at every corner of the country.
Also in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, the virus has spread.
A total of more than 1,500 people died, thousands more died.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
In the resource-rich countries, companies are putting their businesses out of business.
Foreign companies such as the Steel Group Arcelor Mittal withdraw their employees, several international airlines no longer fly to the affected regions.
The local traders and farmers also respond: only a few merchants leave their homeators to make sure they are resuscitation.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are quarantined, among other things, the cocoa and coffee beans that are important for export are rotted in the fields.
The farmers don't dare leave their home for the harvest.
Food will be scarce
"People will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Parisian expert on the West African economy.
The man who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables, for example, prefers to stay at home.
This is why the people get the consequences of the epidemic to feel directly and urgently: food becomes scarce.
On the markets, the stockpiles of basic foods disappear like rice.
At the same time, the region heavily dependent on international companies threatens image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The greatest danger is that international firms are basically avoiding the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugo from the French Think Tank Iris.
It is crucial how far and how long the virus will spread.
For investors, the impression may be that "it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus to invest", Hugo warned.
The disease also weighs on the state's stratified state budgets
The disease also weighs on the state budgets of the countries concerned.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be severely budgeted by the high expenditure on the health system and, in addition, by the worsening economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to assist the health systems of the countries concerned with $60 million (€45 million).
The effects are also noticeable in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far.
Although the entire region of southern Niger has not yet been affected.
However, there are already many people who are afraid of burning at home.
Bookings in hotels also go back very well.
Protecting her 50th anniversary
The club "Tannewald" Bergau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
At the Tannenwald Association of Protection, the preparations for the 50-year-old founding party from 12 to 14 September are on high tours.
It is planned on Friday, September 12th, a big entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker".
On Saturday, at 6:00 p.m., the big bullet shot.
Then he is in the big party of the moody evening with the "Stoapfälzer Spitzbuam".
Blasphemy ensures music
Highlights on Sunday are the Feast Service and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the big ceremony at 2 p.m.
The afternoon is also the price distribution of the federal and Gaussian shooting.
A particularly beautiful view will be the 25 fort ladies with their dirndln.
Hard chapel is the Blascapelle Berngau.
The patronage has taken over by Mayor Wolfgang Wild and Secretary of State Albert Füracker.
The original term "protection company Tannenwald Berngau" comes from 1907, when on 21 March the association was founded for "social entertainment through the exercise in the use of room-stewards and small-calibre shootings".
The NS regime had triggered the dissolution of the association in 1937.
It was only in 1964 that 19 young men were found again, who on April 30, in the guesthouse of Lukas the "new" association of protection "tannenwald" Berngau from the baptism.
Karl Marz and Adolf Ried led the club as a gunman through a difficult start time in which it was primarily about finding a club and installing the shooting.
Already in the fall of 1965, the club of protection in the guesthouse "Leininger" started with two teams in the round competition.
In the following years, the sports shields, which were now organized in seven teams, were established in all classes up to 1st Gauliga.
The association records were dirty every year and the magical limit of 380 rings was first reached by Rudi Meier in 1980.
As the performance of active protections has increased, so have the number of members.
After the "Leininger" association has ceased to meet the demands of a modern protection association, the then board, led by Johann Rinn, has decided to create a future home in the basements of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
On May 8, 1988, after 2700 hours of work, on May 8, 1988, Fatherer Strasser awarded the church blessing for the new protective rooms.
One of the major highlights in the history of the association was certainly the 44th Gaussian shooting, associated with the solemn celebration of the new shield in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Protection Association celebrated its 30th anniversary.
A Boller Group was established in 1995.
Josef Schmalzl became Böller's spokesman.
A major challenge for the "Ballerers" and for the Association as a whole was the orientation of the 2005 Bavarian Baller Meeting.
In many hours of honorary work, the members of the association in the past year have modernised the rooms and the shooting plant in Bergauer Hof and thus brought to the latest state of the art.
Eleven teams in the round match
The sports services of the Association can also be seen.
A total of eleven teams are currently participating in the round fights: six air defence teams, one air gun team, one KK1 sport gun, one youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann rose in the round 2013/14 from the Gauoberliga (the highest league in the ANB) to the district 1.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from Gauliga North to Gauoberliga.
In addition to the shooting sport, events such as bochstechen, Fassing and King's Ball, Association Tour and Christmas Tradition have been held.
This includes the protections at the parties in Pfarrei and the municipality.
Tony Stewart suffers an accident when he returns to the race track
Tony Stewart's return to the race track ended about half the way through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time after his right forelegs placed in round 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team leader Chad Johnston said his 14-head team was disappointed, but now focus on the race on the coming weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better use and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and we hope we can make it better there.
Stewart drove into a wall earlier in the race on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I came in today with pretty good hopes for a good result," said Johnston and added, "It just didn't fit."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the trailer and the team had packed and was ready to leave.
Stewart had three NASCAR Sprint Cup run off after his car hit and killed another driver at an ashtray race in the north of New York.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his workplace during a study of the tragic event that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr.. He was on the road during a race to confront Stewart.
On Friday, the authorities announced that investigations into the cause of the accident would continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made on whether Stewart should be charged.
The three-time champion was received with great applause when he was presented before the race.
After starting at 12th position, Stewart was in the first 10 steps and was temporarily in place four.
After a restart in round 122, Buschs runs
Car with No. 18 without control after exit from Curve 2 and collisioned with Stewart, both cars against the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell back to place 21.
Dancers Looking for Teenagers
Simply try out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and the leader Lisa Neitzel (from left) are looking forward to a match.
Like many other associations, jazz groups in TV Jan also create whole-day education at the next schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have decimated strongly.
Now, reinforced teenagers are looking for a kind of sport that is healthy and makes great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children.
"Three in the group of 18 to 12 years old, six in the group of 12 to 15 years old," says the 20-year-old.
With more assets, the whole would make much more fun, "you could dance quite different choreographies," she says.
Anyone who wants to dance can enter the dance room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, on Thursday between 17 and 18 a.m. or on Friday between 17 and 6.30 p.m. in the dance room.
"The training starts regularly with a heating program," says the coach.
After that, various choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no specified form and is therefore open for many styles.
Elements from folklore about classics to sports and acrobatics are processed in Jazz Dance.
Of course, the company is not too short.
"We also go to dinner, watch dance movies, and we've already stayed in the dance room," Lisa Neitzel reports.
In the group you can make friends, share a beautiful hobby and do a whole lot for your own motor development.
If Jazztanz is not so situated, it can also fit into one of the other offers of TV Jahn.
Children and young people can always enter school in the areas of children's/jazzanz, Bambini Ballet, video clip dancing and hip-hop.
The dancer is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples welcome to the dance evening on Monday and Wednesday.
Anyone who has a desire for Discofox, Slow Walzer, Wiener Walzer, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango can watch and participate.
Bulgarian prison guard protests across the country
Hundreds of prisoners from all over Bulgaria have organized a nationwide protest before the judiciary in Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration they repeated their demands after restoring their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Higher fees are also on a list of claims to be discussed with interim justice minister Hristo Ivanov.
Officials have been protesting symbolically for a month against the new working hours and calling for a return to the previous 24-hour layers.
Despite the meetings between the prison staff union and the representatives of the judiciary, the Bulgarian National Ratio (BNR) reported.
During the negotiations, the Director-General informed the BNR of the implementation of criminal measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the trade union Association of the Interior Ministry employees.
Ukrainian Army has given up Luhansk Airport
In Eastern Ukraine, the prorussian fighters are still on the front march.
After heavy battles, allegedly involving Russian tankers, the Ukrainian army has given up today, Monday, the airport of Rebellenhochburg Luhansk.
At the same time, the army reported that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroschenko had already drawn personal consequences from the heavy defeats of his army in the struggle against the separatists and announced changes in the top military leadership without mention of details.
Prorussian separatists fired aircraft
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, prorussian separatists once again launched a combat aircraft and two military helicopters.
About 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in battles in the Doneck region, according to Russian agencies on Monday.
Coast Guard Station ships are being lowered
The rebels also claimed to have lowered for the first time two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard in the Asian Sea.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of his ships were under investigation on Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards were injured, a speaker in Kiev told the transmitter 112.ua.
Two crew members were missing.
Local media made Russia responsible for the incident.
The separatists also reported that several villages in the area of Doneck were under their control.
Diplomatic offensives in Minsk
In the Belarusian capital of Minsk, the Ukrainian contact group meets today.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, a envoy of the separatists from Eastern Ukraine should participate.
In advance, all the actors used their performances to publicise their claim.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the Ukraine crisis due to the planned stations in Eastern Europe.
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday that NATO adhered to the 1997 NATO-Russia Council's founding agreement.
However, the NATO chief accused Russia of "a terrible breach" of the agreement.
"Today we need to see the reality that Russia does not consider NATO as a partner," Rasmussen said.
From documents and opinions from the Russian side, "they see us as opponents".
Strengthening NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced that NATO will increase its presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the east as long as this is necessary," Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree to new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have, according to official data, agreed on new discussions to settle their gas dispute.
The negotiations were scheduled for next Saturday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
A decision by the European Union to send a representative to the talks is still pending.
Due to the dispute over the gas price, Ukraine has not received any fuel from Russia for weeks.
Recently, EU energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had communicated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt the gas supply for Europe.
Europe accounts for about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Brand speaks power word: Soon will come "very clear"
Now the chancellor has made himself clear.
But it is not a free letter for all complicated details.
The CSU has been able to deal with severe concerns from the CDU against the car.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has, after persistent resistance from her CDU, spoken a powerful word for the introduction of a car.
"To say it clearly: it is in the coalition agreement, and it will come," the party chief said on Monday after meetings of the CDU summits in Berlin.
On a detailed model, however, Merkel did not determine first.
In the black and red government program, they are called "defined parameters".
Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made "a proposal and is now being further worked on".
The NRW-CDU, however, continues on its no to a moment on all the streets.
Merkel stressed that also Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) was constructive in the deliberations for a draft law.
In addition to the topic, he also talked to Dobrindt about other opportunities to activate more private capital for infrastructure investments, such as broadband expansion.
"There's nothing special about it." On Sunday, Schäuble had left a "reflection" report uncommented, his house examines its own concept to reward highway investors with mortgage revenues - after the 2017 election.
CSU Chief Horst Seehofer then warned to develop Maut concepts in the cabinet against the leading minister.
The CDU-Bundesvise Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
"The coalition agreement never went out of the way to bypass all the district and federal roads," said the North Rhine-Westphalia CDU president.
In this regard, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to speak again on the subject.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU associations Baden-Württemberg and the Rhineland-Pfalz.
There are concerns that a tide affects small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seahofer had asked for some of the CDU's coalition dream due to the critique.
The left sees the plans in view of the conflict in the Union as a failure.
"The Murks-Maut is dead," said partner Bernd Riexinger of the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
Dobrindt wants to introduce a Vignett obligation on all German roads, which will start in 2016.
However, domestic car owners may not be charged additionally according to a coalition agreement.
Therefore, they are to receive full compensation for the death through the Kfz tax.
However, the model must not harm foreign drivers according to EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
One British woman said she thought as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
It actually suffers from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and backbone.
Charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnoses are a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Some 23,000 people in Britain are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, insecure walking and bent toes.
Patients also suffer from feelings of numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she suffered from Friedrich-Ataxie (FA) - a disease with very bad chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she'd sit in the wheelchair before she was 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children who are 51 years old today said, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same as the others.
I fell down all the time and it took me a long time.
I could never ride with the other kids wheelchair or skateboard and was often at school because of my way of walking and running.
Rodgers said that when she was 13 years old, after several operations to unload her achills and stretch her legs, she had her patient file when her doctor had left the room and read that she was in FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA company," she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and ran into panic.
I thought I'd be in the wheelchair with 18 and die with 25 and in the meantime I'd lose all my skills slowly.
I did all this alone with myself and planted my own irrigation.
She said when she was 17, she realized that her abilities had not been taken off as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have that, otherwise you're already in the wheelchair."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, CMT was detected.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has started a CMT awareness month to pay attention to this disease.
Staff field web a. D. Berni Dieter has been working as a fireworker since the closure of the former army training site
For almost ten years, the former military training site in Munsingen has not been shot again.
Nevertheless, every month, the deadly ammunition appears in the heart of the biosphere area of Swabian Alb.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be pushed on site.
An eagle-like hook holds the blasts over the heart of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot was fired at the Münsingen Army Training Square, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operations.
Since then, the 6500 hectare large area has been the core of the biosphere area of Swübische Alb, which has been opened on 13 designated roads for hikers and bikers.
Tax tax on business people in the Washington area increases with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax notices for companies in the country increased slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, thus a newly published study last week, and companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid $27.6 billion to state and local authorities in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent compared with 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The state and local tax burden of companies increased by 4.3 per cent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 per cent a year earlier, and it was the third year of growth following the several years of declining notices 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes by 4.3 per cent, so the study carried out by the Service Agency Ernst & Young with the State Tax Centre was a tax policy group.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's income comes from companies.
Virginia achieves the lowest tax revenue from companies by 28 percent.
Most of the increase in tax revenue is based on a recovery of the company's real estate values, researchers say, which led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 per cent this year after the next three years with growth rates of less than 1 per cent.
While much of these gains came from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the process seems to be also to be available for the Washington area.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid over $10 billion to state and local real estate taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion 2012 - an increase over a year by 4.2 percent.
However, the apparent recovery of real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in increasing government and local tax revenues as the real estate taxes are almost five-fifths of corporate tax notices.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their government and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, a large part of the property, especially in the tax area around D.C., is owned either by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, managing director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced, for example, to rely much more on income taxes in order to provide the same services that other countries offer.
The recent recovery of tax revenue by companies cannot be attributed to the recovery of the real estate market alone
Business revenues also appear to be recovering, so the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes on government organizations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland entered $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is moving in the same direction, local tax for companies does not increase in all three places equally.
The rate of increase in the district was 4.3 per cent on the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 per cent.
Virginia alone reported an average tax rate of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has 6% in all three official areas the lowest corporate income tax (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 per cent and in the district at a relatively high rate of 9,975 per cent.
A comparable study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that lower government and local corporate taxes are required in Virginia and that overall a better tax climate prevails than in Maryland.
The district was not studied in the study.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbours.
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the State continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the State's income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017.
In the meantime, it seems better for small businesses in Washington, and therefore they pay more government and local taxes, so the latest study.
Business taxes, which are paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure whereby most small businesses are organised - in the district, Maryland and Virginia, increased by 20 per cent to $2.4 billion last year, a significantly faster rate of growth than total corporate taxes.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes throughout the country are likely to continue this year, with an increase in general VAT revenues for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the Washington space could be missed if the government's cut in expenditure affects the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hoppen and Malz - also in China a popular combination.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt Partner City in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight between the two cities.
German beer, married in Frankfurt's partner city Guangzhou - says the urgent wish of the officials in China.
"We would be very happy if a German brewery would settle in our city," said Deputy Secretary of the South Chinese Metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week when visiting a SPD delegation in his city.
Again and again, the official of the ruling Communist Party of China returned during the discussion on this issue of the twelve million metropolis.
Guangzhou, also called Canton in Germany, is one of China's richest cities, Warb Li.
Therefore, people also have the purchasing power to deliver German beer.
The Hessian SPD President Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would look into Germany for a possible partner for the project.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, grain and enjoyment of life," he added at lunch with the party cheerer in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already shines out to Mr Li, he flattered the host.
After that, the officer from Guangzhou stopped at Schäfer-Gümbel - however with red wine, which was served to the food.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German customs.
Tsingtao beer is used after the German offer of purity.
More business traffic
A second wish of the Chinese host would be a direct flight between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, Vice-Partieichef Li said.
Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but in 2012 it was for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again," the municipal politicians were convinced.
"Business between our two cities continues to grow".
Currently, travellers had to take the route over Changsha in Hunan province, Li complained.
The administration of Guangdong Province, whose capital is Guangzhou, also hopes for the airline.
The vice governor of Chen Yunxian, the province, put this wish first in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"It's a very good idea," replied Chefer-Gümbel - Chinese Deputy Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate German expert, agreed.
Maintenance of the partnership
Guangzhou's ambitious vice-president hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already at the top, but not yet in this function.
He was only in office this year after his predecessor was transferred from the office for corruption.
The local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to go.
The action against officials from Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in party and administration carried out by Chief of State Xi Jinping with rigour.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his career, which is most unusual in the Communist Party of China.
Prior to his entry to Guangzhou, he worked as a senior officer in Fujian, where the VW autobuilder built a large work.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to the 9000 km Guangzhou is one of those maintained on both sides, for example with a school exchange.
Last year the 25-year existence of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The South Chinese metropolis at the perflux is almost as strong with its economic strength as the whole Hessen.
Next year, they want to reach a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, Li reported.
Family of Joan Rivers "prints the Domes"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious three days ago since her delivery to a hospital in New York City; however, her daughter was now showing hope that the 81-year-old comedian would recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your enduring love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We all push the thumbs.
According to her mother, sources were delivered on Thursday after an emergency because of heart failure at a clinic at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, to Mount Sinai Hospital.
The doctors deliberately keep them sedated and carefully monitored until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as "serious".
The reactions came from many sides, including in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
For cars and vacuum cleaners that come into trade today, more stringent environmental standards will apply in the future.
Like refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners are given a label from September 1 on which the buyer can detect central data at a glance such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, "Euro 6" sharpened stick oxide values apply.
There is also more money for the farmers: they receive a uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros across the country.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information he had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (US$970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected to take over from Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would buy the company.
Three months ago, it looked like selling Twitch to Google's video service for a cool billionth thing, and the cooperation appeared also of course.
Twitch, founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravour pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games", so an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which better-known (mostly older) games give a touch of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It's just that YouTube is often called if you want to describe Twitch, so the message that you wanted to buy YouTube Twitch was taken up, somewhat slowly, a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It is a puzzle why the deal with YouTube failed, as the company reportedly was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know at the moment is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We have decided for Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who explain that they prefer to drive sports than to watch it, it is difficult to understand the attraction that comes from seeing others playing instead of taking the control console into hand.
It's a thing to look at a friend at 3:00 in the morning over the shoulder, while it's easy through Resident Evil, and something else to see a spinner shooting him in the head 20 times in Call of Duty.
All these games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are Ego games, so the addition without your own control over the perspective can be a good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the rapid transitions in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete all the games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there is no game or humor virtue, his Twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch is so elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could have just swallowed.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: thousands of young men who will be recruited as advertising customers.
As the president of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming," and the media does not show signs of shrinking, not even - swallow - as spectator sport.
At Hüpfburg at the Burggardenfest, a few things were going on on Sunday night.
The organizer's concept was correct.
Despite the heavy rain shower on Saturday night, 1200 music fans came to the open air festival in the castle garden.
In time, the entry had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Saltswedel l Light and fun.
From two Spanish words Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula.
Because the Open Air in Salzwedeler Burggarden is intended to radiate brightness in the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes from itself anyway.
This was already shown on the early Sunday night when the first visitors opened up to the Open Air.
A festival for all generations had been promised by the organizers.
And that's what they've got.
Around the supply facilities on the Burggartenwiese it had made Salzwedeler, but also guests from the nearest and further surroundings.
They followed the first live performances, wrapped up with the foot in the pace, enjoyed cool drinks - short: relaxation was pure and fun.
And that's through generations.
While one of the white sands hanging on the deck on the extra deck on the beach bar, others were working at a quarter of wine in the Vinothek, the growing up fell on the Hüpfburg, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But also in the fashion of children, the volunteers had to do all their hands in the true sense of the word to become the Andrang Lord and to enchant fantastic creations in the small faces.
The larger ones took advantage of the kicker table or participated in a skateboard workshop that the Goodfoot Crew set up from salt bead.
Until the great rain came.
Shortly before 5:30 p.m., he pushed the visitors down, especially families looking for the width and dryness.
But the attractiveness of the party did not stop.
"There came more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success on the whole line".
Therefore, there is nothing against a repetition of the great party in the coming year.
Although the content and size of the event still need to be worked on, Sem made clear in a first balance on Sunday against the people's vote.
As an outrage, he said that the admission had to be stopped in the meantime.
Apparently, the security company was booked with too little power.
The consequence: Some who had already paid for it did not come to the ground anymore.
The resonance was very good.
In a first careful estimate, the salt-swedeler co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who were drowning in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Hip-Hop-Band Blocks`n`Rox sold out its performance.
The technicians were unable to create a half-sounding sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to salt.
"In the coming year, however, they will be there," said the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula-Open Air was more than successful by the number of visitors.
And that's bad weather.
However, the organisers have made some mistakes that will be made for the first time, but need to be removed for the second time.
Also in the social network Facebook must be criticized by the organizers.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more," Melanie Meier said on the event page.
"Unfortunately, you took over a bit," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems so closely.
I think it's very good that some not only stupid chat, but also really try to put something on their legs.
Hut off!", writes Stephanie Jens to the Amula.
Now there is a year left for the organizers to put down these critical points.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's signs are shrinking
That is not the way it is expected.
Rather, the existing component is waiting to be used in the outstanding construction.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the creation of the TIRA Space Observation Radar, the so-called Radom is completely renewed.
The new radius will be slightly smaller with a diameter of 47.5 meters than the old one.
The size, however, remains world record.
The last step in the completion of the new envelope is the replacement of the cap
The upper quarter of the old cover is separated and removed with a crane.
Then the last quarter of the new envelope is set up.
If the weather goes along, the action should go over the stage at the beginning of this week.
participant in the ice bouquet challenger kiefer
Isabelle Roberts from Britain cried so much when her cold water was poured over her head that she violated the bone structure of her face.
This ice-bucket-challenge went down painfully.
A woman was delivered to the hospital after she had cried so much at the ice-bucket challenge that she cleaned up her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain went so far as her cold water was poured over her head that she damaged her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I cried, and while I was doing it, my jaws remained simple," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is protected over the age of 20.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but it didn't work out, the chef was locked up, and then I realized something was wrong.
My mother and my sister saw this too and were almost in the pants before laughing, but I had to get into the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from Great Britain was transferred to the hospital to reinstate the jaw after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the bourgeoisie soon pull back on a string?
Finally, there was always a gap between the two Wolfratshausen castles.
Now the Bureau is thinking about possible cooperation.
As an example of the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser castle, the deceased Richard Dimbath, former president of the Wolfratshauser castle friends, launched the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverine and the Burg friends Wolfratshausen.
So far, the views have appeared to differ as to how the history of the Wolfratshauser castle and possible reconstruction should be dealt with.
Now the two camps move together: Talking about a joint action is about to take place.
This is confirmed by the Association of Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfriends) at the request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we should get together once," Sjöberg reports.
In his view, all members of the two associations could go back to a string in the future.
Thus, it is faster to record visible successes.
While the castle friends were looking at Richard Dimbath's sudden death as a result of a reconstruction of the castle at the Bergwald, Sjöberg's "extreme and experience" of the site is at the forefront of the castle.
Herbert Piffl, the second president of the castle friends, was very pleased with the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he's been in front of the castle friends.
A new president is to be found at a meeting of Members in mid-September.
Currently, the association has around 40 members, according to 74 years of age.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we first let the association activities rest from respect."This "think phase" was necessary to "think about how it could go on".
According to Piffl, the new president will then go to the meeting with the bourgeoisie.
Until then, the bourgeois friends could also make an up-to-date mood picture within their grouping.
There is no candidate for the presidency yet, says Piffl.
"But I'm confident that someone will find himself." He doesn't want to run because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new president should be a wolf's-house.
The Tölzer wants to work on the project "but very much like to continue".
The different positions in matters of reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the near future.
He appreciates Dimbath as a "missionary", who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airport.
Through the high participation of the population and voluntary aid from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was skeptical at first too.
But in the course of time, I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to advance the project."A "all-setting feature" could be created for the city of Flößerstadt.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project could be financed by EU grants, visitors tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"The idea of reconstruction therefore I do not want to simply throw myself overboard." He hopes that the bourgeoisie may be moving at this point.
Their goal of documenting history first is "important and good".
Then you could go on.
Clear ways to save on Uni textbooks
Since the cost of Uni textbooks for many students amounts to more than $1,000 per year, the fast-second semester student Matt Schroeder considered a smarter sparidee.
He invented a rental system for books of higher semester students and offered a nominal compensation to delay the sale back.
"My math book normally costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-file-A-Kek," said Schroeder, 19, who visits the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The Board of Directors reported that on average, the students spend more than $1,200 a year for textbooks and study materials, but there are different cost mitigation options for the students.
Online stores and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of the choice for students.
Renting textbooks becomes more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a significantly cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, who operates more than 250 university bookstores, reported that the rental of text books has doubled since 2011.
Investigations in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in college bookstores were rented in the last spring semester, said Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased from the National Association of College Stores in campus bookstores.
Here's the only one for the best deals.
Buy Online
Some new books cost online only one third of the price they have in the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but the specialized bookstore Chegg.com can be referred to for $239.99.
Buy Used
If one does not make the notes of other or normal use traces, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is needed on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate at Brigham Young University, says that he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended students to ask their professors if previous publications are acceptable.
Sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older expenditure can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest expenditure.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, half.com by eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Rent
Renting textbooks is worth a consideration if you treat them a bit well, think about giving them back and do not want to keep the books after the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Find out about the rules of the business in which you are renting, including the penalties applicable to the writing of notes, underscores or traces of use.
Renter carefully: If you do not return the book, the penalty fees can even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg as well as Barnes & Noble Inc...
At Chegg, you can rent "calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, as many classics today can be downloaded for free, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Take a look at it anyway.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon visit the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the price determination for books as you can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before ordering online, you should check, so Gault, whether the book is actually pre-prepared.
This lesson he learned on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and finally paid the full price in the college bookstore.
Why don't Guardians of the Galaxy be a cashier?
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than 30 million dollars of his $90 million budget in the United States, while "Sin City: A Lady to Kill For" played only 12 million dollars of his $70 million budget.
The movie "Sex Tape" on Cameron Diaz only played $14.6 million at the opening weekend, while children's films such as "slightly made 2" also disappointed the revenue.
An article by telegraph critic Robbie Collin suggests that children's films of lack of quality could be the reason for the films themselves.
In 2014, Collin described as "the worst year" for children films and described "slightly made 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy continuation.
However, in films for a slightly older target group, it seems as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritical rating for each summer film start, which was shown between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and in the current year on at least 2000 canvas walls.
The results are based on the opinion of filmmakers and film critics, and indicate that this year’s film hits are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that development is due to changing habits and the growing popularity of web-streaming services such as netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's soon-to-be jungle-book film, said against the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think the times are changing."
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the current weak cash results of Hollywood production, net flix has recently achieved sales with current content of $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as in the previous year, in which sales amounted to $837 million.
In the last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticised the film studios for focusing too much on comic films and a "core melt" of Hollywoods.
In the light of the current demise, some commentators argue that his dark prophecy could contain a true core.
Due to the potential cash battlements expected in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, however, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, described the decrease in cash results recently as simply "cyclical" and said to Hollywood reporter: "The next summer will be the biggest summer on the cinematographic scene, and nobody will worry about the business anymore."
When the second table tennis district class was removed a few years ago for the purpose of punishing the league, this has been a step in the right direction.
Now the German table tennis band has added an additional 3. Federal League to the program.
The consequence: whoever has not risen has risen.
Thus Göttingen’s top-class team Torpedo in the Upperliga religion has avoided the decline, but only plays five-class in the next season.
Fourth class remains torpedo ladies, despite their great breakthrough into the regionalliga.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxonyliga, as well as the boys of the SC Weende.
The SG Langlern and the Torpedo Reserve join the new Association League, and the Göttinger Clubs are no longer represented in the Landesliga.
In the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the Associationsliga, the Torpedo 2nd in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better class of districts is now the new districtsoberliga Süd.
TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Upper SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and the TTC are taking place here.
In the district league, Dransfeld and the SC Weende are regional representatives, in the district class of TTC II, Red-White, the Upper SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III. The district summit of the ladies begins at least in a wave.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with the party.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarhausen will start running in the district.
With each of the nine teams
The SC Wende sends his girls to the small district league.
Also the district staff of the SCW boys - there still starts Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Upper SV go to the season.
In the first season of the newly established regional association, the two Göttinger circles start with each of the nine teams.
In the western shelf are the Red White II, Upper SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Milenhausen and SG Langlern II.
In the East Staff include Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen.
The Damen-Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarhausen II, Bilshausen, Heavenn, Seoulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the Osterode circle, where there are no women's teams at all.
Assuming that none of the six 2nd grade will reach peak strength, here the innovative and circular board will have to think once again.
Nato summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
At the end of the week there were protests of opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport to an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff in front of the city hall to hold a so-called countertop.
Stephen Fairclough has been tracking us on the weekend and talking to demonstrators who have traveled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenager flew out of the Blue Mountains
Two young bus hikers were secured with the sail wind after they were caught overnight in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
DAS 16-year-old girls and the 19-year-old man broke up on their tour shortly after Sunday afternoon in Govetts Leap in Blackheat.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 20 a.m. when the two were not returned home.
A search team from local police and rescue services broke up and the couple were found about 23 hours away from the Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had broken her knee and the man had collapsed and had hit his head.
Rescue forces stayed overnight with the couple, and they flew out on Monday morning.
They were delivered in stable condition with a ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Scale government-friendly protests in Pakistan
The approximately 1000 demonstrators were pushed out of the PTV building by soldiers, said Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid.
After a good half hour, the transmitter resumed the radiation.
PTV Director Athar Farooq said that the pieces-equipped demonstrators had damaged devices in the editor.
Dead or injured were not reported.
The demonstrators are demanding the resignation of the government chief to whom they have turned down the election fraud.
The police reported that around a kilometer away from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's residence it had come again on Monday to meet some 3,000 demonstrators with security forces.
According to hospital records, a policeman was injured.
At the end of the week, at least three people were killed and more than 500 were injured when demonstrators tried to advance Sharif's residence.
You are calling for the resignation of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday afternoon, after a meeting in the military headquarters, the powerful military called for a political solution to the conflict, "without time and without violence".
The Communication further stated: "The army remains committed to ensuring the security of the state".
The escalating violence has caused concern for an intervention by the military, which has been more frequent in the past.
The protests by opposition politicians Imran Khan and the preacher Tahirul Qadri have been taking place since the day of independence on 14 August.
Sharif refuses a retreat.
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers on Sunday to endure.
"We will not go back without forced Sharif to retreat," Khan said.
Qadri said something similar.
Khan proposes that Sharif have won the parliamentary elections last May by fraud.
Qadri demands the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government will reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are in use to protect the government district.
The demonstrators had first peacefully stood before Parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them at the weekend to move to Sharif's residence.
Hütteldorfer after the second season victory in place three of the table.
With the 2:0 over cropper for Rapid, a bitter week on Sunday ended a reconciliation.
"The victory is very free," said Coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached a middle class on Thursday in the Europe League.
"The success experience was incredibly important," confirmed Captain and Torschütze Steffen Hofmann, who had three seats with green white.
Scramble Dreamtor brings Rapid to the victory street Rapid has shown with the second season victory the right reaction to disappointment against Helsinki and goes with a successful experience into the country game break.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said Foreign Defender Thomas Schrammel, who with his wonderful leadership volleyball of the sixteenth generation in the 14th minute won the softs.
"I thought I'd put all the frost in from Thursday and rush it under the latte," said the 26-year-old smiling.
When Schrammel met in a federal league party for the last time on November 13, 2010, it was still for Ried.
The first championship meeting in the Rapid Dress will therefore remain in his special memory.
"To me this is something very special, I'm out of the Rapid Growth," Schrammel said.
Because of Mario Pavelic's short-term beckon, he turned his back from the left to the right defensive side and also made his thing very good there.
He has enough experience that he can also perform this position mirror traffic.
The door he earned, he's already made some assistants today," Barisic praised.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flange to 2:0 by Hofmann after a good hour, which finally made the decision.
Because the guests could have written about it.
"Thank God we have had some happiness today," noted Schrammel, who, in turn, pointed to the collapse of performance and result in the past few weeks: "The results have not voted, but the player was always good compared to last year."
Barisic even found that you had been "in many games before today" - against "the strongest team that has played this season in this stadium".
The first triangular points since July 26 have therefore proved that the team's addendum is intact in spite of this: "Today my team has shown that it has character".
No less happy for him: "That we have finally played zero again".
A lot of work during the country's break is also the case that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger have complained about several occasions, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger have given their debut debutes, making the victory even more valuable.
"You must not forget this," recalled Barisic, who in the past three days lost his friends and Pavelic players, "who have been very stable lately".
Therefore, the country's game break had to be used to "leap wounds and add a bit in the body," said Barisic, who has five U21 voters in his ranks.
One who is most likely to arrive at the break is Captain Hofmann.
He's tearing himself apart for the team. He's going through pain.
Just in this difficult phase he has shown that he is a very important player for us," Barisic noted.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his exchange in the 68 minutes not only the structure, but also reached the second gate.
For the 33-year-olds who completed his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first hit out of the game since 2 November 2013 (4:2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: "You mustn't think that everything is good now" "We've certainly had a bit of luck, but sometimes happiness has to come back to us too.
Now it was the highest time," Hofmann said.
He freely reminded of concentrated further work: "You must not always see it black and white.
We haven't played so bad in the last few weeks as this has been shown.
But we must also not believe that everything is fine now.
He couldn't resist the importance of his role for the team.
It is a very young team that I can help very much at the moment.
They still stick to me at certain stages," Hofmann said.
Grodig-Coach Michael Baur had little to do with his team.
He regretted the fast opponent "out of the category "Zaubertor", as well as the regular door of use in the 40th minute, which was recognized by judge colleagues to injustice.
The only proposition I can make to the team is that we were not exactly enough towards the gate in some phases.
There were too few conclusions.
Interior defender Maximilian Carner saw it similar: "It just started bad, but we found it clean and even made a door.
There would have been more in the whole of it.
Under this wreath, peace reigns
We showed a powerful tribe in our puzzlework of the summer series "My piece of Rhöner Hlück" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants still exist in the countryside, the illustrated copy is the "Geetzreiche" above the subwhite well.
An excellent footpath leads up to the approximately 600-year-old oak.
It passes to groups, basalt heaps and basalt lakes.
A piece below the stone break from Bauersberg, a kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it rumbles over the other trees of the surroundings and remembers with a range of more than eight meters to an American mammoth tree.
A small Buddha on a tree trunk indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive research, there were only indications of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has additionally consulted the Bishopsheim Archives and asked older people from under-white wells to find out what relationship it has with the Geißruheich.
The result of his research was the rather accurate explanation for the name.
Therefore, until about 80 years ago, the goats were to have driven their animals from underwhite well to the hard-dried and rock-free meadows.
At the foot of the tree are to rest the animals which are exhausted from the climb.
In the meantime, the area has regained its significance, because on the meadows they actually feed sheep again.
The area has also been declared the core area of the biospheric reserve, Schneider has further discovered.
However, when entering the stone collections, caution should be exercised, since the sun-heated basalt is also a popular place of stay for crusaders.
A hiking trail leads from subwhite well to the tree, but it is somewhat hidden.
Further paths are outlined, the direction of Hochrhön ascends and invites you to an extended walk.
Where's the water castle?
However, a water castle that is being searched for in our next task is rather rare in height.
The mirror in the tomb already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historic buildings in the countryside that the building counterfeit could fit.

After a long week's graduation, Italian Prime Minister and former EU President Matteo Renzi carried out the appointment of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as Head of EU Foreign Policy last week against strong conservative resistance at the EU Special Summit, becoming a successor to the British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi looks at how the government's newspaper La Repubblica reflects the appeal of Mogherini, also in the government's team as a favourite, to strengthen the position of the social democrats and its own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Not least, Renzi hopes that the left-wing party against him will be calmed again and again, because Mogherini will be assigned this - although rather moderately -.
Against the conservative representatives of the Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the Polish-designated President-in-Office Donald Tusk, the dominant opinion in Rome will be to create a political balance.
Because the EU's chief diplomat will also be the Vice-President of the Commission Juncker.
The European Parliament's still outstanding approval is considered safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the appointment of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) a "significant recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica is spreading optimism that, for almost two decades, Mogherini has proved to be successful in leading party offices and has been known for its ambitions to be the "great challenges".
The native Roman is married and has two daughters.
Her career began in 1996 in the youth organization of the then-democratics di Sinistra (Links Democrats), which joined the Margherita Catholic Central Party in 2008 with today's Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Youth Socialists) for three years.
With the 2001 election to the Left Democrat Party, she joined the high party policy, worked in the Foreign Policy Department, whose leader soon became her leader.
She took on the traditional focus of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, was known by studies on NATO deployment in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a troop quota, and maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, where she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became the prime minister in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini as his foreign minister.
If today the PD has a better relationship with the country's strong peace movement, which affected more than 40% of the party's votes in the May EU elections, then, as noted in the PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a share of it.
Therefore, there is a lack of diplomatic experience in Brussels, which the new EU external commissioners lack of substance, is opposed to in the PD.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltics, tragically realistic Mogherinis are being persecuted for the crisis in Ukraine and defamated as a "Russian-friendly course".
It supports the pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian company Gasprom, which is intended to be transported directly to southern Europe via Russian natural gas, which also serves Italy's energy security.
After Renzi had served as EU President in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow for her first visit to the state.
The photos they showed with Putin at the shake hands were taken in Brussels with excitement, as well as inviting the Kremlin Chief for October to a Milan Economic Summit.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an azubi which has already completed another training in the company.
In four training professions, the new staff will be active in the future: electronics (three trainers), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All azubis come from Schandorf County: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg form Forest, Felix Domaier from Oberweichtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Preimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainers visited primary and secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, trainees from all over the years as well as trainees go to a team training event in Oberamergau, where among other things a whole day of hiking and rafting on the Inn is on the program.
The company has 435 employees throughout Germany and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of trainees distributed over all years is 27.
The Socialists in France should "keep their mouth shut and put France in order," said Francois Hollande's most important ally.
Mr Valls called on the deeply fragmented link to show "your love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet conversion has failed in the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to remain on his side," he said with great applause.
As a depressing gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite strong demands for a lockdown of Emmanuel Macrons's new Minister of Economy.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande called on his fellow socialists to show themselves to the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the minister of justice, ran into riots in which she appeared at a meeting of a pitiful socialist MP and criticised the Socialist Party for taking the French "the faith in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, ridiculed the constant struggles of the Socialists and said that they could not imagine that the new Valls government would last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothing, but Prince Manuel Valls also has no, they are forced to form a new government if the old one has not even survived a summer.
"And the new will also not survive the fall or winter," said Mrs Le Pen against supporters.
She repeated her party's call after a resolution of Parliament and said that she was confident that in the elections she would stand out as a winner and be ready for the government.
The ruling party of France suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March and the right-wing National Front was at the front of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of the French think that the Socialist Party is at risk of falling into several rival groups before the end of the Dutch office in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a politician at the Science Po University, warned that the French would soon lose patience if the new socialist government did not achieve any improvement in the economy and the unemployment rate.
"There is a small window for possibilities, but the public opinion must quickly feel that things are changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could continue to deteriorate.
Norwegian Cruise just before a deal with prestigious cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise provider in the world, conducts advanced negotiations with industry experts to acquire the competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion.
A deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and its well-being, while it is in competition with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could already be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the talks could end in vain.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20% share of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous since the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a speaker for Apollo refused a comment.
The company based in Miami, Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenues were $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, acts under the brand name Oceania and Regent, who jointly operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenues for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry totals about $29 billion and is expected for it in the coming years due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging countries such as China and India.
The companies try to position themselves for these new customers as the best choice among the cruise providers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the US regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo is the majority shareholder of the company since a $ 850 million deal 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino group under the control of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thai.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock exchange in January 2013.
Genting held 28 percent of the shares at the end of June, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP held a share of 8 percent in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise jointly have 82% of passenger capacity in American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for the transfer of Prestige Cruises.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China on the day following the election decision.
The Chinese flag was swayed in the vicinity by a group of peking faithful.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress adopted a framework law allowing only two or three candidates for the selection of leaders in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is likely to have faithful members.
This decision will almost make it impossible for opposition democrats to be allowed to vote and motivated pro-democracy activists to face their threat and to lay the financial square of Hong Kong with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and China's leadership is afraid that calls for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper, in which China's leadership over Hong Kong was presented in June, democratic activists held an informal referendum on the electoral procedure in the special administrative region, where hundreds of thousands marched into the city's business area and organised a sit-in there.
Lis survey is organised by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-President of the Standing Committee Legal Commission, Zhang Rongshun and the Deputy Director of the Office for Hong Kong Affairs and Macus of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be questioned in the course of the day.
Student activists announced that they would meet in Hong Kong in the afternoon before the headmaster's office.
Until the end of the 150-year-old colonial government in Hong Kong, Britain had no democratic elements.
Putin demands from Kiev the admission of "State talks" with the Ostukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin requested Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting the separatists in the east of the country and immediately engage in negotiations on the "statehood" of the remote region.
His spokesperson Dimitri Peskow later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the area under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that his status vis-à-vis Ukraine had to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
However, Putin's call to the Kiev Government for negotiations on eye heights with the pro-Russian rebels is consistent with the strategy it has been pursuing since the outbreaks of five months ago: aid for separatists in the admission of territories and pressure to the Ukrainian government in order to enable the newly proclaimed Novorossia region to become truly independent for an alliance with Russia instead of with the West.
In an interview with the state television channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture the areas held by separatists in the eastern regions of Doneck and Luhansk, which were adopted in March and April after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula Crime on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the area taken as "Novorossia" or "Neurussland", a term that reminds of the pre-revolutionary shine time of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, during the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on October 26th and while government groups of civil communities in the areas held by separatists, are in the hope that they will "get caught in their illusions", itar-Tass reported.
"We need to enter immediately into detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of South-East Ukraine, in order to preserve the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskow said Putin's reference to the statehood in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed by the Kiev leadership for months to address concerns in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The explanation of the Kremlin speaker's correction of Putin's comments underlined Russia's leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, in contrast to the direct annexation of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have had far greater difficulties attaching the regions of Doneck and Luhansk to the East Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls from the time before the conflict provided a large majority for the settlement in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums would empower regional governments in Ukraine to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, thus de facto giving the Kremlin control over an area that connects the Russian state to Crimea.
The peninsula annexed to the Black Sea five months ago is the home port for most of the Russian Navy as well as an important commercial port and historical coastal region.
The regions between Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and firefighting plants, which make important components for the Russian military.
In his speech on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that the Ukrainian legislation - after the elections - should consider constitutional supplements, which would allow for greater control of their finances and the status of languages in the respective areas.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels whose weapons and uprisings are being put forward in Moscow.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with separatists leaders at eye heights followed a further advance of the rebels last week, after Russian troops and panzers penetrated the former peaceful region along the Asian Sea into eastern Ukraine.
The separatists supported by Russia took over in the handcuff, which, according to the fears of Ukrainian security officials, is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, the control of Novoasovsk.
This is why massive civilian and military preparations are under way to secure a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants between Novoasovsk and the narrow access to the peninsula of Crimea.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels on Saturday and urged action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are just ahead of a point where there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide on concrete actions, which called for the draft further sanctions against Russia to enter into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tankers and 1,000 soldiers entered the Danube region last week to support the separatists, Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesman of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, said reports in Kiev on Saturday.
On Sunday, Lysenko was informed that the first 63 Ukrainian soldiers involved in the Russian invasion in Ilawojsk were replaced on Sunday by 10 Russian paratroopers who were captured in the Ukrainian territory a week ago.
Nuke photoscandal for Australian promises and Gabi Greece
Geoffrey Edelste did not make a cure for his troubles about hackers who probably stole naked images of his engaged Gabi Grecko and a who is Who the A-Promise from Hollywood.
The film city is excited after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence in a hacking canal around Promis on the Internet.
The hacker responsible for this is probably 60 naked photos of Lawrence, star from "the Tribes of Panama" and Superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lee Michelle and the actress Kirsten Dunst.
The Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahowski, and Grecco from Melbourne reportedly also made private photos because of an iCloud hole.
The list contains 101 promises.
The noblest who had engaged Greece last month said to the confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Greece, currently in New York, reported on a news page that the hack was "disgusting" and that the victims felt "injured".
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-friend Scott Speedman, including two recordings in which she is upstairs without a pool.
Among the films of Palmer are "Love Is Unbeatable" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actor Browning from Sugar Punch were not available for comments on the hacked images yesterday.
A representative of Lawrence' said to TMZ, "It's a terrible violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked images from a cell phone is nothing but the sale of hehlerware."
As a matter of law, the distribution of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radlers, joggers and hikers were at the 8th Radel on the Great Feldberg yesterday and thus supported the Association "Help for Cancer Children".
The tour for which one was a torture was an easy training for the others.
But in one they all agreed: It was fun.
Thomas Studanski must have slept well last night.
Because for the first time in his life, the chief of the Colonel's brewery drove his bike to the Feldberg yesterday.
For the sake of the good.
The small muscle catheter can be easily hidden there, especially the participation on the 8th Radeln on the Great Feldberg for the benefit of the Association "Help for Cancer Children" (France) has also brought him a valuable knowledge.
That's a great thing.
"I know now that I can do this - fine!"
Little paddles on their way to the Applauscurve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been...
Like Thomas Studanski, who is sitting for the CDU in the Upper Town Parliament, many of the 718 participants in the early morning flocked to the mountains and came to the conclusion, but fortunately on the platform.
On the other hand, it was easier to overcome the good 11 kilometers long route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dietner, for example.
The whole green politician from the Kreistag - red dress, red bike - made something more on understatement at the beginning ("Every amount of profession, there is the goal!"), but then turned out to be half a professional and went through the goal after 45 minutes without breath.
He also crossed the route in a rutch, as did Nina Kuhn, the press spokesman for the city of Oberursel, who had been on his way together with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathlets, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "Here's Charity, here's where we're happy - we would have made an exit today," Kuhn said.
On the way, they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) went down to Oberursel in the morning to climb back to the height.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swung home at 9 a.m. to "make" the Feldberg twice to roll home with fun.
He also had fun "Fritten-Toni".
For the chief of the upper cult kiosk, cycling tours across the Feldberg are easy to do.
He had played with his 6.5-kilo race bike for 40 minutes.
It's a crazy event.
For this purpose - I am happy to be there," Andreas Balzke said.
The coached mainzer says he's an "absorbed racer."
That's what he has to be, because he was on his way with the "Fixie-Rad", which is also racing wheels, but without switching...
Not only did the 20 hikers climb up the white wall and the fuchtstand to the summit, but also a jogger who carried a tire with weights behind him on a cable.
Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with Allrad-Bully and Quad, said: "I know the one from Frankfurt who trains for a special ski trailer, only that he pulls the skis himself." So the man is certainly his own skis dog.
The 718 participants - and so many as never - were sent to groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 a.m.
The first riders and runners followed it at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain biker was released.
Bent Hansen, president of the Association "Radeln på den Großen Feldberg", gave the start commandos and wished the participants a nice trip.
For the next year, he hopes that it will be possible to block the route up to the Feldberg to the safety of the participants.
