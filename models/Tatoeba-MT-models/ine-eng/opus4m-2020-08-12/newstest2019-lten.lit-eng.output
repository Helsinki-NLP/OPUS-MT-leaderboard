Ethical Guards: Liberal Alliance Board on the Law of the Vilnius Department
"The decisions taken by the Government are in accordance with the statutes", - after the commission meeting, the BNS reported to its leader Vytautas Tamoshiūnas.
"Our decision was not something new.
An explanation as a commission has already been made in July, when the question of Apégia and Utenna was raised.
Then we said that under the statutes this is a matter of the competence of the board.
And if the board decides that a section can act as it wishes - to go with the committee and the board agrees, then the board can go, but if the board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, what the board has adopted, then it is the decision that all sections should form party lists.
And if you do not agree with the board, then there is an opportunity to stop membership and to go with the committee," he added.
According to Mr Tamoshiūno, the party board will now decide on further action.
On 17 October, the Liberal Alliance Board of the Party annulled the decision of Vilnius City Division to participate in the municipal elections, not with the party, but with the newly elected electoral committee.
In the opinion of the party board, the decision of the capital Liberals to participate in the elections in the form of a public election committee violated the party's statutes, the decision of the board.
By October 31, Vilnius had to withdraw its efforts to participate in the municipal elections with the Committee's list.
But the department didn't.
The former Head of the Chamber, the member of parliament, the Eastern Armonaitė, has already withdrawn from the Liberal Alliance.
Vilnius Mayor, former President of the Liberal Alliance Remigius Shimashius, who promises to pursue another term of office as the capital leader, has already presented the team and ideas of the public election committee "For Vilnius, where we are proud".
He also left the party.
The elections of municipal councils and mayors will take place in March next year.
On Monday, officials reported a check by the villagers in northern India on the tractor that had previously broken up a man.
The forest surveillance officer Mahaviras Kaujlagi (Maaviras Kaujlagis) said that soon after a man who worked in the fields on a busy Sunday, the villagers surrounded the animal and, while trying to escape, caught it by a tractor.
Residents say that the tiger also attacked a young man about 10 days ago.
The village is located in the district of Lakhympur, about 250 km south-east of Utar Pradesh state capital of Laknau.
It shall be prohibited to take over the control of tigers in protected areas.
Dr. Ramesh Pandey (Rameshas Pandey) said that the case would be reported to the police under the Rural Nature Protection Act.
In April, the village of Utar, in the Nighasan region of the state of Startesh, destroyed another tiger, and suffered serious injuries.
The tiger is an Indian national animal; under the Wild Nature Protection Act, tigers are considered to be extinct species.
Last year’s government reported that in the previous three years, at least one person was killed every day during the encounters with wild tigers or drums.
People’s conflicts with tigers have gradually increased since the 8th decade, when India started a tiger protection programme, which established trains in national parks, and the slaughter of large cats has begun to be a crime.
Although tiger calculation methods have changed, the census shows that the population of around 1,800 tigers increased to 2,226 in 2014.
Proposed cats and dogs with mandatory micro-schemes
The Chairman of the Seimas Committee on the Environment, Kęstutis Mažeika, together with other Seimas members, has registered amendments to the Animal Welfare and Protection Law proposing that cats and dogs should be labelled with sub-schemes.
"We propose that cats and dogs should be labelled with subcutaneous micro-schemes and that they be registered and labelled by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, all dogs will be marked free of charge and in 2020, even cats, so that the population will have no worries and the costs will be covered by specific government funding," said Seimas Environment Committee Chairman Kęstīs Mažeika.
Amendments to the Law aim to address the systemic need for pet labelling.
This is expected to help avoid problems caused by irresponsible animal breeders, illegal breeders or sellers.
It is provisionally estimated that, according to the expected average price of the micro-scheme and service delivery of around EUR 5 for the transitional period, compensation will be granted to all owners of animals.
The total price of all animal breeders can reach up to EUR 6 million.
It is planned that the need for these funds will be distributed within three years and will reach EUR 2 million annually.
It is expected that funding for labelling programmes will be made available through the Municipal Environmental Protection Special Programme, which will significantly increase revenue this year due to increased redistribution of natural resources taxes and funds.
These funds will be available not only for the marking of cats and dogs but also for castrations and other programmes.
According to K. Mažeikos, mandatory labelling practices in almost all countries of the European Union allow for the protection of the animals themselves (which cannot be easily returned to owners), and saves the time of the pet growers themselves when they have to spend a lot of time and money on the search for the refugees and the displaced.
In addition, EU legislation provides that only marked farmers can travel.
At the same time, labelling requires responsible care for the animal’s entire life.
The previous proposals for compulsory labelling were subject to opposition, as the programmes in question were proposed to finance the population.
"The current model of this criticism should be avoided, as animal protection is proposed to finance increased income in the environmental support programme and the right to label not only veterinary doctors, but also publicists, i.e. those who have heard special courses at the Veterinary Academy," says the authors of the project.
The draft law was registered by a group of Seimas members representing the different Seimas factions - Kęstutis Majeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenius Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.
13 government forces killed during the Taliban attack in East Afghanistan
Arif Noori, a representative of the governor of the province, reported that seven soldiers and six police officers were killed.
He added that four more soldiers were injured during the attack at the joint military and police control post in the Chojani region.
According to A. Noori, six fighters were killed in a three-hour battle with the Afghan forces and ten more Taliban were injured.
The Taliban representative for the press, Zabihullah Mujaid, circulated a statement on the media in which the movement assumed responsibility for the Monday attack in the province of Gazni.
A. Noori said that this post was installed in a strategically important area two days ago in order to reverse the Taliban supply route.
The post was completely destroyed during the attack.
"Murt" sent a hand to help Ukraine's club
On Wednesday, the Vilnius Eastern arena will host FIBA's fourth round of events, which will be held by the Kosovo and Ukraine clubs.
The Dvikova will be prepared in the capital for political reasons.
Heat relations with Ukraine's basketball team will be joining the Cherkasski Mavpy and the Prishtina KB Prishtina on 7 November after their roof in the Eastern arena.
"For political reasons between Kosovo and Ukraine, we were unable to build this match at home, so we are very happy that our friends from Vilnius agreed to accept us, - Coach Max Michelson of the Ukrainian team thanked the East.
- We have a lot of friends in Vilnius, and our countries always agree.
Lithuania is one of the best basketball traditions in the world, so we will be truly honored to play here.
Let's hope we get some backup from the whales.
The Kosovo team could not come to Ukraine because these countries had no diplomatic relations.
The Ukrainian team is currently taking the third place after the first round with one win over three meetings, and the Kosovo team is in the second position and has more.
This will be particularly important for Group E Acosta, as only two teams will reach the next stage.
In the past in Vilnius, Ukraine and Kosovo took part in the 2017 European basketball competition.
At that time, the Ukraine team won 100:61.
On Wednesday, the basketball fans will be able to access the matches free of charge, and the start of the two - hour period will be 19 hours.
"Women lie better" star actor B. Arsobait is persecuted by lies
It's probably just a coincidence, but the amazing autumn actor Brigita Arsobaitė has already played a role in lies.
At first the series "Women Lie Better", then the show "Melagės" and finally the comedy "Melagais".
In this film Brigita plays a prominent wife of Dainius Kazlaus' hero.
"I enjoyed filming in the Melagia," because I'm more of a theatre actor and I appear in movies rarely.
A wonderful team of colleagues has been gathered from the very beginning with the excellent result of the promise.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened on the ground was the dog Sunny!
All my life, I thought if I had a dog, it would be really big and serious.
I've never played those little, decorative "fifties" four times.
However, during the filming Sunny so stuck to me that the sympathy became mutual and I finally got it to buy it from the landlord, but it didn't work," the actor laughed.
For the first few minutes, a new Lithuanian comedy "Melagais", which was produced by Lithuanian film hits "Unexperienced" and "Among us, boys..." was produced by Paul Virbick and by Stasis Baltakis and Vladimir Razarionovas.
Your lover just reported, she's waiting.
It would be great to know, but... your beloved is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
If you can't publish all the "good news", your parents say it's unexpected - they're different!
After 50 years together...
And all this is happening just before the most beautiful Christmas of the year - Christmas!
But the end will be even more surprising, for no one expected such atoms.
All the heroes are not what they seemed to be from the first look...
In addition to B. Arsobaite comedy "Melagai" a good deal for spectators four times a movie star: Giedrus Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita Užaitė, Giedrė Giedrītytė, Liubomiras Laucevičius, Larisa Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Heardvainis.
Comedy "Melagai" - in China since 9 November.
Whether to write off the unpaid taxes of EUR 100 million for migrants
On Tuesday, Seimas adopted an amendment to the Law on the Declaration of Living Place drawn up by the leader of the "States" Ramun Karbausski.
The 56 members of the Seimas voted against -9 and abstained 25.
Next, the Seimas will take corrective action on or after 6 December following the conclusion of the Government.
According to R. Karbauski, these contributions are calculated for persons who have not declared departure from Lithuania.
According to the parliamentary, within three years one person will not pay about EUR 1 000, and now there are about 100 000 such persons.
Social Democrat Algird Sys regretted that Seimas would thus "invite people to refrain from obligations" - declare departure and then no fees would be charged.
A member of the Health Committee conservative Antanas Matulas noted that Lithuanians living abroad use the fact that when paying a small health insurance fee, they come to Lithuania for treatment - they receive the same services as those who pay this tax to residents.
The amendments provide for those persons who have left Lithuania to pay social security contributions in the European Union, the European Economic Area States or the Swiss Confederation, and "Sodra" will exempt them from payment of health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
Mindaugas Sinkevičius has previously said that this step will facilitate both the life of the immigrant people and the activities of Sodro.
An Internet-based video about a falling forest reveals a serious problem
It is threaded as a mother’s lap slips into a straight snowy layer, and the child is still sticky, folded down, and back again a hard copy.
The video was watched by many reviews and comments.
The people were staring at the little fox's resistance - not once they walked down, he was bathing with his mother again.
He does not succeed for the first time, but he does not try to give up and finally reach his goal.
The video is really focused, but it also reveals the threat to animals.
Scientists argue that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people’s desire to know the wild nature can sometimes be harmful.
"I can see that the bow of the drone was very enticing.
Their movements show they're panicking.
If the drones hadn't flown around, they'd probably have chosen a safer path or had it overcome more slowly or more cautiously.
This is a great example of how drones should not be used," said Ecologist Mark Ditmer to The Verge.
Some time ago, Mr. Ditmer, along with his colleagues, researched how the drones operate.
In animals, heart rate meters were adjusted.
When the drone came, one winged let go of it, the other left nowhere, but all their hearts began to faint more and more.
Scientists recommend that drone animals be filmed in a responsible manner, not to fall too close, not to raise noise, and not to fly where it is forbidden.
He applied for the last president in the newspaper
On Tuesday, the Kiev Court invited former President Viktor Janukowyti, who had retired to Russia, to come to the proceedings for his alleged state extradition meeting in an unusual manner - the summons was published in the State's official publication.
At a call from the court, published in the Government's Newspaper "Uriad Kurjer", the former leader is invited to attend a trial session on 19 November, during which his final arguments could be heard.
The document states that Mr Janukowyčius has the right to participate in the video link.
On 30 October, the Kiev Court published a final debate in the Janukowytus case.
A lawyer working in Russia, Mr Janukovyki, was given the opportunity to register before 19 November in the register of foreign lawyers so that he could attend a meeting where Mr Janukovykis is expected to have his last word in the video.
The Kremlia-based Mr Janukowyčius was transferred and fled to Russia during the uprising in February 2014, provoked by the President's refusal to sign an association agreement with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former Ukrainian leader had been transferred to Russia through a special operation organised by Moscow.
In March of that year, Russia annexed the Crimea Peninsula to Ukraine, and the country's eastern side later experienced a war between the separatists supported by Kiev and Russia.
Since then, some 10,000 lives have been spared, despite many attempts by the international community to secure long-term benefits.
List of conservators to Vilnius City Council in Valdas Benkunskas
As a Conservative candidate, a former Minister of Economy, MP Dainius Kreivys, had already been approved a year earlier.
During the first weeks of the conservative elections, the party members rated the list of candidates for the Vilnius City Council.
As the party reports, the chairman of the meeting of the Vilnius Chambers of the TS-LKD became the leader of the conservative list.
In the first ten candidates were members of the Vilnius City Council Paulė Kuzmickienė, Adams Bužinskas, Gediminas Švilpa, Audrius Skistys, Rasa Baskienė, former member of the Seimas Liutauras Kazlavickas, President of the Young Conservative League Mantas Benkunskas, Arūnas Valinskas and Goda Karaziaitė.
Direct elections of mayors and municipal councils in Lithuania will take place on 3 March next year.
Restrictions on cogeneration plants against the Constitutional Court
The opposition of the Seimas, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (KT) against the ruling of the rulers to adopt a law on the possibility of suspending the construction of waste incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the opposition group of the Seimas Father Union-Lithuania Christian Democrats (TS-LCD) reported that the group of Seimas members had applied to the KT, requesting that the amendments to the Constitution of the approved Waste Management Law be examined.
"Parliaments stress that the provisions of the law aim to call into question the projects of waste incineration plants already under way, instructing the Government to establish new restrictions (20 km from the residential area) until the law enters into force in Vilnius and Kaunas for the construction of waste incineration plants", - the report states.
"Parliaments note that in view of the fact that the prohibition in the law on the construction of waste management objects (i.e. the definition of distance and the definition of the concept of "resident territory"), it is concluded that this prohibition is disproportionately restricted or even denied the right to carry out the business of the production of waste incineration-related energy-related activities, since the established criteria are to be formulated in such a way that, after assessing the density and distribution of the Lithuanian population in the country, it would be practically impossible to construct such objects throughout the country," it adds.
We would argue that the law adopted is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
"KT has repeatedly pointed out that the legislation does not apply to the legal facts and consequences that occurred prior to the entry into force of the new legislation.
In this case, the Government is given the power to apply the law back in accordance with an indefinite criterion.
The constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal security and the protection of legitimate expectations are violated by the establishment of such a legal regulation, and hence the constitutional principle of the rule of law."
It also notes that large financial investments have already been made in the projects of the cogeneration plants of Vilnius and Kaunas.
After the projects currently under way, the state would not only experience a hundred million financial losses, large losses, and the people of Lithuania would increase the heating prices, resulting in increased pollution of the environment in waste disposal.
Members of the Seimas TS-LKD, Liberal Alliance, Socialist Group and the senior member of the ruling Socialist Working Group, Algirdas Butkevičius, signed an application to the KT.
A few weeks ago, Seimas managed to raise 71 votes with the rulings to reject the amendments to the Waste Management Law adopted by President Dalia Grybauskaitė veto, which provide for the Government's right to suspend the construction of cogeneration plants already started, and also set a 20 km distance from the residential area of quarantine for the construction of such plants.
The amendments to the law adopted by the Seimas will enter into force as of 1 January 2019. It is true that the rulers already propose to withdraw the 20 km limit.
This proposal is scheduled to be discussed at the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, the Government's right to suspend projects already under way is not planned.
KT will examine the order of the case - not earlier than a year later.
Posted by LeBron James statistics at Lakers Club
The beginning of LeBron James' career in Los Angeles Lakers Club is not the same as he expected, organization and basketball fans.
The Lakers season started with four victories and six losses, and such a weak start helped to bring about the release of coach Luke Walton.
However, such languages calmed the President of basketball operations, Magic Johnson, who said he would not forgive the coach, but it was necessary to play better.
The largest star of the team, L. James, should return to himself.
Although the attacker's statistics are usually impressive - 26.8 points, 7.6 recovered balls and 7.7 results.
But she's not telling the whole truth.
During the first ten season competitions, other numbers also showed that Lakers is playing better when there is no L. James in the field.
The attacker has no +/- statistics showing how many points more bet or misses the team when there are certain players in the field.
That's when L. James is on the field, Lakers spent 30 points this season than competitors.
He won 19 points more than the competitors when he sat on the ground.
The Lakers Conference is currently taking place in just 13th place, but several victories can turn everything upside down.
Spain will continue to contribute to the protection of Lithuanian airspace
The meeting noted that Spain will contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
"Lithuania highly appreciates Spain's cooperation with NATO and its significant contribution to ensuring the security of our country and region," said Minister L. Linkevičius.
Spanish Air Force has already conducted NATO Air Police and Air Police Strengthening missions in the Baltic States five times, of which three times in Lithuania.
For the last time, the destroyers of the Spanish Euroofighter were deployed in Šiaulia this year in May-August.
In addition, Spain will contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
The Minister also noted that regular consultations on security, political, economic and strategic communications are taking place between Lithuania and Spain in the fight against propaganda.
L. Linkevicius expressed hope that Lithuania and Spain will continue to cooperate closely on European, transatlantic and other multilateral issues.
Since 2004, when Spain opened its embassy in Vilnius, Ambassador Jose Maria Robles Fraga is the fifth Spanish representative in Lithuania.
On 29 October, Jose Maria Robles Fraga presented his letters to President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
V. Achienė on the detention of R. Acho: I believe in man's insecurity and the rule of law
"It was the most incredible thing I could never think of.
On the other hand, the services are likely to carry out the work they have to do.
Each one of us works his own work.
I believe in the rule of law, I believe in my husband that everything is right and fair, that no dishonest action should be taken against him," said Mr Acienė.
R. Ača Special Investigation Service (STT) held Monday - the law enforcement suspect that he, as still the director of the administration of the municipality of Razeni, took a high amount of money and could create exceptional conditions for a private company that signed a contract with the municipality-run Razeni Bus Park.
Private company representatives shall be directly suspected of paper by R. Ača or a participant in masking mixed financial transactions.
On 3 April this year, the council of the municipal council of the district of Raseini, R. Ača, resigned from the post of Head of Administration following the expressed mistrust.
As a former member of the working party of the Socialist Party of Lithuania, Gedimina Kirkil was newly established this year, and he suspended his membership in this party on Monday.
Some years ago, he failed in the mayor's elections as a representative of your election committee, "Your Raseiniai".
V. Achinė says that the man did not intend to hold his candidacy in the Rasei Mere elections the following year, but had not yet decided whether or not he would participate in the municipal council elections.
V. Achienė is a member of the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission.
The policy says that there is a waiting period for further legal action - it will depend on whether it will be removed from the work commission.
"I really don't make the family decisions today, this week, I think, I'll decide.
I see, if there is a need to make the accusations made, I will, of course, make one or another decision.
It may be necessary for me to stay away from all the things that are being examined by the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again - everything will be set aside in its place," she said.
The representative of the opposition Conservatives of Seimas Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulenienė invited Seimas President Viktor Pruckietis and the leader of the "states" Ramūna Karbauskis to withdraw from the statements of the Group of the Environment Achilles and withdraw her from the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission by moving her to another Seimas committee or commission.
It states that further work on the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission "would lead to a society-based mistrust and discredit the work of an important parliamentary supervisory commission".
Sensitive Coldplay music interested and famous Lithuanian couple

On the west coast, the Israelis attacked the Palestinians with their mouse
The war "contradicted this attack because it identified a terrorist who tried to beat civilians with a bat and an IDF (Israeli Defence Forces) soldier", says an Israeli army report on the incident at the Kiryat Orb's siege near Hebron.
"The military set fire to a terrorist and neutralized it.
He was taken to the hospital.
The Israeli civilian and IDF soldiers have not been harmed", - the report adds.
The military representative for the press told the news agency AFP that the attack was attempted by the Palestinians.
After the incident, the filmed material shows that it is not seriously damaged.
The wave of similar Palestinian attacks began in 2015.
Such attacks have decreased in recent years, but it is estimated that their wave may be new.
On October 22, a group of Jewish soldiers near Hebron were shot at by the Palestinians.
Grybauskaitte calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU business
President Dalia Grybauskaitė invites China to create a more favourable investment environment for the investments of European Union (EU) countries, to facilitate foreign import conditions.
Grybauskaitė stressed that, in view of the signs of economic slowdown in Shanghai, the common goal of Europe and China should be to "unite efforts to stop the spread of protectionism in the world", applying to the root causes of the tensions caused by trade wars, "overproduction and unfair competition".
"The European Union is very important to China's commitment to create a more attractive, open environment for investment - it is important to negotiate a trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade agreement as soon as possible by ensuring that foreign business is expected and secure here, as well as by strengthening the protection of intellectual property," said Grybauskaitė.
It considers that China's opening up is important not only for Europe, but also for this country, as well as for global economic growth.
The head of Lithuania stressed that the transparency of investments must be "more than any business group's interests".
"Transparency, rule of law, strict compliance with international treaties - this must be an essential issue for the environment of new investment relations," said Grybauskaitė.
"Corrupt capital flows should not be expected in any state of the world - not just here or in our countries," she added.
China is attempting to mitigate the criticism that it is avoiding opening its market and protecting only its companies.
The exhibition is attended by several heads of state, more than 2,800 companies from 130 countries and regions around the world, including Lithuania.
According to the Lithuanian Statistics Department, China is currently taking the 25th place among the export partners.
Last year Lithuania's exports to China grew by 50%, reaching 180 million euros.
At the same time, imports from China amounted to more than EUR 820 million.
Some officials are concerned that China's investments in Lithuania may have an adverse political impact, and Beijing's exclusive attention to Eastern Europe undermines the EU's unity.
Inconvenient solution: mobile signature service is already in operation

The reason for the crash of the Lion Air aircraft: the anger of the dead
The data from the Lion Air Launderer of a married Indonesian airline indicate that over at least four of its last flights there has been a disturbance in the speed meter’s work, the researchers reported on Monday.
The Chairman of the National Transport Safety Committee (NTSK) told Soerjan Tajjon that the same direction occurred during the last four flights of the aircraft, including the fateful one, when the other day on October 29 fell into the Sea of Java immediately after the flight from Jakarta.
During this disaster, all 189 people died on the plane.
Many media measures reported irregularities during a previous flight of Boeing 737 MAX 8 from Denpasar to the capital of Indonesia.
"When we opened the black box - yes, the technical problem was actually the speed of the air, in other words, the speed of the plane," said S. Tjajono during the press conference.
"The black box data showed that during two flights before the journey Denpasar-Jakarta was also the same problem," he added.
"Societal networks have a lot of fun.
Now we want to explain that in the black box (referred data) there were four flights where there were problems with the speed meter," said the NTSC head.
At the meeting with the family members of the deceased, Mr Tjajon said that the information of the aircraft recording the flight data was consistent with the reports that the aircraft had changed its speed and altitude in an irregular manner after the last flight.
Search teams have not yet found the second black box recording conversations in the pilot cabin.
Lion Air indicated that, following the establishment of a technical failure from Bali to Jakarta, it was corrected in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
One of the founders of the company, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to speak to contact Minister Budi Karyas Sumadi, a meeting of moderated family members with officers overseeing the search for aircraft and victims and a disaster investigation.
However, he stood up and bowed his head when angry and distraught family members demanded that R. Kirana, together with his brother Kusnan, present the Lion Air in 1999.
"Lion Air was acting improperly," said one man, who was introduced as a passenger to Shandy Johann Ramadan, working as a prosecutor on the island where the plane was flying.
"I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to draw attention," he stressed.
- Lion Air has never been in contact with me since the beginning of the crisis.
We lost our baby, but Lion Air didn't show us any feelings.
After this meeting, R. Kirana quickly left, avoiding the issues of journalists.
Many families are waiting for the long-term results of the recognition process.
Police medical experts have been transferred to nearly 140 parts of the support of people loaded with lavender.
So far, only 14 victims have been identified.
The parents raised the question why the helicopter was allowed to fly during a two-month period, although failure occurred during a flight from Bali to Jakarta on 28 October, among other things, after the passengers were shocked by the sudden crash of the plane down immediately after the take-off.
Lion Air said this failure was removed.
Is it true that the problem has been solved? - He asked one of the sons of the dead.
- If not, the relevant techniques must be taken into account.
The Law was very clear, but they did not claim that the plane was allowed to rise again.
These bad techniques must be answered in accordance with the law so that aircraft disasters in Indonesia do not happen again.
Mr. Tjajono said that a large amount of small fractions and the fact that the fractures had spread in quite a small area indicates that the other was likely to have been in the water at a very high speed.
"The plane was unique when it fell into the sea.
He didn't blow up the air, and the aircraft's engines, when he slammed the water, acted in large turns - this shows all the broken turbine minds," explained the officer.
The Lion Air Laundering has been the biggest aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997 when 234 people were killed by Garuda on the plane near Medano.
After the crash, rescuers were directed: injured and underage
On Monday evening on the road to Vēžai - Plungė, Tilviki met with cars "BMW" and "Mercedes-Benz".
The cars have been hit by a car crash, reported by three people who have been injured.
It is reported that the BMW driver, born in 1999, went to the opposite side of the road and the cactus raced to the Mercedes-Benz car, which was carried out by his father, born in 1967, and his daughter, born in 2005.
The BMW driver was rescued by firemen - rescuers.
For a girl from Mercedes-Benz in an accident to get her teeth kicked.
All the victims were taken to the hospital.
Presidency: there is no need for artificial concessions on the referendum
After the Seimas approved the proposal of the rulers to reduce the referendum card to the first section of the Constitution which currently has greater protection, the President amended the veto, her adviser Mindaugas Lingė said.
"More than half of the population voted for the Constitution - that is the requirement.
This is its change, especially in its first section, should certainly be no less than a majority.
It is not hard to warn that the President would really vote," the Dalia Grybauskaitė's adviser to the internal policy said to the Knowledge Radio on Tuesday.
He stressed that the first section of the Constitution defines the basic matters of the state - language, flag, territory, capital, sovereignty of the state, so that, by reducing the number of votes required to change these articles, according to Mr. Linge, there would be a 'negative precedent' and a 'open risk'.
"In the President's view, there is no need for any artificial relief, the need for a referendum itself, the need for more dialogue with people," he believed.
The Seimas plans to vote on Tuesday on the adoption of an amendment to the Referendum Law.
It provides for the adoption of amendments to the first and fourteenth sections of the Constitution which have a higher level of protection, provided that at least two fifths of the citizens who have the right to vote are approved during the referendum.
Currently, more than half of all citizens entitled to vote may be replaced by a referendum in the first and fourteenth sections of the Constitution.
The right to vote in Lithuania has about 2.5 million citizens: half would be 1.25 million voters, two fifths would be millions of voters.
This proposal was born after Seimas approved in September of the President's veto on the amendments previously adopted in Parliament, which mitigated the requirements for the number of votes in order to change Article 12 of the first section of the Constitution defining citizenship.
The card for the referendum is proposed to be reduced by preparing a referendum on dual citizenship, which should take place on 12 May and 26 May next year when the first and second round of the presidential elections are planned.
Emigrants cannot have dual citizenship at present, except for some exceptions, on 11 March 1990 following the restoration of their independence.
Double citizenship is sought by the Lithuanian community in the world, but fears that the current referendum will not take place - that there will not be a sufficient number of people to vote.
R. Masuulis: Lithuanian airports "spaška", therefore they need to be updated
Lithuanian airports and road infrastructure are beginning to fail, so it needs to be updated, says Minister of Communications Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, updating Vilnius airport is a minimum task that the State must perform.
"The air transport infrastructure is already failing because it was planned for lower passenger flows.
We must renew Vilnius Airport - this is not even part of the remote planning, this is the minimum we must do", - Mr Masuil said on Tuesday at the communication conference organised by the Development Fund and the State Journal.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be extremely important, as important projects will have to be implemented - the completion of the Via Baltica, Rail Baltica, the external airport of Klaipėda, the renewal of Vilnius and Kaunas airports, and perhaps the construction of a new airport.
"The next decade will be very important - we need to complete road integration, railway integration, construction of an external airport in Klaipėda, airport management, perhaps deciding on the construction of a new airport.
We must not sleep, we must now start projects that will take advantage of our potential after 10, 20 or 30 years," said the Minister of Communications.
Mr Masiulis has said that too little money has been spent on car road maintenance in recent years.
"The state of the streets is still not improving because the funds are not being allocated enough.
We are able to build new roads, but even the most necessary supervision, for example on highways, is lacking.
We must set the amount that should be allocated to road maintenance if we want their situation to improve," said Mr Masoulis.
He stressed that exports of Lithuanian transport services increased 18.6% this year, and the largest export market became Germany after Russia.
Mr Masoulis once again criticised the European Commission's proposal that EU carriers should return to the country of registration on a regular basis.
"We must strive to make our exporters in Western Europe feel at home.
In my opinion, the proposal to keep the tractors back home is absurd, as empty trucks, fuel-burning, and emissions increase in Europe.
Most of this is done by railways, as costs will rise so much that part of the transport will go to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our position," said Mr Masoulis.
According to the Ministry of Communications, 12.2% of the transport sector is created.
Lithuanian Common Domestic Product (GDP).
It employs more than 118,000 workers and operates more than 7,500 companies.
Ginger with heiress
Last week, Mr Masuilis, in the Seimas Economic Committee, announced the beginning of negotiations on the amendment of the cultural purpose of the Vilnius airport building, which would allow the old terminal to be destroyed and a new one to be built.
However, the interim leader of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD) Algimantas Degutis p. Masiulio called the discussions a political pressure.
According to him, the building built in the sixth century is a value, registered in 1993, not for politics, but for experts to decide on its removal.
Mr Masiulis then commented that the modern arrival terminal would contribute to improving the image of Lithuania.
"To withdraw that old terminal from the legacy would be a politically important step to break it down and build a new modern arrival terminal so that you can feel back to Vilnius in a modern country, rather than that interesting, truly unrepresentative of our country as innovative," - last week Seim said Mr. Masiulis.
Mr. Masiulis also reported that Kaunas is planning to build a completely new passenger terminal and to connect the airport to Rail Baltica by building a underground station.
This transport unit should operate in 2026 after the end of the "Rail Baltica".
Last year Vilnius Airport served about 3.7 million people, this year it is expected that 4.8 million passengers and 5 million next year.
Last year, Kaunas Airport served a total of 1.2 million passengers.

Next year, Vilnius will start direct flights to Madagascar
In the spring of next year, the largest scheduled flight will take off at Vilnius airport, Boeing 767, which will fly directly from Lithuania to the Be island of Madagascar on the basis of information from the travel organizer Itaka Lithuania, writes the portal "madeinvilnius.lt".
It is announced that Blue Panorama airlines will be able to choose from 259 business and 8 business places.
The new holiday course will be reached directly from Lithuania as of April 2019.
Dominikas Milowskis, Director General of Itaka Lithuania, says that tourists from Lithuania are trying to offer all new holiday directions.

Minister of Finance on the potential crisis: it is important not to talk about diseases
"We always have preparations for the most difficult times.
What I want to enjoy is that in the third consecutive year, for the first time in Lithuanian history, we are stockpiling reserves.
But it is also very important not to talk about diseases," said Mr Šapoka on Monday when he was in Brussels.
ELTA recalls that on Monday and Tuesday, the Finance Minister and Deputy Minister Miguel Tuskienė attend meetings of the Euro Group and the EU Economic and Financial Council (ECOFIN) in Brussels.
The ECOFIN meeting discusses issues relating to the taxation of digital services.
This new tax aims to avoid fragmentation of the EU single market, as some Member States have already introduced or intend to introduce a certain tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed to agree on how revenue from certain digital services in the EU Member States should be taxed until agreement is reached at global level.
The Euro Group will review the draft budgets of the euro area countries submitted to the European Commission (EC).
On 23 October, the EC rejected the Italian draft budget as non-compliant with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time that the EC makes use of this option.
For more information, please contact Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain.
The Euro Group will also discuss the strengthening of economic and monetary union: the possibility of implementing the European Deposit Insurance System and the reform of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports the stronger role of ESM in financial support programmes, but it is believed that ESM functions must be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication between ESM and other EU institutions.
Balys Burachach.
Lithuanian labour traditions and customs
Recently he was born 120 years after the birth of a prominent Lithuanian photographer and cultural metrologist, ethnographer and co-director Bali Burač (1897-1972) in Sidari, Šiauliņų state, then in Šiaulių government.
With regard to the 100th anniversary of the Lithuanian state, we have a great opportunity to remember how life-encompassing national rebirth has called for many of the Lithuanian people, including the brothers Burachus - Balus, John, Bronius - from the very depths of the village, we are able to engage all the creative ones in the decorating, equipping and preservation of our cultural traditions.
Balys Buračas, who traveled for more than 50 years after his home country with a camera in his hands, presented a broad and real picture of our country’s customs, traditions, folk art and material culture.
He sought to preserve the rapidly disappearing national cultures and had a rare ability to understand the continuing value of his work.
In the pictures of Bali Burač, Lithuania's landscape, pilgrims, everyday and festive environments have adorned Lithuanian newspapers and magazines with national costumes.
This publication contains a large part of the Bali Burach legacy for the description of national work habits and related traditions and, most importantly, their attractive iconography.
The published material shows not only the nature and beauty of these traditions, but also the progress of our civilization over the past century, despite the two world wars and heavy occupations.
In the book's handwriting, there is a great deal of intermediation of the Zemaiti, particularly of the works of the Pilgrims, the Sikhs, the Talmuds, as well as the works of the inhabitants of the Upper and the Dzukia people, their festivals and other traditions and the usual descriptions of the Bali Burač.
Some 10000 negatives from museums and archives have been selected for this publication over 400 rare, mostly unpublished, photos that have been grouped by selected texts.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture that are characteristic of cupcakes, dunes, other regions of the Highlands and of the Netherlands.

A Tragic Marriage — Dead Within a Few Hours of Marriage
In the southwestern United States of America, a couple of young people who had been married just hours earlier died during a helicopter crash.
Twenty-four years old William Troy's Byler and his wife, Bailey Raye Ackerman Byler, died on Sunday shortly after midnight, after a helicopter entered the mountain 16 km to the north west from Juvaldi and 129 km to the west from San Antonio, said local peace judge Steven Kennedy.
It is surprising that the disaster occurred about 20 miles [24 km] away, just as young people had been.
A 76-year-old helicopter pilot, Gerald Douglas Lawrence, also died.
Young people studied at Sam Houston State University, located in the city of Huntsville, Texas.
They were married on Saturday evening in the hands of the Byleri family near Juvaldi, and after the wedding ceremony, they took out a helicopter belonging to the family.
The accident took place about 20 miles [24 km] after the helicopter crashed.
Young people flew to St. Anthony’s International Airport, where they intended to fly to the plane and fly the honeymoon, said S. Kennedy, not stating the ultimate goal of the couple’s trip.
"This is a very rocky, uneven relief area, and that mountain is about 120-150 meters high," said S. Kennedy.
Mr. Lawrence has been piloting that family aircraft for many years.
According to Mr. Kennedy, he was piloting helicopters and serving in Vietnam.
After the autopsy, it should explain the physical condition of the pilot and whether it could not be the cause of the disaster.
The helicopter crashed about 5-10 minutes after the lift.
His breakdown looked wide on the rocky slope of the mountain, and the corps remained "dangerous", said air safety investigator Craig Hatchas of the National Transport Safety Board (NTSB) on Monday during the press conference.
The researchers intended to remove the fractures and then take a close look at them, but it would not be easy for the truck and the truck to reach that place, he said.
The cause of the disaster has not yet been identified and the preliminary NTSB report should be published within two weeks.
Israel's prime minister calls the entry into force of new sanctions on Iran "historical day"
"Today is a historic day," said Mr Netanyahu to members of his Likud parliamentary party, his office reported.
"Today is the day when, under the leadership of President (Donaldu) Short (Donaldu Tramp), the United States introduces particularly severe sanctions on Iran, the most severe sanctions on Iran all the time when efforts have been made to stifle its aggression," said the Israeli Government's leader.
Earlier Monday, Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman (Avigdor Lyberman) stated that the new sanctions would result in a "decided" blow to Israeli actions in the region.
The measures, which Washington calls "the strictest sanctions of all times", have started to apply the decision to withdraw from the global power agreement with Tehran on its nuclear programme, adopted after May.
Penalties are aimed at significantly reducing Iran's oil exports, which have been lost by about a million barrels a day since May, and at reversing Tehran from international financing.
Israel has long been opposed to this agreement with Iran and says that its scope and time limits are too limited.
The Jewish State also states that the abolition of sanctions provided for Iran with the possibility of financing groups of combatants and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's actions in neighbouring Syria and has promised not to allow it to adopt a military approach.
The other parties to the agreement with Iran - Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - do not agree with the United States decision and say that the agreement, as envisaged, has so far prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
The Court reiterates the circumstances of the death of a young motorcyclist
The death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, Northern Town, after an accident, the court will hear the witness’s testimony.
On Tuesday, the Vilnius District Court decided that, in order to clarify all the relevant circumstances of the case, one witness would be questioned at the next meeting on 26 November.
This case has already been brought before the Court of Justice, but it does not agree with it.
On 22 August, the Vilnius City District Court for the death of a motorcyclist killed a driver of the car, when Eduardo Osipov, 79 years of age, announced that the motorcyclist in the city had been driving at a high speed and had committed a serious breach.
The District Prosecutor's Office of Vilnius requests the district court to revoke the judgment of the District Court and claims that the greatest charge is on E. Osipovi for the accident and that the conclusions of the District Court are not justified.
A lawyer from the family of a deceased motorcyclist is also requested to withdraw the judgment.
The accident took place on 11 August 2015 at about 15 a.m. when E. Osipovo’s Skoda Fabia car from Lakūna street entered the street of Žirmūna and hit the main road bike.
The prosecutor's office accused the man of violating road traffic rules and causing a traffic incident - a man who was killed by the main road bike of Piaggo.
The initial police reports indicate that the driver of the motor vehicle died, but later after the tests, it is established that the vehicle is capable of being compared to the motorcycle.
The judge of the Vilnius District Court, Roland Bužinskas BNS, has said that experts have found that the motorcyclist was driving 89.2 kilometres per hour, although the speed allowed is 50 kilometres per hour.
"The driver couldn't predict that the motorcycle would drive at such high speed," said the judge.
At that time, a respected car driver confirmed that he had been driving just 5-6 kilometers per hour.
The driver of the bike, who had lost track of the road, tried to stop and fell off the vehicle before meeting Schkoda Fabia.
The prosecutor’s office believes that on the side of the road, E. Osipov had to give his way to a motorcyclist.
Novaja Gazettea: Six Vagner Squads in Syria
Among the dead are five Syrian military forces and six persons belonging to the military company Vagner.
This is announced by the New Journal in Syria.
According to a source located in that territory, one of the 5th Syrian military corps has been deployed, joined by a number of Syrian volunteers and "military personnel".
New Gazette sent an inquiry to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a request for information on the fate of Russians.
The former king of Belgium will have to carry out a paternity test
This decision is a partial victory by artist Delphine Boel.
Since 2013, it has sought to be recognized as a former monarch child.
A 50-year-old woman claims that her mother-in-law, Sybille de Selys Longchamps, and Albert II, had a short romance of love decades ago.
The former king of the 84th century denied his fatherhood.
According to RTBF, he may refer to the Supreme Court contrary to DNA.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Boelis - the former husband of Delphine's mother - neither biological nor legal is the father of the artist.
The relevant investigation asked Delphine to be recognized as the "true" father's daughter Albert.
Money allocated to the parties in the PRC, but not to social workers
This week, the Central Electoral Commission (CEC) intends to allocate a budget grant of almost EUR 3 million to the largest political parties.
The ruling Lithuanian Social Democrats working party (LSDP) established this spring, led by Vice-President Gedimino Kirkilo of Parliament, has not yet been scheduled to allocate funds from the budget.
However, they may be allocated to a separate decision of the GOC in the near future if the legal environment changes, regulating the allocation of grants to parties.
Laura Matjošaityte, President of the UK, informed the U.S. that "the Commission's meeting is scheduled for Thursday, which plans to take a decision on the half-year allocation of the budget to the parties".
It considers that the decision on this matter must be taken by the CCC by 15 November.
It is envisaged that the seven parties, six of which are parliamentary, will be allocated EUR 2,751 million.
The opposition Union of Fathers-Lithuania Christians should receive more than EUR 0.66 million, the ruling Union of States and the Green Union - around EUR 0.55 million, the opposition Party of Social Democrats - about EUR 0.5 million, the opposition Alliance of Liberals - almost EUR 0.4 million, the non-member working parties of the European Union - about EUR 0.23 million, the recent ruling Party of Tvarkos and Justice - almost EUR 0.22 million, representing Parliament, but not the ruling or non-opposing Polish-Christian family union – about EUR 0.18 million.
In accordance with the law currently in force, which also allocates funds to the VRC, grants shall be made to parties which comply with the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of the votes during the last elections of the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current regulatory framework does not allow the LSDDP established this spring to expect money from the budget.
On the other hand, this party has not yet participated in any elections.
It is true that the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that social workers can get at least a few hundred thousand euros in the next year's elections - the municipal, the president and the European Parliament.
Corrigendum to the laws of the political parties adopted by the Seimas and this year's budget was adopted by President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The Seimas has not yet decided on this veto, but the ruling representatives of Mr Kirkils and the Greens leader Ramūnas Karbauskis believe that parliamentarians will try to reject the President's objections.
However, it will not be possible to do so until this Thursday's UKC meeting, and therefore, according to Mr Matjošaitės, "the grants will be allocated in accordance with the legal order which has existed so far".
In fact, the Head of the UK did not reject that if Seimas rejected the President’s veto this week and the new amendments to the budget allocation of lots, the Commission could consider a decision on the granting of an additional grant to individual political forces, including the LSDDP.
"When we take the decision, we will take into account the entire legal environment in force, because we are the executive body with which to implement the laws adopted," she said.
If the Seimas were able to reject veto and the new laws would enter into force, the Government would be exempt from their additional money to the parties, which would have been additionally lent to it.
The seven parties already allocated grants for such a decision would not be affected.

Poroshenko: Activists Handziuk's killing orders must be punished
"I want to say that no version - and today more than 20 - will be rejected.
Each will be carefully checked in accordance with the investigation procedures.
As President, I do not have the opportunity and I do not have to receive information that could harm the course of the investigation.
However, the authority must ensure transparency, and the law enforcement authorities must work effectively.
This is the only way to get to know the truth and punish the bad," said Mr Poroshenko at a meeting with a young man in Kiev on Tuesday.
He stressed that he is the most interested in all of them, so that the murder of Mr Handziuk would be explained and that the murderers, the crime organizers and the commanders would "take the necessary responsibility".
"After this case has been reclassified as a murder (case), they are fully right and reasonably threatened by imprisonment to a life sentence," said the President of Ukraine.
He rightly called the requirement of the public to investigate this case openly and impartially.
Mr Poroshenko stressed that the statements made by the representatives of the law enforcement authorities in Parliament should show that "the government has resolutely decided to involve criminals and murderers in responsibility for what they would be".
He also said that political speculations on this subject would not help to explain the situation, but even more confused.
"I call upon all, both the authorities, and the forces that support the opposition, not to use unfounded arguments and, defend God, not to use this killing for public relations," said the President.
- On the contrary, we now need to unite and ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and clear, quickly, so that it builds public confidence.
There's just no other way."
"No one will be allowed to use this situation to destabilise the country," he said.
Before the corruption was fought, in July, Handziuk was attacked and surrounded by acid in the city of Cherson.
She was an advisor to this southern Ukrainian city.
The woman was hospitalized after the attack, but on Sunday she died in the hospital.
After the police and prosecutors were not informed of this attack, Ukrainian Attorney General Jury Lucenka made a statement of resignation on Tuesday.
After her death, officials accused the public of not being able to carry out a proper investigation.
Activists also demanded the resignation of the Attorney General and the Minister of the Interior.
"I am presenting my resignation statement today," Mr Lucenka told Members of Parliament, reading my study report.
Parliament must still support the prosecutor's resignation.
Mr Lucenka accused the activists of putting pressure on the investigation and of obtaining important information and therefore it is difficult to identify the perpetrators of the killing of Mr Handzik.
Bill Gates presented the toilet without water
By delivering futuristic toilets, Bill Gates' transition from traditional facilities to non-aquatics is compared to the revolution of the last eight decades computers.
Microsoft's founder Bill Gates presented a high-tech toilet in Beijing, which does not need water supply, reports Reuters.
Toilet without water works according to the principle of the separation of solid and liquid waste.
Both types of waste are processed into chemical fertilisers.
"The technologies you see here are the greatest achievements in sanitation over the past 200 years," - Bill Gates quoted Bloomberg as saying.
The technological toilet was created with the funds of a charity fund set up by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
During the seven years, the fund spent $200 million on a facility that could convert human waste into fertilisers or water.
All in all, Bill Gates said, there were about 20 toilet models.
The device is now closed and can be sold.
However, in order for such toilets to be produced in mass, the Gates Fund is ready to release another 200 million.
According to the Street Fund, poor sanitation worldwide kills 500 thousand children every year for up to five years.
Combating poor sanitation problems, such as cholera and others, increases the amount spent on health care, which has already reached 233 billion.
To better illustrate the sanitary situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates presented a glass of faeces in the toilet.
According to him, this is a good reminder that in a small example "there may be 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200 thousand bacteria causing infectious diseases, 100 thousand feral parasites."
S. Slyva elected president of the mass football association
On 5 November Kaunas held an extraordinary Lithuanian Mass Football Association meeting, where Sergey Slyva was elected the new president of the organisation.
An extraordinary general meeting of the members of the association was convened as a result of the request received by Anatolian Stevenk to resign from the office of president of the association.
It was attended by 13 members from 15.

Concern in France: Concerns about the death of people
On Monday, French health officials announced a permanent ban on widely used pesticides, causing concern over a number of recent decades of people who have been poisoned in the country’s west.
The ANSES Health Agency announced that the decision to ban all products with pesticides was adopted after a new safety check started earlier this year, even before at least three September, in the Department of the Arts and Luaras.
In these cases, the government has already stopped the use of pesticides.
This soil disinfection chemical should not be in contact with plants or farm workers.
In order to be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
In France it was used about 700 tons each year.
At least 70 people, including many farm workers, complained about breathing problems in the region where there are many salad juices, eye and throat.
"These episodes confirm the justice of our decision, but do not rush it," said French Vice-President Francoise Weber, Vice-President of the ANSES, to the newspaper West France on Monday.
Metam - one of the most commonly used pesticides in the United States and Europe - the US Environment Agency (EPA) considers it "probably human cancer".
This pesticide, sold by names such as Vapam and Sectagon, is authorised in Europe until 2022 when a new safety check has to be carried out.
"There was no other choice but to remove it from the market, whether it had alternatives," said F. Weber to that newspaper.
"We understand what difficulties will arise for salad juice growers, farmers in general, but public health is more important," she said.
Farmers have already expressed dissatisfaction with the government's decision last month to stop the use of methamphetamine in a region whose economy is heavily dependent on intensive agriculture.
In this region, close to Nanto, more than half of the 35,000 tonnes of salad juice consumed in Europe each year are grown.
The next season will be "a lot less salad juices, climbers and couples", last month, after the government has stopped using metam, AFP told the news agency, the leader of the Nanto Federation of Producers Philippe Retiere (Philip Retiere).

President Paul Biya, sworn to the seventh term of office in Cameroon after a controversial election
During the ceremony held by President Cavaye Yeguie Djibril for 85 years, Mr Biya promised to preserve the "unity and unity" of the West African state.
The former African President, who has ruled his country for 35 years, was announced in the winning elections on 7 October, with 71% voting.
However, the elections were subject to low voter activity, violence and suspected fraud.
In the evening of the Biyas inauguration, 79 students and three school staff, including the directors, were buried in one Presbyterian school in the North West region, where the English-speaking separatists carry out an armed campaign for independence.
The majority of the 22 million inhabitants of Cameroon are French-speaking and the fifth is English-speaking.
In 2016, in the North West and the neighbouring South West provinces, self-determination has begun to be required because of alleged discrimination in the fields of education, justice and economics.
In 2017 Mr. Biya refused to give up radicals and announced an independent state, the "Republic of the Amazon", and raised weapons.
According to non-governmental organisations, at least 400 civilian and more than 175 security officers have died this year in separatist attacks and government-responsive operations.
More than 300 thousand people have fled from violence: some are across the border to Nigeria, but many are forced to live half way through the woods.
During the elections in October, only 5% of the voters voted in the North-West region and 15% in the South-West province.
In both parts of the country, two thirds of the votes were cast by Mr Biya.
Original election of conservators: error caused by inexperience
"If anything is missing in places - understand that the party has organized everything with its resources.
Some municipalities have allowed access to their premises, but there were no voting booths everywhere, because we cannot buy them themselves.
Thanks to those who borrowed," said the politicians.
According to him, complaints have been received, but their contents do not change substantially, and violations themselves are not of a malicious nature.
"The complaint was.
Not all of the people in the elections were experienced - they were also new.
Thus, not all of our actions were consistent with our procedures.
Therefore, the CCC had to be warned to comply with the principles described by us.
These complaints are still not the basis for doubting the results," said A. Anuschauskas.
According to the president of the CRC, there were cases where ballots were not printed - when they learned that the ballots found in the ballots were cancelled without stamp.
Some cities lack seats, however, according to A. Anusausko, complaints and violations related to several tens of tickets.
"Well, since the difference is several thousand, this is really not the result of the election of the fundamental difference," explained A. Anuschauskas.
It is claimed that the number of party members in the elections reached 55%, while the number of non-partisan voters reached 69%.
Both candidates had 400 observers, and 600 people worked on commissions.
The results published on Sunday also do not change: 79% of voters (16418 votes) voted in favour of the winning Ingrid Shimonyta, while 21% (4441 votes for Vygauda Ušacka).
On 17 November, the TS-LKD Council will officially support the candidacy of I. Šimonytės in the election of the President of the country to take place next May.
Short says I'm probably not going to meet Putin in Paris
The National Security Adviser for the White House John Bolton said earlier that D. Short will meet with V. Putin in Paris, where this week will be the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.
However, in the last mythical elections before the U.S. Congressional elections, Dr. Short expressed doubts about whether this would be an appropriate opportunity to meet with the President of Russia.
"I'm not sure if we'll meet in Paris.
Probably not," said the President of the United States.
However, the White House leader was added, and I will see them during the G-20 Summit and "probably many times" after that.
D. Short is still trying to recharge relations with Moscow, despite the suspicion that Russia is interfering with the 2016 US Presidential elections.
Kęstutis Strupas requests the annulment of the VTEK decision
Former Director General Kęstutis Strupas of Vilnius University of Santara Clinics requests the annulment of the decision of the Main Official Ethics Commission (CETEC) - it has been recognised that undeclared transactions in time and thus violated the law.
On Tuesday, Mr Strupos’ complaint was examined by the Vilnius District Administrative Court.
The decision will be published on 26 November.
The applicant requests the annulment of the VTEK judgment on 23 May, the BNS notified by the court representative Sigita Jacinevičienė Baltaduona.
K. Struplas believes that the gifts to the neighbors must not be declared, he argues that the exception to the law should be understood.
On May, the VTEK announced that the then removed Director General of Santara Clinics K. Strupas and Head of the Hospital of Vilnius University of Ambulatory Rehabilitation, Silvija Strupienė, violated the provisions of the Law governing the declaration of private interest.
The investigation established that four transactions were declared not in compliance with the deadlines: a loan from the bank to the spouse in 2010, a loan from the bank in 2017, a gift from the daughter in 2017 - an apartment and a loan granted and not repaid to the spouse in 1996.
S. Strupienė also declared these transactions by passing the deadlines.
Persons who have violated the law on the coordination of public and private interests in the public service cannot be promoted for a year.
The Law requires not only its own but also its spouse’s data.
The study was carried out by VTEK on the basis of information from Info TV.
It is clear whether S. Strupienė and his spouse, Head of the Department of ambulatory rehabilitation of the University of Vilnius Hospital, declared their transactions in due course and in time.
As Info TV announced, last year K. Strupas gave his daughter a real estate worth 125 thousand euros.
However, the former Head of the Santara Clinic and his wife were not mentioned in their declarations of interest.
Law enforcement K. Strup, together with at least ten others, has reported suspicions in the corruption investigation - according to the law enforcement, for winning public computers, the purchase of software at clinics required from companies of illegal financial remuneration, it is masked as support.
In this way, K. Strupas is suspected to have said at least five times, during public procurement in Santara’s information technology clinics.
K. Strupas himself denies his guilt.
Corruption is suspected by Professor K. Strupas was released from the post of Head of Santara Clinic in September.
In the decision of the Ministry of Health and Vilnius University of Santara clinicians, the working relationship with K. Strupis should be terminated at his own request.
He led the hospital on 10 November 2013.
Santara clinics continue to be temporarily run by Professor Juozas Raistenskis until the competition to elect the new Director-General promises to publish it this year.

Speaking in the debate, Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė said that over the past ten years, over 30 million euros have been invested in the renewal of the content of education, but the results have not been seen.

Less standardised tests.
The general education programmes are promised to be digital, user-friendly, linked to e-resources, as a bank.
The aim of the renewal of the content of education is to improve the achievements of students in the international PISA study by at least 10%, with a third reduction in the gap between the achievements of students who have acquired modern competences at school being written in various areas.

Minister of Energy Mr. Vaičiūnas meets with representatives of Orlen Lithuania
As Elta informed the Minister of Energy Advisor Aurelia Vernickaitė, the meeting will address the achievement of renewable energy targets in the transport sector by 2020 and beyond 2020.
According to the European Commission (EC) data, transport is the only sector currently in line with the EU-wide energy share of renewable energy in the national renewable energy action plans.
According to the EC, progress towards a mandatory 10% target in the transport sector is relatively slow due to various difficulties, including relatively high greenhouse gas reduction costs and unclear regulation.
In this sector, renewable energy comes mainly from biofuels (88%) and electricity plays a lower role at this stage.
Seimas has taken up the issue of a proposal for a corruption study to supplement conservative applications to the KT
The Seimas approved a proposal which was registered for an investigation into the illegal influence of the political processes of the "state" Agnė Širinskienė on Tuesday after the submission.

Following its conclusion, the decision will be put to the vote on the amendment.
The Seimas Interim Investigation Commission, currently conducting a new political corruption investigation, is requested to explain the possible illegal impact in 2008-2016.
A. Širinskienė proposed to extend this term by stating that "in public space there has been significant information on the possible illegal influence and impact on political processes and public institutions".
A. Širinskienė describes in the project "the possible representation of the interests of pension funds in the legislative process or by appealing to the Constitutional Court or attempts to influence the decision-making processes of such important independent institutions as the Central Commission for Official Ethics".
The opposition Conservatives initiated the application to the Constitutional Court of Pensions.
The ruling "States" have found that the Conservatives have largely supported the arguments of private pension fund lawyers in their own motions.
The leaders of the "states" of the Supreme Commission of Official Ethics (VTEK) accuse the former mayor of Povila Urbš.
According to them, the former Chairman of the Management Committee of the Seimas State and Municipalities could appoint VTEK members to discharge the former Head of the Commission's Prevention Section, Mindaugas Nord.
At the end of September, the Seimas formed a commission to explain the possible illegal influence of stakeholders or their groups on the electoral process, on the formation of coalitions, on parliamentary groups, on the work of individual policies, on the activities of parties and on the financing of social movements, on the allocation of legislative processes, on the selection of members of State-run enterprises, on the management or supervisory bodies.
It is also proposed to consider what information the law enforcement and intelligence authorities have provided to the competent authorities as they have responded to it.
The researchers should submit their findings before 1 May of the following year.
At that time, there will be a campaign by the President, the European Parliament.
Of the 12 members of the Commission, seven are representatives of the "States".
Its members are also appointed by two social workers, one "order", a liberal and a representative of the Christian family union of the Polish elections in Lithuania.
The Conservatives and Social Democrats refused to participate in the Commission's work.
The new study was initiated by the President of the ruling Lithuanian states and the Green Union Ramūnas Karbauskis.
According to him, a study of the National Security and Defence Committee (NSCB) carried out last session showed, in principle, that the same things required to be continued.
The German Internal Intelligence Manager has lost his post
The 55th H.G. Maassen's controversy was further exacerbated by the statement that the "radical left forces" were responsible for his troubles at the Merkel Coalition.
As a result, he was not moved to another position as promised before, but was forced to leave the reserve.
Among other things, last week it became clear that at the meeting of representatives of European internal intelligence organisations in Warsaw a few weeks ago, Mr Maassen criticised Mr Merkel's immigration policy.
For a long time, German Minister for the Interior Horstas Seehofer, who defended the intelligence leader, said in a press conference on Monday that the previous comments of H.G. Maasen were unacceptable and "individually disillusioned".
Mr Seehofer, himself being pressured both by this dispute and by the poor appearance of his party in the Bavarian local elections, asked President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to release H.G. Maassen to the reserve.

Body girls break stereotypes about wedding dresses
The body of a girl with a white blouse of the tide dress - a mission (no) possible?
Can the white bed facing the altar be larger than the size of S or M and still appear attractive?
In addition to the reality of the show "Dyji (r) evolution" the participants will today prove that the beauty and elegance of the flood is certainly not dependent on the women's kilograms.
But that's not all - one of the project girls this evening will be in tears of happiness - will show up at the filming site by her boyfriend.
"There are still those who think that older girls don't care about men's attention or attitudes.
It's just a myth - my boyfriend himself is a sportsman, but he likes what I am, he doesn't require any figures that meet some standards from me," - before the show with the wedding dress is performed by Aurika.
The wedding dress is not easy, in every sense, clothes - it's a complex design, it has a lot of materials, a dress difficult, uncomfortable to move.
Also, some women think that a larger girl in a white dress will look even bigger and therefore have less confidence in herself.
I can rest assured that a properly-selected dress model really solves this "problem", - explained one of the members of the show, fashion designer Robert Kalinkin.
In the girl's fate project, R. Kalinkina is working together with the whole commission - plus the fashion house opened by Erika Vitulskiene, photographer and social network star Nagliu Bierancu and TV producer Laura Paukšte.
"When deciding which girl to say goodbye to the show, there are a lot of circles between the commission members - as we all represent different spheres and imagine the winner differently.
The task of demonstrating wedding dress has become even more difficult, and this - I can now reveal - is that there have been two young people who have certainly not been worse off than the old man.
It was a special evening in every sense," says R. Kalinkin.
In the scandalous behavior of 23 years of age in one summer reality show, Ieva and 31 years of exceptional beauty of two children, the mother of Dovilė - like the other girls participated in the selection of "Daddy's (r) evolution" and arrived at the best twenty.
Unfortunately, after the first very open girls’ photo session on the streets of Vilnius City, they had to say goodbye to the project.
The girl returned to the show by LNK viewers, voting for her favorites on the television portal.
The international recognition of the beauty of the body is already taking place in Lithuania for the second week - here plus the size girl is competing for the name of the first country plus the size star.
So far only eight are left - and they all know perfectly well that the winner can only be one.
The intriguing and unpredictable week of the reality show "Dydi's (r) evolution" begins this Monday evening at 8.30 p.m. during the LNK.
Actor I. Elba elected by the sexiest man in the world
The United States People magazine published this year the sexiest man in the world.
He became a 46-year-old British actor, Idris Elba.
Although the man claims that this knowledge was unexpected, he did not lack modesty when he spoke of the new title.
I thought, "You can't be!
Are you serious?
Then I looked at myself in the mirror and thought - yes, I look sexual today - laughing at the actor.
Speaking openly, Idris noted that this title is a very pleasant feeling that blinded his ego.
The British star is believed to have often waited on the words and customs of the monsters, who made his childhood difficult, because, as he puts it, he was "very tall and unlucky".
The young actor did not believe in and become an object of habit and because of his rare and unusual name and African origin.
"I'm just holding them together, and I'm becoming a solid guy in my city district," laughed Idris.
When a man doesn't need to be the greatest on Ose screens, I. Elba is working on a discussion in the evenings that are being held in Spain and especially in the noisy Ibiso.
A man enjoys the Thai box and has a wooden fashion that is made by making his own clothes.
The British actor believes that he is the most important person in the world - the family, so he plans weddings with the promised Sabrina Dhowre.
I. Elba became the most sexual man in the world selected for the 33rd People magazine.
The title was completed in 2017 by Blake Shelton.

Managers shall not require 20 km from the construction of waste incineration plants
The Vilnius cogeneration plant is located near the Gariūna market.
Governors no longer wish to maintain a 20-km distance from their homes in the construction of waste incineration plants.
The Head of the Committee on the Environment, "States" Kęstūtis Mažeika registered on Monday the amendment of the Waste Management Act which waives such a requirement.
According to Mr Mažeikos, the 'States' Group, which had previously maintained the provision on the 20 km distance, has promised to support the amendment on its refusal.
Mr Mažeika's amendment provides that as of January 2019, waste incineration plants could be built to meet the environmental and public health requirements laid down by law.
He acknowledges that the amendment prompted the President's doubts about such an insurance.
"In view of the definition of the area of residence, it is clear that such places where the above objects can be constructed are almost impossible to find," says the Committee president.
The ruling majority opposed the President's veto amendments in October to strengthen the construction of waste incineration plants.
In addition to the construction of waste incineration plants more than 20 km from housing, the corrections provided for an authorisation for the Government to take decisions on the future of the two electricity plants already under construction, taking into account the public health interests.
The latter provisions are not proposed by Mr Mažeika.
In Vilnius waste and biofuel, the state energy group "Lithuania energy" and Kaunas - together with the Finnish energy group "Fortum" in Fortum Heat Lithuania.
The latter is already burning waste in Klaipeda.
It is a possible compromise in Brexit negotiations
The British and Irish leaders discussed a possible compromise on Monday in addressing the difficult issue of Northern Ireland, which is undermining Brexit's negotiations, said Dublin.
In speaking on the phone, British Prime Minister Theresa May offered to review the so-called ‘insurance arrangement’ mechanism which would leave an open border between the Province of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland of the United Kingdom.
Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar promised to consider this proposal, but rejected any possibility for Britain to unilaterally withdraw from this agreement, says the Irish Government's report.
In the discussion, Mr May "was able to review the insurance mechanism", he said.
"The Governor has made it clear that he is open to reviewing new proposals, provided that the outcome of such a review is not related to the unilateral decision to terminate the application of insurance measures," says the Government's report.
Brexit negotiators do not have an acceptable solution to avoid checks at the UK and Ireland's land border when Britain withdraws from the Single Market and Customs Union next year's fight.
Both parties agree on "restrictive measures" to maintain an open border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland until a larger trade agreement is signed to ensure that additional customs checks at the border are not carried out.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants them to apply temporarily to the entire United Kingdom.
On Monday, The Daily Telegraph reported that the secretary of Brexit, Dominic Raabas, was seeking to allow Britain to withdraw from the insurance agreement unilaterally after three months.
However, Mr Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government "could not support it".
"The three-month or limited-term insurance measures are not worth the paper on which they will be written," he said.
Earlier, London and Brussels had not confirmed information on the breakthrough in Brexit negotiations after the week-long report in Britain that the agreement is being reached by hand.
"I would say that we continue to make progress in negotiations, but there is still work," said the representative of Mr May in London.
European Commission representative Margaritis Schina also told reporters: "We are not there yet."
Nobel Prize winners call for access to reliable information
On Monday, a group of prominent thinkers, including Nobel laureates, issued a declaration calling for the right to secure reliable information during the Internet era.
Among the 25 signatories to the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are the economists Amartya Sen (Amartya Old) and Joseph Stiglitz (Joseph Stiglic), the Nobel Peace Prize winner of Iran's lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi (Shirin Ebadi), as well as Nobel Prize winner writer Mario Vargas Llosa (Marius Vargasas Liosa).
"We urge the leaders of good will to take action across all the continents to strengthen democratic models and open public debates through which citizens can make decisions on the basis of facts," says the Group Report.
They argue that "global information and communication space" is a common good that "must be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and views".
"People have a fundamental right to obtain information that is freely collected, processed and disseminated on the basis of commitment, principles of pluralism and rational methods of fact-finding," the authors added.
The document calls for help from world leaders, including President Donald Trump of the United States (Donald Trump), often criticising "unreal news", but regularly accused of falsifying facts.
The world leaders should express their position on this issue when the meeting will be held in the "Peace Forum" in Paris from 11 to 13 November.
This declaration was made within two months, under the direction of the Head of the Freedom of the Media and Journalists 'Reporters Without Borders' (RSF), in Paris, under the leadership of Sh. Ebadi and Christophe Deloire.
Other signatories include former Senegalese President Abdou Diuffas (Abdu Diuffas), Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao and politician Francis Fukuyama (French Fukuyama).
The Seimas confirmed higher penalties for harmful products
The Seimas agreed with the amendments to the Product Safety Law providing that penalties for product safety infringements should be increased.
Corrections were adopted unanimously in the sitting.
As Mr Vinkus, a member of the Seimas Health Committee, said about the new project, welcomes the fact that the objectives set are related to better consumer protection of products.
Its provisions are also in line with the requirements of the European Parliament and of the Council decision.
"My head, in the proposed draft law, is better and more specifically distributed to all operators involved in the supply and distribution process: manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As practice shows, the current system of fines has not always prevented further violations, as the entities who have paid the fines continue to commit repeated infringements," said A. Vinkus.
The project was prepared by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and was complemented by its proposals by the Seimas Economic Committee, after the Government's approval.
The legislative amendments aim to increase penalties for infringements, to strengthen consumer protection, to empower market surveillance authorities and to establish a clear system of product safety requirements and their enforcement.
According to the Ministry of Economy, there is currently no obligation for producers to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability.
Furthermore, according to the Ministry, the market surveillance authorities have not been granted the right to access the territory of manufacturers and suppliers, buildings, premises, to carry out inspections and this makes the work of the institutions difficult.
The Ministry's assessment that the six-month deadline for the award of penalties and warnings is too short to determine the infringement, to carry out an investigation and to impose a fine.
Also, the ministries say the penalties set are not effective enough.
Companies often repeatedly violate the requirements of the law - only 14 companies did so in 2017.
The Ministry of Economy has proposed to impose an obligation on producers to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability to market surveillance authorities in order to make it easier for suppliers of non-compliant products to be clarified.
It is also proposed to grant market surveillance authorities the right to access the premises, premises, premises and inspections of operators who manufacture, supply products on the market.
The aim is to increase penalties for infringements of the law.
A fine of EUR 150 to 2 500 (now 144 to 1,448) would be awarded to the manufacturer, importer or authorised representative of dangerous products placed on the market and to the distributor, their supplier on the market.
A fine of EUR 1 000 to 5 000 (now EUR 868 to 4 344) would be awarded to the National Consumer Rights Authority (CPC) or another market surveillance authority if it decided to prohibit the placing on the market and the supply of dangerous products or the provision of dangerous services.
Without the requirement to remove dangerous products from the market, to recover them from consumers and to destroy them, a fine of EUR 2500 to 6 500 (now 1 448 to 5 792) would be granted.
If dangerous products caused harm to the health of the consumer, a fine of EUR 2500 to 15 000 (now EUR 1 448 to 11584) would be awarded.
If dangerous products caused the death of a consumer, a fine of EUR 6 500 to 25 000 (now EUR 5 792 to 23 169) would be awarded.
According to the Ministry, in Poland and Austria, a fine of up to 25 000 euros (no minimum fine is fixed), in Belgium - from 26 euros to 600 thousand euros, in Romania - from 155 euros to 6 666 euros, in Bulgaria - from 125 euros to 7,500 euros.

The Norwegian armed battalion participated in NATO exercises in the most remote and northern areas
The armies of the Norwegian armed forces took part in a series of difficult exercises in the mountains north of the capital of Oslo.
This is part of NATO's "Trišakė komnitis 2018" exercise - the largest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Most of the armies from the second Norwegian military battalion after the 11 September terrorist attacks spent a lot of time away from homes, in places like Afghanistan - that is, in warm countries.
But most of all, they are capable of fighting the Arctic, and these skills are very useful now that NATO changes its focus.
In recent days, in the east of Tinset, in the mountains, often in remote and northern areas, the military participated in staged battles against true British troops.
The soldiers have the ability to survive in this cold in the wild, but in the open climate they have a much higher weight on their feet - one weight about 50 kg.
The leaders say that they share with other NATO soldiers their skills in surviving and fighting under such conditions.
According to the military, these practices, which no one else especially remembers real warfare, will teach them to be prepared if there is a serious threat.

The Eastern European Centre for Studies will cooperate with two major US brain centres
According to RESC leader Lino Kojala, who has been in Vilnius for 13 years, the US will implement the projects and will make Lithuania's voice heard more on the other side of the Atlantic.
"We've been working this way for a few months.
I am pleased that the two major institutions see us as partners and seek opportunities for joint activities.
I have no doubt that the activities of the niches are also a priority for them," said Kojala, according to our analysis of NATO, security, disinformation, and the development themes of the Eastern Partnership countries.
The Agreement notes that RESC and the US institutions will work together in the preparation of international project applications, will be replaced by expert experience and knowledge, and will provide expert visits.
This should be of particular benefit to Lithuanian analysts, both partners having a good international reputation.
FPRI has been operating since 1955 and is uniting nearly one hundred top level analysts.
The most recent FPRI in the World Analytical Centres ranking at the University of Pennsylvania took the seventh place in its category.
At that time, the ECA, which have been invited to consult and work with the top U.S. political institutions, in the same rating, ranks ten in its category.
"This will provide more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to enter the U.S. information space and will encourage us to lift the quality card up high," added Kojala.
One of the first practical steps should be to assist partners in the distribution of the forthcoming RESC analytical publication "Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review" among US decision-makers and in public space.
The Eastern European Centre for Studies operates on the basis of projects to be implemented and no targeted grants are maintained.
Among the partners of RESC with which joint initiatives are implemented are the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.
