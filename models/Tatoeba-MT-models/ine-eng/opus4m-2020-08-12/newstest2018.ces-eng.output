The civil rights movement issued a travel alert for Missouri
The National Association for the Advantage of Colour People (NAACP) has published a warning for colour people travelling to Missouri on the basis of the State’s discriminatory principles and racist attacks.
‘The travel recommendation of NAACP for the state of Missouri, with effect from 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travellers, visitors and residents of Missouri to pay more attention to the series of controversial racially motivated incidents currently taking place throughout the country’, says the Association’s statement.
NAACP has stated that it has joined this step on the basis of the current laws of the state of Missouri, which facilitate the defence of racistly motivated acts before the court, as well as the conduct of criminal courts that are disproportionately aimed at minorities.
‘There is a violation of civil rights.
People are stopped by police just because of their skin color, are attacked or killed," said Kansas City Star President NAACP for Missouri Rod Chapel.
"So far, we have the greatest number of complaints."
This is the first warning of its kind, which the organisation has issued for the US.
Among the incidents that the organization was quoting were racially motivated tasks aimed at students of black skin at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a man of black skin from Tennessee.
Sanders died in controversial circumstances at the beginning of this year after he was travelling across the state and the police put him in custody without charge of committing a crime.
The travel recommendation also points out the recent statement by the highest state representative of Missouri, which states that black-haired drivers have a 75 % higher chance of stopping them.
"The purpose of the travel recommendation is to alert people and warn their families, friends and employees before what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People have to be prepared - they should take money with them at any bailout or inform their relatives that they are going to travel to the state."
According to the current figures of the FBI programme for reporting hate acts, hundreds of cases of hate occurred in Missouri in 2015, reaching the sixteenth place among all States.
Travel alert is also a response to the new Missouri law, which makes it easier to appeal to the company for discrimination in the provision of accommodation or employment.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Association (ACLU) issued a travel recommendation for Texas and Arizona after the States approved an immigration law allowing state actors to detain people on the basis of violations of this law, which is intended to improve racial profiling according to ACLU.
The travel recommendations are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but in recent times the legal groups have deviated from these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the United States.
The model was killed by the chef.
Her family doesn't even have peace after 12 years!
The killer is Sally Anne Bowman's model.
A girl from Croydon was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixi directly at the restaurant where she worked, and she was struck with stab wounds.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana, then killed her.
The killer then sat in a nearby café and watched a thorough criminal work of looking at the crime scene.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to release the freedom of 34 years for the murder and rape of Sally's model.
The judge admitted only a youth attack, and the lawyer claimed his client had already found the girl dead lying on the street.
Three years later, the police testified to him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sportson were arguing about fateful nights.
The killer said, "He was really angry, and after his attack, the girl started screaming."
"She even attracted the attention of the taxi driver," he said.
According to his statement, the girl was supposed to defend herself, but she could not.
Lewis was supposed to stab her on the street.
Dixie's version was proved a lie and accused him.
After admitting Dixie was talking about his diligence and taste for the girl.
When he dressed her up after sex, he felt satisfied and had to burn his marijuana.
Before the incident, Sally was with her ex-girlfriend, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, saying that to the police herself Dexie.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so she attacked her back and put her hand through her mouth," added the Mirror Linda.
And after 12 years of family fighting other attacks by vandals destroying her grave.
He's been damaged four times in the last half of the year.
There are so cruel people at liberty who dig these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," the Mirror's mother told Linda's missing girl about the disappearance of the urinalysis with ashes.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators are worth tens of thousands.
"The Czechs are neither dirty nor conservative," says Martin Ráz, who operates Prague's Intimity Store.
In it you will find design and luxurious erotic aids.
Including those from the Czech designer Anna Marešov.
It started incredibly, about twelve years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friends went on a bicycle trip to Moravia.
One of them brought not only the wheel, but also the boxes filled with unannounced vibrators.
"Various moles and dolphins and all that was green and yellow and just completely different," she tells me about lunch.
His friend decided to cooperate with another partner with the German manufacturer of Fun Factory’s design erotic aids, which Martina was interested in, so offered to help with marketing.
When a companion left to pursue other professions, he replaced him.
Today it operates in the Prague Benedict Street Intimity Store, where it sells erotic aids in the way luxury cables or shoes are usually offered.
And why not?
It's also about design objects.
Wait, wait, this is what you're talking about at lunch, you know?
Come on, don't be such a puritan!
Just Berlin's Fun Factory store, which proposed a renowned designer Karim Rashid, served as an inspiration for the Intimity store.
They opened it in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic commerce than everyone is used to.
No hidden items, all made in a beautiful, decent style, products exhibited more like perfumery.
Martin and his trading partner, Zdeněk Šebelka, began to consider how to understand Prague's trade, where it should be and what its name should be.
The name "Intimacy" fell in love with both of them.
"It's all about intimacy, and it's also, you know, gentle," he says.
It followed the purchase of internet domains and the search for suitable space, which went parallel to various interior visualizations.
Finally, she won the variant that spread the store into the garden of delight and bedroom, which leads to bed.
Dagmar Stépán from FormaFatal's studio prepared it for us.
We found space in 2013.
At first, he didn't seem completely ideal, because he's not on the main street, but he was sitting back in the name of the Intimacy.
It's intimate.
He's in the alley next to the main street, so no one's paying customers," says Martin Ráž.
We wanted to be the first.
We wanted to do a trade that would be different, with brandy nice goods, in an environment where women who are mainly our customers feel good.
And not to be ashamed that they got into such a business at all.
When I walked into the Intimity store half an hour ago, the street was empty.
Besides, I didn't even feel like I was going to the erotic aid store.
At the door, I was immediately surprised by the pure elegance of the interior that I know from fashion shops.
Although there's only a female service in the store to keep women from asking for help, it doesn't mean that a man's leg would not be welcome here.
Most gentlemen come here to buy presents for their girlfriend.
"Most men can't estimate the right size and prefer more," Martin smiles at the frequent error.
That's what these prejudices are, that you know, that women need some big help, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith may choose a huge vibrator.
Likewise, men choose mostly black clothes, which usually attract a woman to pink.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product called Satisfyer.
From the expression in my face, it must be clear that I don't know who's beating because Martin's explaining right now how he works.
It's such a touchless clitoris stimulator.
Pere needs a teenager in me to be amazed at the serious tone I've been given.
It's like it doesn't smell like it.
And she doesn't really smoke.
It is at a good price and has a perfect user reference.
We didn't think he'd be so well received.
It's some kind of last revolutionary news.
The first revolution caused a vibrator in the form of a sea horse.
He made sure that women became more interested in the design of such products.
The second was a vibrator for a couple of We-Vibe.
He completely collapsed a taboo that some men can survive, and the fact that they see competition in erotic aids.
"Various options are being made," he continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with remote control.
It's a favorite category.
In a loving connection, a woman can have control in her hands and determine the intensity of the vibration.
On the contrary, a certain failure is the category of attachment vibrators.
At least at our place.
The Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose aids and buy classic vibrators, although they may only use them externally.
However, in Western Europe, especially among younger customers, it is very popular.
What about the man?
It's hard to say if a similar concept works exclusively for men.
It's probably supposed to be a little different.
The question is what to offer men," Martin thinks.
"We also have help for them, but to a limited extent." Most of all, the masturbator is sold, in this case from the Tenga manufacturer.
It doesn't look like an anatomical pattern of vagina, but "slept like shower gel or like egg or futuristic object.
Much attention is paid to functionality and user experience.
It's completely different in Japan.
It's causing a fuss in me.
I thought the Japanese were going to suffer a lot of erotic aid, I'm not going to.
"That's the Internet reality," I'm explained.
That's completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more linked to the use of women.
In Japan they are perfectly normal for men, and on the contrary they are taboo for women." Just for the sake of interest - what the Japanese brand Tenga, represented in the Intimity shop, sells worldwide, still forms about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In Our Waters
The Czechs and the Czechs are not at all dirty.
On the contrary, we're a whole bunch of people.
Definitely unlike countries, such as Catholic Poland or Italy.
A typical business client moves between 35 and 50 years old and " already has some experience with sexual life, but with some help.
She will find something nicer, more quality than her partner's life or herself." Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdenek Šebelek are trying to make sure that every product is perfectly functional.
We also don't want to go into the special type of bondage and latex, because we don't have room for it, but it doesn't exactly happen here.
Such things could reflect those we try to reach out to.
Which are people who always had to go to the sex store because they were afraid they'd see something like that.
Many of the products displayed on the shelves are really popular.
It is also given by the selection of distinguished brands.
Some of them even won the design prizes, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first prized was the sea horse mentioned "and it made a change in the whole sector.
It started to get rid of cheap materials and, on the other hand, to work with healthy people, began to produce other designs, different colors...
It's a pleasure to have some of the designers behind the design of the Czech Republic, which is the popular designer Anna Marešová.
I have to say that I'm quite surprised how many people here buy those designer items Whoop.de.doo from Anna Marešová, even though they're relatively expensive.
They're customers who're going straight for Venus' bullets from Anna Marešov.
It really took a huge part of the work by representing, within the Czech Republic and abroad, exactly what we are trying to present - that erotic aids are allowed to do differently, nice, with a story.
Anna's story started as a schoolwork.
Now it's a finished product that's also made with us.
I wanted to have a process of production under control and I also wanted to know which materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are produced.
Because it's not a big deal, but a small series, it's definitely more expensive than a big series.
Maybe I'm going against the current a little bit, but I think it's important to keep our development in the Czech Republic.
It might well be that in a few years we will no longer be able to produce anything," Anna later tells me, who agrees with Martin that our company is as open as possible.
He doesn't meet with a negative or a negative attitude.
Most people are disappointed.
"But then you'll be smiling." Currently Anna Mareš has a vibrator offer that you can let prepare a personal message, and this year she is also planning her own lubrication gel.
The next year, she should have a vibrating egg and other news.
Limits on healthy sex
I'm interested in where the limits of what's right are.
Is there anything Martin Raž wouldn't sell anymore?
It's hard to define.
What happens to one person is normal, and the other one might seem completely abnormal, so we're going to define ourselves as a range of brand manufacturers.
None of them are allowed into any extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have the last question: What was the craziest question they got?
Right now, this week, he came by e-mail, where some lady was asking for a masturbation aid for her friend with a birth length of 20 centimeters.
So we had to write that we didn't have anything like that.
It's still a question of whether one of us has made a joke," Martin is measuring me with a suspicious view.
And it happens from time to time...
A wound to Karl Gott.
Two Alzheimer's cancers!
His friend Karel Städrý fights serious illness.
Karl Gott's best friend is fighting a disease that steals people all the memories.
"Yes, it's a pity the truth," confirmed the sad information of the singer himself.
I know about my illness, and so far, given the circumstances, I can handle it.
"I take drugs that are supposed to slow down the underlying symptoms of the disease," he added, thanks to the close support.
The entire enlightened family was determined to make Karl’s life easier.
Eva's wife is trying to be at home as much as possible, after her father's home on the White Mountain, the daughters of the first marriage of Zuzana and Theresa, the son of Karel named Karlas.
He struggled with cancer twice and shared his experience with Slavíkov to support him in his difficult treatment.
He's got sixty chemo.
He was able to get back to work after them at both the tennis court and the ski fairs.
"From an astrologer, I'm predicted to be here in the '90s," Karel Bleska said.
He's a fighter.
He still wants to sing.
"I'm still repeating the words of the song so I can't forget them," Karel admitted.
He's already fighting the same disease in the constitution and actress Flores.
Do you have a patient with Alzheimer's?
Look at how you treat him.
The Chilean parliament has abolished the ban on interruptions, the law of the U.S.A.
In Chile, an absolute ban on artificial abortion is still in force, so it must not be carried out for health reasons.
"I am sorry that the legislators have complained to the Constitutional Court and that ten people will now decide on what we have agreed in Parliament for more than two years," observed Socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members, and by the end of August it should have a new president who is, according to the AFP, a close opposition.
The law that disrupts the absolute ban on interruptions, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, approved the Senate on July 19th.
The right-wing opposition then announced that the law would attack the court because it states that it violates the right of the unborn child to life.
The voters postponed the bill last month until it was analysed by the Joint Parliamentary Commission.
On Wednesday, the Members approved the proposal and the Senate did so again.
According to the new legislative regulation, there should be no penalty for artificial interruption of pregnancy in three cases: if the life of a woman is threatened, if the fruit is not expected to survive, or if the pregnancy is caused by rape.
Similar exceptions existed according to the Spanish newspaper El País in Chile since 1931, i.e. before women were elected in 1949.
The absolute ban on interruptions in 1989 was introduced by the legal dictator Augusto Pinochet, just a few months before he left the president's office.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where there is an absolute ban on interruptions.
Others are Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
For example, in Salvador, there are now about 20 women behind bars, who have spent up to thirty years in prison for interrupting pregnancy.
In many cases, however, it was according to human rights defenders of the spontaneous execution, which the court identified as murder.
Is there anything else sacred?
The purpose of Trump's White House is now Socha Freedom
The unmistakable sign of change in the regime is the criticism of the drought.
The Americans could tell as well as everyone else - see the carefully staged rejection of Saddam Husayna’s soybean in the Baghdad Square of Firdos in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of Trump's regime, certainly knew what he was looking at when, in a passionate debate with reporter CNN Jim Acosta on the theme of the presidential proposals for the drastic restriction of legal immigrants, he emerged with a symbolic axe on Socha Freedom.
It's good to add that Miller didn't attack the drought like that.
For that, he would be enchanted by the gift of the owners of the voyage ships and the simulators of the Socha Freedom.
However, he attacked her importance, specifically the fact that in 1903 a poster was placed on the foundation with the famous poem Emmy Lazarus, up to 17 years after the monument was completed.
Miller rebuked Acosta for saying: “I don’t want to be left here in history, but Socha Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that sheds light on the whole world.
The poem that was placed on the foundation in addition and which you refer to is not part of it."
Miller's actually right, but as he himself said, this isn't about history.
These are particularly the offensive words of Emmy Lazarus, who reason today - not only the immigrants, but the poorest among them: "Let him come to me, who is poor, who is hardly breathing, who is poor in the midst of full cities."
And just in modern times we can better watch these "poor worms" on our screens than ever before.
Miller did not try to criticize poetry - he wanted to explain that these people are not welcome in the United States.
This conflict on the importance of socha is part of a comprehensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict on the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends, who, after her death, tried to put a poster with poems on the foundation of the soybean, knew quite well that she was going to go to a high political game.
Socha was to express the association of the French and American republican governments by representing a classic theme, that is, women's empowerment.
Emma Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female character is not abstract, but has its own voice.
He also has a very different name: the mother of the outcasts.
Relationship with a woman's imagination is a brilliant feminist pull and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And as Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the soybeans, right-wingers have long been trying to reverse that meaning.
The famous commentator Rush Limbaugh - Jana Baptiste in the matter of Trump's entry into power - in 2010 argued that Socha Freedom does not actually call anyone to the country, but represents early neo-constructivism, bringing the American flame to the rest of the world: "Socha Freedom goes forward.
It promotes freedom from the United States and offers it the rest of the world.
Origin is not intended to illuminate the road to the United States."
Limbaugh's buying's affecting an important thing.
The importance of soybean depends on the angle of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the sea from the point of view of the exhausted and doomed traveler, who often comes across the ocean after a long and fearsome voyage with hope in the heart of the new country.
This is literally a view of the world of people looking for shelter and a chance for a better life.
From this point of view, she expresses her hope and listens to their needs.
And that is, of course, a perspective that neither Miller nor Trump certainly knows.
Their origins are not meant to illuminate the path, but to propagate hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Sports Championship 2017: Neil Black sings praise to the Scottish members of the British team
Elidh Doyle recalls the time when the British team had only two Scottish members
The director of the United Kingdom athletic federation Neil Black said that a strong squad of 16 Scots in the World Championship team would be a "big benefit for the team".
For MS in London 2017, starting on Friday, a record number of Scottish athletes was selected.
Black believes that in Scotland "something special is happening" and British athletes could learn more from the Scotts.
"We are trying to understand and adapt - we will work on it," Black said.
“I spoke to people from the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they've done.
British athletics: it has something to do with what they did.
People on the streets think that too.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing."
Several Scottish athletes will strive for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000 m race, while Elidh Doyle was elected team captain.
“Eiligh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing," Black said.
“Several athletes, whether Scottish or athletes of other nationalities, came from a room with a sense of immense pride and motivation.
The passion and unscrupulous feelings that Eilid had spoken to were unrepeatable."
The silver medalist Commonwealth, who will compete in the course of a 400-metre obstacle to his fifth world championship, stated that he is "unbelievable", that there are 16 Scottish athletes in the British team.
The previous 1983 and 2015 record is seven.
On the middle track, Muir has only set five British and two European records in the last year.
The MS will take part in the course of 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scotts is Chris O'Hare, who runs the track at 1500 m. This season won the British team races and annual games.
Doyle remembers his first championship, where she was the only other Scottish member of Lee McConnell's team.
The team leader said she was very proud of the fact that not only a large number of her colleagues had been included in the team, but in many cases they would also be attacked for participation in the finals and medals.
"The extraordinary position of the team captain is that I was elected by the other team members. It was a great honor for me, but knowing that I was elected by the team members is a pleasure," she added.
“I am obviously very proud of all the Scotlands who have joined the team.
It proves where I moved.
They're athletes who'll think of the front seats on the stage.
What about my opening speech?
Yes, I think she did.
I just noticed the fact that we can be proud of this year's championship because it's happening on the home ground.
It is important to use the support of domestic fans and to rejoice at the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got a second chance at the race and I'm going to enjoy an unreal atmosphere."
Facebook Criticism Blocking: Don't worry about public function if you don't have a voter criticism
Our father knew about his criticism.
The American George Washington loved him, but it didn't take long for the press to start criticizing him for anything, starting with foreign politics and ending with his political opinions.
Yes, this criticism did not leave her cold.
But he didn't try to be critical.
Because in 1783 Washington said: “The freedom of expression can be taken away from us - and stupid, and we will be led as sheep to defeat by him.”
This brings me to Maryland is Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work for him to start acting like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and deleted at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, she was sued by the American Union for Civil Liberties for those acts.
The officials of the prosecutor rejected the complaint as unfounded and many opinions of the type “who cares”.
"It's just Facebook," said many users.
Still, it's up to it.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, it is an extremely popular Republican governor.
He can boast of the second highest favorite of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not urgent.
It is evident that its state is governed by its own principles and strictly adheres to its own principles.
It turned out that it is also a turning point in the use of Facebook as the main means of connecting with its voters - the exception is not even the publication of the first photo with a hollow head after the chemo.
Blocking people who welcome the governor's website - which is a public forum, designated as official and managed by his employees paid by taxpayers - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In a Washington Post Hogan's interview, spokesperson Amelia Chase defended the governor by blocking comments from the position of moderation of contributions.
However, using the image of Internet trolls, spammers or people who are divided is too easy.
Washington Post has told a few real people that have deleted their contributions.
And that is precisely what they are - real people who speak to their chosen leaders; teacher, businessman and pastor, no trolls.
As everyone said, their comments were courty and considerate, not rude.
In his comment, the pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramani's lawyer, Ms. asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hate.
"I have admittedly noted that I have been disappointed by his insufficient response to hate crimes and other current reports," she wrote in a section with comments from the Washington Post newspaper.
“I don’t like the idea that once a certain number of people have the same theme, some people are labeled for promoting so-called collective effort, instead of being regarded as a larger group of interested citizens.”
What the governor's employees call a "centred tax interest" would probably be called an "obhajabub".
Modern Facebook era allows us to manage contributions easily by blocking criticism or by deleting negative comments.
It is much more comfortable than in the past when the same procedure would require sending employees to the streets where they would collect and burn all the pressure with criticism or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that's exactly what's going on, just in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public figure to be criticised for the abuse of Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing a lawsuit by Twitter users that has been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
President Loudoon County Board of Supervisors violated James C. Cacherise's first add-in in Alexandria, where she banned one of her fans from accessing her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also visited ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington, D.C., the price of mail had almost the same effect as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily prints had doubled, and many anonymous writers had questioned its leader’s position.
And even in those days Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under aliases such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belissarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to the newspaper and questioned Washington's decision.
According to historical documents, which gathered people in the online project Papers of George Washington Project gathered in his office petitions criticizing his opinion on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation agreement with Britain.
But he didn't shut up.
Freedom of expression, disunity and intimidation lies in the very foundations of our nation.
And the real leader must accept it.
The Czechs used free roaming quickly, consuming more data abroad than at home.
In the Czech Republic, they consume more of their tariff than at home.
Most often they move in Austria, but the consumption of data during the summer season is led by Croatia.
On holiday, however, they have more time to browse the web, and under the sun, most of them have no access to Wi-Fi.
Beach, bathing and a smart phone in your hand.
So it looks like a typical Czech holiday in Croatia after customers can use the services of local operators at home prices.
This is from the fresh statistics of O2.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travellers abroad have more data available within the lounge than at home.
It is no wonder, therefore, that in Croatia, where there is a minimum of ours in the winter, the consumption of data has even increased by 50 per cent during this summer season.
In the second place, Italy was placed in the cage of the data consumed.
The Czechs spend most of their minutes in Germany, where many of them are out of work during the summer.
According to data from the Association of Czech Travel Offices, Croatia visits 800 thousand Czechs annually, so is our most popular holiday destination.
However, people here exchanged a book to share their experiences with their mobile phone.
The record was this year's 7th of July.
"To the data transmitted, there would be tens of millions of photos," she explained the details of the director of the mobile segment in O2 Silvia Cieslarová.
Even though Croatia leads in data, the largest number of Czech users are moving in neighbouring countries.
The first is Austria, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is fourth and Italy sixth.
We go to Austria for a walk and an active holiday, on which we do not have so much time to surf the Internet.
"In addition, through Austria, the Czech Republic is heading right to the Adriatic," Cieslarová explained.
While the data showed the operator after the release of high interannual growth roaming charges, the number of phone calls is much lower.
The number of minutes spent in roaming increased against last year to double.
With a huge leap in front of other countries here, Germany dominates.
"Calls in roaming are used rather by business customers on business routes," Cieslarová added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes in the domestic atmosphere at the Renaissance Club
The former Ronan Raferty golf team will hope for the next three days in the cool atmosphere of the Renaissance Club in the Scottish administrative area of East Lothian, which hosts the 25th anniversary of the Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who comes from Northern Ireland last year on the nearby Archerfield Links golf course, followed Paul Eales on his way to the final. This year he will play the role of Ambassador of the tournament in representing the founder of the club and CEO of Jerry Sarvadi.
"I watched the Renaissance Club slowly grow up in front of my eyes, and this year's tournament will show the world its beauty," said Raferty.
“Players will be able to love the first-class quality of the playground.
Jerry did a great job.
He's a burning defender of this game and he's proud of his achievements.
This year's tournament is in the right hands."
English Eales will be the first to defend the championship title, despite the fact that during his 32-year career he won the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"I feel good about it," said the Southport golfer.
“I did not have the opportunity to defend my victory at Extremadura Open, because the tournament was cancelled year after year.
The return to this part of the country is magical.
It's a nice golf place.
I remember last year when, for me and my wife, Sharon meant a real victory.
It's been a wonderful time I won't forget."
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after he celebrated 50 years from the country this year.
This event will be his first participation from Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always enjoy playing on the home floor," Orr said about Helensburg.
“You want it to work out for you and then you feel a lot of pressure.
I'm really glad I played again, and I think I'm doing it.
I'm happy with the result."
Three players will also be joined on the field by former Masters Ian Woosnam and the winning senior tournaments Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former competition captain Ryder Cup Sam Torrance are among the six Scottish players on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Free access to the tournament. Parking is 5 £ per car with one passenger and 10 £ per car with two and more passengers.
All profits will be paid to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in the country of gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use spores.
In fact, he's only rarely using a tire.
In his wooden cottage, located in the main city of Pania Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the words of local "note" - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, we'll take out the potatoes and enjoy them with unwashed hands.
Bardina sits on the muddy ground - the house is not equipped with furniture - where at the same time she does her daily work, such as washing clothes in the spicy water from nearby urine.
The bedding in the room without a roof is combined with the toilet.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, she was not assigned any fields of processing.
The polygamy is common here.
Working late at night poses a danger: most men from the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol. In addition, soldiers live in the village.
"In the afternoon after the fifth hour, no one will allow themselves to wander around the village," says Bardina.
It is a rare view of everyday life at the height of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was declared a part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote in the form of a public raise before the occupying army.
The current movement protesting the Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which controlled the entire region with the exception of foreign journalists or civil rights guards.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - the independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a remote and deserted city where you will arrive after ninety minutes from the capital of Jayapura to Nabire, and then a five-hour stomach playing the ride.
General transport in this place doesn't work.
A town of 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses covered with bamboo plots, roofs of woolen sheets in shades of grey and cut colour.
Only a very few Indonesians, but journalists, and practically no foreigners, were seen in this place.
Before the arrival of Christians, locals worshipped the name Uga Tamae.
And that's not all.
“We weren’t used to wearing these clothes,” says Bardina, pointing to her colorful, hand-made turbine, dark shirt and bright dress.
"We used to wear only leaves."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia - 28% of the population live below the poverty line and the child mortality and literacy is one of the worst in Asia.
At the same time, it is an Indonesian country of gold.
The largest and most generous gold mine in the world of Grassberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from the American Phoenix, is located only 60 miles from Pania - a rocky province about the size of New Jersey, which is home to about 153,000 inhabitants.
Only in 2015 did Freeport extract gold and copper in the value of $3.1 billion.
Furthermore, Papua supports the extraction of wood at the estimated value of $78 billion.
However, this wealth is a source of suffering and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army.
The investigation carried out in 2005 by the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid approximately $20 million to local military agents and units between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for one official.
Papuans calling for self-reliance threaten this gold hus and are therefore severely oppressed.
According to human rights activists, since 1969 more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
Mass killings in the Papui tribal area during the last 70 years amounted to genocide, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Only last year, more than 3,900 dead protesters were arrested by the Indonesian police in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, the report of the 2016 Brisbane Archdiocese, describes the cruelty that occurred last year, such as extrajudicial repairs, torture - according to another report is particularly popular rape and correction of electric currents - and brutal oppression of peaceful demonstrators.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims, because incidents occur every week," said Andreas Harrison, an Indonesian researcher at the Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation made it difficult for the papal resources to attract colonists to Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% report to Christianity, but demography changes with the flow of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands - Java, Bornea, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javan canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gaga or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting for survival.
"Immigrants began selling chicken and vegetables on traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans," explains twenty-four-year-old Abeth You, who was born in Pania and moved to the capital of Jayapura.
"The natives of Papua - mother (wives) - lost their jobs."
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, who is renamed Jokko, promised to resolve the injustice and violation of rights in his presidential campaign in 2014.
The former treasurer secured his journey to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Pania.
But in Papua, it has changed very little and local people feel hurt.
"Our heart was broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi, hoping to hear our call for justice," You said.
The fact is, just two months after the October inauguration of Jacob, Pania suffered a great shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang Christmas song at the camp fire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers came out of the lake at night on the motorbike.
Two of the surprised children told them they should turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers was touched by this and the tone to which she was addressed and later returned with four other soldiers, local lighthouse Yavedt Tebai said.
Two of the soldiers in the subordinate state followed a group of children and beat them with their weapons, presented victims and witnesses.
One of the soldiers then set fire to a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to a nearby electoral committee building and the next day things were still coming up.
About 1,000 young papal men and women gathered on the football field in front of the local police station and the military headquarters and demanded justice.
They came with the ritual hunting ports and performed the dance of wait - in which it runs in the circle and resembles the song of birds - the Papuan family Mee Pago.
Several Protestants started throwing stones at the building.
With increasing tension, the soldiers were ordered via the radio: “If the dav is tried at least three times, you have a permit to shoot,” according to the TIME weekly in an official document, the content of which has never been published in local media.
Jeremias Kayame (56), chief of the district of Enarotali Kego Koto, identified a dangerous danger and called on the residents to disperse into their homes.
However, no one had a problem with his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left arm," said TIME weekly on the porch of his wooden festival.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but according to him, the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people around and a lot of shooting," he added.
One of the local residents, Alfius Youw, was, according to his cousin, who was a witness to the shooting, struck immediately three times.
“I ran to the body to make sure it was really him,” said the WOMAN of TIME to John, who, as many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only "supplyed" the station that was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten us with death," said Pope's police press spokesman Pudjo Sulistio in 2015.
"It's a question of life and death."
According to the Human Rights Watch organization, five protesters were killed and many were injured.
The murder report was launched by the media the following day.
Three weeks later, he gave Jokow a passionate speech in Jayapura and expressed his understanding of the victims' families and promised to deal with violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it will never be repeated," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of National Security Wirtanto announced that he would introduce an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve the violent acts that have occurred in the past.
Almost immediately, however, they began to apologize.
“Most of the violent acts have occurred a long time ago.
Some of them occurred in the 1990s, and some in the early 21st century.
I mean, we are punishing the decisions of these violent acts, but it will not be a simple task," he said.
In a discussion on June 5th for the TIME weekly that took place in Jakarta, however, Wirtano claimed that he was not planning to take any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said that "all cases will be brought before the Court".
Viranto, accused of "crime against humanity" on the basis of more than one thousand deaths during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor, stated that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua New Guinea, including the Pania incident, have been settled.
The families of the victims of the shooting in Pania welcomed his claim with disbelief.
"In the last three years I've been questioned four times in total, but so far I haven't seen anything," John said.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear for a few years.
"I'm afraid," as they claim.
"I'm afraid an army will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many Pania residents who are afraid to speak about the incident.
According to his words, he was defeated by members of the army after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After the body was buried, I started looking for an army," he said.
And the shooting's not over yet.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in neighboring Deiyai.
A leak in which one person and 17 others were injured occurred between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to provide assistance in transporting a man unconsciously to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24), who drowned when fishing in the nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested before the building company.
According to the police, the villagers were throwing stones at them and their answers were a cautious shot.
Locals, however, claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the tank and killed one man.
"There was panic, we were afraid of payback," said Dominggu Badii, 29-year-old, who lived near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the injured.
"I didn't leave the house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament demanded the punishment of the police officers involved and the removal of the mobile brigade from the area.
Ladies and gentlemen, for the Indonesian government, I've always been an eyebrow.
Lack of meaningful development only deepens the distinction between the native peoples of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes living in central highlands.
Many of them joined the Movement for the Liberation of Papua New Guinea (OPM) - an army of rebels who protect the rights of the Papuans by attacking and kidnapping Indonesian policemen.
Some of the leaders of the OPM come from Pania, not from Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoy.
As a result of the attacks of the army in recent years, she has arrested and voluntarily detained thousands of Pania's inhabitants, all under the pretext of "protection of national sovereignty".
Some of them never belong anymore.
Paniai is known among the people of Papua as "a tragic and forgotten place".
Oil is sinking into the fire of poverty.
The little rice that is sold in Enarotali is for local too expensive.
And bread is as unattainable.
The people here grow their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruits and leafy vegetables.
Women work in fields, each handling four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most baskets are intended for family needs, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes are worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire Airport opened several air routes and new immigrants began to flow to the country, there is an increase in economic inequality between the natives of Papua New Guinea and immigrants.
There are already so few jobs occupied by more educated and richer immigrants.
Papuans often have the capital and education needed to get into business.
"Young people are moving out of the village because of the lack of employment opportunities and money," said John Gobai, President of the Pania Tribe Council.
As a result of isolation, the province of Papua is hidden from the world.
They also contribute to the strict rules for foreign journalists.
At the beginning of this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - were expelled from the pope because of “the lack of cooperation with the authorities”, despite the fact that they received such rare permission to film.
Phelim China, Deputy Director of the Asian Branch of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi in his election campaign promised to abolish strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development. However, this never happened.
"For foreign journalists working in the most rebellious eastern regions of Papua and West Papua, there is a great risk of not recognizing visas and entering the blacklist," he said in a statement.
The lack of reports from per foreign journalists means that the international pressure on Indonesia in the case of Papua is significantly limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council on the investigation of “different and widespread violence” in Papua, including shooting in Pania.
These countries in the past also supported the OPM.
The Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Arrmanatha Nasir filed an indictment when he told reporters in Jakarta: “In Indonesia, the democratic system and the media are still free, so it is difficult to mask evidence of human rights violations.”
Local people call after the participation of foreign governments.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the envoy for human rights, Kees Van Baar visited Jayapura on 4 May, the local people were experiencing a source that also attended the meeting, but wanted to remain anonymous, the password "we want freedom".
For 2019, further elections are planned in Indonesia, but the popes claim that they will not vote for Jokowi.
"Yoko is a man who has good intentions, but is surrounded by people associated with the shooting in Pania," Gobau, president of the tribal council said.
He wants Joko to know that the inhabitants of Paniai - besides living in constant fear of the robbery army - are fighting in poverty, poor education and the health system.
Gobai claims that the inhabitants of Pania, as well as the other Papuans, consider their vote to be "debt", which must pay Joka.
"They don't want money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the family of the victims of the Pania shoots, they continue in the last symbolic act of the resistance: burying the bodies of the victims on the ground against the police and the army station.
Knowing that justice will never be done enough, at least not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus said with a closed head.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy caught a huge supply of cocaine to Australia.
In the Pacific, the French Navy retained a 1,46 tons of cocaine worth about $256 million.
The plant was headed for Australia.
In the attack, a four-member crew was arrested, which is likely to be made up of people from Lithuania and Latvia.
Jachta, named Afalina, sailed from South America and the police dragged her to the port of Nouméa, a metropolis of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific.
The Australian Reporting Service stated that, in cooperation with its international partners, it would strive to determine exactly where and where the drugs were being directed and to identify the "Legal Trade Union".
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures that have stopped a large number of drugs leading to Australia," said Executive Director Col Blanch.
The drugs were destroyed in Noumé this week.
Australia is an attractive destination for its pets due to high street prices.
The country is also facing the problem of the growing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current appeal is not the first one lately.
Last month, three men were accused of transporting large quantities of drugs from the United States to Australia, who tried to cross the Pacific in a small plane.
Seniors don't feel thirsty. They need to remember.
The problem may be in the homes for seniors, according to a doctor at the Geriatric Clinic, the General Faculty Hospital in Prague Pavly Mádlová could be an infusion of a physiological solution that boils with a thin needle under the skin.
But so far, you're only applying to medical facilities.
The older the person, the lower the amount of water in his body.
"In addition, it loses its feeling of thirst, so seniors generally take less fluid and dehydrate very quickly," said Madlová.
Two liters should definitely drink.
"But getting so much fluid into the old man is a big problem," she added.
In senior homes, she often finds that no doctor is watching.
In hospitals, dehydration is usually done by infusions.
"I think there should be a gradual introduction even there so they can get a subcutaneous infusion," she said.
According to her, old people can add up to two half litres of physiological solution per day.
Lack of fluids may cause weakness, headache, and reduced performance.
Dehydration appears as a complete loss of self-resistance.
"One day the old man will say he can't get out of bed, he's talking confused," she added.
In the event of neglect, it may develop into a brain accident.
Blood will close and ocquer the nerve in the brain, also threatens the failure of the kidneys.
Lying patients should not be covered with a wig, which is maximally cotton.
The problem can also be one-time prey.
"It is more difficult to treat, but it would be ideal for the patient to sometimes discover and let the skin explode," the doctor said.
The Torch has already burned the second cloud in Dubai
In Dubai, on Friday, one of the world's largest settlements was in flames. The Hassites had to evacuate all inhabitants 337 meters high and 79 floors.
In the last two years, it is already the second fire of this college building, which bears the appropriate name The Torch.
All the inhabitants of the building were evacuated and there was no injury. The cause of the fire is unknown.
“We fell asleep and woke up the alarm. We heard a scream.
It took us ten minutes before we ran down from the 50th floor," he told Reuters Geroge, one of the people of the dragon.
The Dubai Civil Defence stated that firemen managed to get under control around the fourth hour of the morning (0:00 GMT) and continued to cool the building.
Government representatives have added that they provide replacement accommodation for the disabled.
The incident could once again lead to a discussion about the safety of materials used to cover high buildings around the world.
From the results of the investigation initiated by the launch of the Torch skyscraper after the fire in 2015, it was found that the coating and external panels used for decoration or insulation were most damaged.
The British police indicated that the system of insulation and coating of the London Grenfell Tower could contribute to the rapid spread of the fire at the Red Fire, which killed nearly 80 people.
The results of the survey showed that more than one in five passengers to the United States are carrying prohibited items on board an aircraft
A survey among passengers showed that more than 20 per cent of them knowingly or unknowingly reported prohibited items via the U.S. Government Transportation Security Administration control agency on board the aircraft. At least six per cent of passengers entered the aircraft with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers claim to have found out that they were travelling by gun, ammunition, or explosives.
From the results of the survey carried out by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - which answered more than 1000 respondents - it was concluded that there is a greater likelihood of a violation of the rules among younger travellers.
Of the respondents who admitted that they tried to make a conscious attempt to travel with the object prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 per cent of the passengers with several thousand hours of flying compared to less than 15 per cent of the members of the X generation.
Among the most common objects that have avoided TSA attention are food and alcohol.
More than three per cent of respondents were aware of the threat of a sharp object, while 2.2 per cent of the women and 3.7 per cent of the men surveyed also admitted that they deliberately put the prohibited drugs on board the aircraft.
The company stated that it had conducted research among travellers around the world to find out how many of them had accidentally carried out illegal items through airport controls and how much had done so successfully.
It is not surprising that most people who have carried illegal objects - whether they are aware or unaware - travel by plane very often.
As the company pointed out, the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often don't know what fluids and how much they can carry into the plane.
It is not surprising, therefore, that TSA has played in the largest amount of fluid that has just been banned.
For some time, people thought that TSA would handle books in the same way as stuffed goods.
The transfer of fluids is permitted within foreign flights, not international.
Head of EPA Scott Pruitt on deferral of planned guidelines to reduce emissions from the Obama administration
After 15 states were complained by the Environmental Protection Agency, her former head Scott Pruitt withdrew his decision to postpone the implementation of the plan of the former Obama administration for reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt presented changes within his plan. He is more responsive than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal challenge raised against his previous position in the Federal Court of Appeal.
This concerns the last deadline fixed on 1 October when States should begin to comply with the 2015 Regulation for the reduction of ground ozone.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would postpone the agreement for one year and arrange a more detailed study of the plan to avoid "interventions with local decisions or threatening economic growth".
Pruitt, who, before becoming the head of the EPA, was President Donald Trump, held the position of State Attorney General Oklahomy, served for a long time as a reliable supporter of stricter environmental regulations.
Since its establishment in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or remoted the regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industry.
The immediate centralisation is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA operator exceeded its authority in an attempt to delay the membership of the Obama administration plan, which required oil and gas companies to reduce the leakage of methane.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed its version of the ozone standards and reinforced the EPA's commitment to cooperation with States through complex processes and the implementation of new standards within the time frame.
"The previous administration of the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines and waited for it to be sued by the activist groups and others, agreeing with the alignment and other planning," said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen complaints in his previous position to the EPA.
"We do not believe in regulation through judicial dispute and the fulfilment of the deadline is taken seriously.
We never look at our status and the authority that comes from it."
However, the EPA declaration states that Pruitt can use "the possibility of extension and all other legally available authorities" in a certain point to ensure that regulations "will be based on sound policies and the most accessible information".
The Republicans at the Congress press for a broader revision of the ozone rules.
Budget of the White House approved last month seeks to postpone implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measures have not yet been passed on to the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who was in the forefront of the coalition of states that complained this week of the EPA, stated that the group was not going to allow legal pressure.
"To turn to the EPA's opinions - following our judicial review - is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million new citizens and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by air pollution," Schneiderman added.
She joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
The ground ozone occurs when conventional harmful substances released cars, plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive people and every year thousands of premature deaths.
Public health defenders and environmentalists welcome the sudden change in Pruitt.
"It's worrying what pressure it takes to develop to change the thinking of responsible people and protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd from the Biodiversity Centre.
"We must continue to fight the ideological pull of Trump's administration, which is trying to help polluters and special interests."
He's poking men with acid, but it's not dangerous in court.
You never know what can happen to you.
One moment you're home with your family and you're laughing, and the other moment you're gonna change your whole life from basics.
And the worst part is, you can't do anything about it at all.
Similarly, Andreas Christopheros from Great Britain met an unknown attacker who was finally acquitted of his guilt.
Information was introduced by Web Reuters.
In December 2014, someone knocked on the door at the Christopheros.
Andreas rose up to go open.
He thought there was probably a courier at the door who was supposed to deliver the Christmas gift for the family.
Instead, there was a cruel surprise waiting for him.
A man who never saw him in his life immediately after he opened it without warning poured acid with the words, "This is for you, my friend."
That pain was indescribable.
The clothes fell on me like nothing, and I just felt a real pain in the skin," Andreas said.
His family rushed him to the hospital, but his close friends learned the terrible news - according to doctors he had no chance of surviving.
Several weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly afraid that their patient would suffer from an infection that threatened to enter his wound.
His injury was very serious.
Of the ninety percent, a face was struck by doctors trying to bring the skin together from other parts of the body.
A major complication for Christopher became the loss of the eyelids.
It's probably the most painful thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide from the unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he described his suffering.
Today Christopheros has twelve operations that are not far from the last.
The injuries that victims of acid attacks may require hundreds of surgical procedures and years of treatment, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after heavy and long-term treatment, the victims have tissue detected for the rest of their life.
"Sometimes people don't go back and fight deformation and eviction all their life," said Professor Peter Dzewulski, a spokesperson for British associations of plastic and aesthetic surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
As for the attack, Christopheros is certain that an unknown man had to break up with someone.
Pachatel believed that he was avenged on a man who sexually abused his close friend.
The police have been investigating the whole case properly, and the attacker has been investigating afterwards.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
Later, however, the verdict to the miracle of the Christophers family changed fundamentally.
"The three judges finally concluded that the punishment should be abolished, because a man is not considered a threat to the public," Christopheros said.
In the last few years, the number of obesity attacks has increased significantly.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs expressed its intention to lay down new guidelines for state representatives on the classification of fats.
You should be listed between dangerous weapons.
However, victims of similar attacks are not prepared to give up.
They demand that the British government impose more severe and longer sentences of deprivation of liberty on people who attack their surroundings with acid or other fatty substances.
They also require increased controls on the sale of dangerous substances, which are often available in different trades, as these are different cleaning products.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai burned a famous skyscraper, The Torch, which is one of the largest buildings in the world.
According to the Dubai Civil Defense, the inhabitants of the eighty-patriotic building were able to evacuate in time and no one was injured.
According to the speakers' police, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread upwards.
According to some, however, it was the opposite.
"It started on the 67th floor, so they told us," said one of the tenants.
Also, according to another tenant, quoted by agency Reuters, the fire broke out in the highest floors and spread down with falling fiery tears.
We slept.
He woke us up, people shouted.
"We ran down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," said Lt. George.
Another witness for CNN estimated that the fires had taken over about 40 apartments.
On the ground fire destroyed at least two cars when they hit the burning part of the building.
About two hours later, according to the civil defense report, the fire was able to get under control.
The cause of his origin is not known yet.
According to the witnesses in the surrounding buildings, there was a flow.
The vast fire damaged Dubai’s skyscraper The Torch also in February 2015, destroyed over a hundred apartments.
There are about 680 apartments in the entire building.
Even then, nothing happened to anyone because the people were able to evacuate in time.
The Torch cloud was built in 2011 and then became the world’s tallest building world with its 352 meters.
The record was prepared immediately next year by another Dubai skyscraper.
The culturalist had 14 incredible doping substances in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to Corriere della Serra, in a sample of Ippolita for the age of three decades, there was a cluster of illicit drugs from steroids through diuretics after Parkinson’s disease or anorexia.
Paradoxically, this wild mix didn't help him with his title, ended the fourth.
Now culturalists are threatening four years of distance and criminal harassment.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian ragbist David Vasta was positively tested for 11 doping substances, which has been a record quantity for the caught athletes.
According to his words, a third-party player began taking steroids a year before he lost his culture.
Lucka Vondraczová, Czech Republic.
She was passionately hugging her ex-girlfriend!
Almost Lucka Vondračová entered the territory of the Czech Republic, is in one circle.
And he's also paying attention wherever he comes from.
The last time she got into the arms of her former lover Michal Longy, who lived with her for three years.
At the time, the actor was 12 years old and was already looking for his family.
Lucia was only 19 years old at the time, and she certainly didn't complain about hanging her career on the back.
So they went away from each other, but friends stayed there till today.
Which they also proved at the TV Prima press conference, where they met for a long time.
By coincidence, they both agreed in blue.
At first, they didn't notice themselves, but then they got close and Lucie laughed at Michal's jokes when she fell over her stomach.
Then they hugged each other and called the photographers.
Their meetings were not a coincidence, however, because they were playing together a couple of lovers in the new Primy Captain Exner series.
In Britain, Islamists were given life to prepare for the assassination.
On Thursday, the British court sent four members of the Islamist cell to live on the net, who were called Three Musketeers and who were planning a terrorist attack on the police and the army.
Four men, two of whom participated in the training camp in Pakistan and were previously convicted of similar acts, were arrested in August.
At the time, the authorities thought they were going to attack immediately.
In the car of one of the men, security agents found a partially finished tube bomb, knives with inscriptions that in Arabic mean "unbelievers", and a machine gun.
It happened at a time when the MI5 Secret Service Agent put a listening device in the vehicle.
"The recent assassinations have shown what fear the prosecution might have caused if they hadn't been stopped," prosecutor Sue Hemming said.
Three convictions at 28, 25 and 33 years of age may apply for release after 20 years.
The fourth judge, 38 years old, can do it after 15 years behind bars.
The men in London said they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car were placed there by MI5.
The court also heard it, but then denied the defendant's claim.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
They measured 38.3 °C for Hodonin.
The internal temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsia remained at the top for only two days.
With the 38.3 degrees Celsia, which were recorded in The Watchtower in Hodoninsk, he conquered it on Thursday, which has become the warmest day of this year.
This was confirmed by the Czech hydrometeorological institutions.
On the contrary, on Tuesday, but on Thursday, there were not many temperature records.
On Tuesday, 35 of 145 meteorological stations measuring more than 30 years have been defeated or levelled.
On Thursday, record temperatures were recorded for only nine long-term measuring stations.
Perhaps in The Watchtower the quarterly temperature was the same as the previous 2013 record.
In the Lednica to Breclav on Thursdays 37,4 degrees, the original maximum of four tenths of degrees was exceeded and the current record of three tenths was exceeded by 37.1 degrees in the Pohrélices in Brno.
Both records came from 2013 as well as from Watchtower.
In the west it was ten degrees less.
High temperatures appeared on Thursday mainly south and east of Moravia.
After the Watch Tower, there was the largest wind in the Dyjakovićs on Znojemska and the Brod nad Dyjjs on Bréclavska, where the mercury flowed to 37,8 degrees, but the record did not exceed.
On the contrary, in the western and north-west Czech Republic, for example, the ČHMU website has so far been the fourth highest temperature only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures there started to grow so late this afternoon," the meteorologists reported.
The current winds in the Czech Republic will gradually disappear according to ČHMU and more significant rain may come on Sunday.
Most Moravia sites will remain high temperatures on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia on Saturday.
China lacks tourists.
The Beijing visa policy is costing billions.
China has been trying to apply its influence for decades without using powerful means.
She spends ten billion dollars a year on supporting language schools and building universities abroad, pushing her entertainment industry into foreign markets and trying to attract Western tourists.
But Peking doesn't do that.
The dark state media are talking about a plan to make tourism a driving force for economic change and modernisation.
Last year, however, the number of arrivals rose by only 3.8 per cent and about 80 per cent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macaa and Taiwan.
It is possible, among other things, that, despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners with an open hand, to evaluate the situation in the world's most humane country professor of economics from the Beijing University Christopher Balding in the article for Bloomberg.
An example that speaks for everything is the Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have a visa-free relationship with China, the citizens of those other countries have to deal with the visa with the front.
The Chinese offices in the United States are therefore comparable to the celebrations of the Chinese New Year.
The visa is worth $140, but if you don't want to wait for hours in front, you have to pay $100 and more for additional services.
Such restrictions will create significant economic barriers.
A study in the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for visas reduced the number of visitors in the country concerned by 70 per cent.
In 2015, China visited only two million Americans, while Hong Kong, which shares less than three per cent of China's gross domestic product and lives there less than one per cent of its population, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens this problem itself by using tourism to achieve its political goals, such as in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China in the spring limited transport to South Korea during a break around the South Korean missile system, the South Koreans paid for it and China avoided it.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 per cent annually, while Japan had an 85 per cent increase.
All of this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recent report published by the U.S. Central Bank, China could leave up to $190 billion as a result of foreign travel, while China, in the context of the sale of foreign currency to tourists, will receive about $35 billion annually.
According to official balance of payments figures, China then had a $217 billion deficit in tourism last year, which is equal to 44% of the total Chinese surplus in trade in goods.
A small number of tourists, then, who are anxiously defending the flow of capital, cause a very painful wound.
However, the above factors are only one expression of the general tolerance towards foreigners.
In many places in China, virtually no one has heard about immigrants.
In 2013, less than a million foreigners lived throughout China.
There are more of them in the United States and some individual cities.
Even Japan, which is not exactly the crossroads of immigration, has a double.
A number of scientific work, however, shows that immigrants usually revive economic growth, business and innovation.
However, you will practically not find them in China.
To solve these problems will be politically challenging, but the step offered is to simplify the visa system.
Other Asian countries, particularly India and Vietnam, have recently made a great effort to simplify and reduce visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currency, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the Plenary Zoo, they multiplied deadly poisoned beaches.
The Plzeň Kingdom of Journeys can enjoy the youth of just three rare, mortally eaten beaches.
In the exhibition visitors will see only all nine freshly born Turkish snakes.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, which is also 2,000 metres above sea level.
"It's growing and the length of meters," said the speaker zoo Martin Vobruba.
The young of the other two species, the mortals and the red cobras, will be gathering strength in the backyard.
We still can't tell when people will see them.
"We don't want to lose them," said curator Miroslav Dohnal, saying it could take a year or two.
Australian snakes have come to the world of eight, they are descendants of a breeding couple from a population around Sydney.
"The only one that visitors can see at the exhibition belongs to mortals from around Perth," said Vobruba, saying that in human care there is a need for a more mortal winter of 6-8 weeks at 13 degrees Celsius.
A hundred percent success has led to the snowing of African floating red cobras.
A couple in the Plenary Zoo had a total of four young eggs.
"Incubation lasted 65 days," added Vobrub.
This species in the wild on its victim runs out of poison, which is up to four meters away.
He's looking at the eyes, he can cause permanent blindness.
The young of all three species live in zoo with mice.
Within 40 days in the garden, they still expect the hatching of the young from the dream of a black mom, the eggs are stored in the incubator.
According to an unverified telephone call review, Trump creates pressure on Mexico for payment for the border wall
The U.S. newspaper Washington Post published a copy of President Trump's phone calls with the leading representatives of Mexico and Australia.
In a phone conversation on January 27th with Mexican President Enrique Peño Netam urged her to stop reporting publicly that she would not pay for the construction of the proposed wall.
The U.S. president told him that he was publicly condemning the building of the wall, allegedly saying, "You can't speak in press like this."
Trump, within his campaign, promised to build a wall along the southern border and reported that he would pay Mexico for it.
He also avoided rewriting his first call to the public with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the US surveillance agreement on refugees heading to Australia is "smiley" and "foolish" and insisted that if he agreed with such an agreement - which became President Obama's government - would look like a "drug" after proposing a ban on the entry of refugees into the US.
Trump ended the call after he explained to Turnbull that "this is my most unpleasant call on the day".
Tusk once again told the prosecutor about Smolens.
"There's something to be afraid of," said the President's brother, President of the Government of the Law and Justice of PiS Jaroslaw Kaczyński, at Tusk.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczynski won't scare me," Tusk said and counted on the country's current leadership that he is trying to abuse justice against political opponents.
On his departure from the office, he waited on Tuska on TV 24 dav, who scandalized Donald Tusk! and wanted politics for a hundred years!
Tusk thanked for his support and assured me that he had a clean conscience: "I have nothing to fear, and Kaczynski doesn't scare me."
According to the prosecutors, he doesn't count anything, but he doesn't doubt that justice has to serve the Polish rulers now as a tool against opponents, opposition or people who don't like, and I'm afraid I'm part of this group.
He's been second in the interview.
The expremier was interrogated in the prosecutor's office the second time, this time it was supposed to be a question of doubt in the drinking of victims of the smolten disaster.
In addition, there was a change in the body in cancer.
My family had been banned from opening the cracks, and there must have been some reason for that.
And the reason they were afraid of the scandal was because it would make Polish-Russian relations more difficult.
"Maintaining good relations at any price, despite such dreadful events, should serve to make Donald Tusk very important in the EU," Kaczyński said on Catholic television Trwam.
He added that any conflict with Russia would ruin the chances of gaining the most important seat in the Union, from which Poland has absolutely nothing.
At the same time, Kaczynski announced that he had warned German Chancellor Angel Merkel that Donald Tuske could do it differently, but she didn't realize it.
Tusk filed an eight-hour interrogation at the prosecutor's office on April 19th.
Even then, he did not speak as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many of his summons to the hearing were regarded as part of the obvious effort of the Polish government and chief PiS Kaczyńsk to discredit Tuska as a political rival by connecting with various scandals.
The Prosecutor's Office shall be chaired by the Minister of Justice in Poland, who shall play the role of the Attorney General.
The hearing came after Tusk's election as head of the European Council, which Kaczynski tried to prevent, but tried to prevent, inter alia, Merkel's visit to Warsaw.
At the EU summit against the extension of Tusk's mandate, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlová protested on his own.
In this case, he left Warsaw on the streets and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
Barma and Senegal.
Where can the Czechs go?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to re-vote the composition of a photograph from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections that took place in 2013.
It comes from a statement that regulates the delivery of ballot cards to foreigners.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared its update, currently under review.
Four years ago, MEPs elected 10,000 Czech citizens abroad.
"Since the last update of the 2013 announcement, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists," the ministry reasons its approach.
"In some countries there have been new representative offices, some offices have been closed, some of them have changed the level of representation," the material says.
The notice shall contain two annexes, the first of which shall include the representative offices to which the ballot papers are delivered.
This group includes representatives of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, namely Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a ballot in the print version.
Their list just changed with the release.
Four years ago, Czechs could choose for example at the Czech Embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Today, both embassies are closed.
The Czech Republic also cancelled its representation in the Malaysian Bamak and the Japanese Kyot.
He won't even be elected to the General Consulate in Doneck.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014 due to the war in eastern Ukraine.
They are now on the list of embassies in Kenyan Nairobi, Senegalese capital of Dakar and Zambian Lusace.
In Asia, the Czech Republic has extended its representation on the General Consulate in Irbil and Čecheng, the capital of the Chinese province of S' Čchuan, since the last parliamentary elections.
Voting cards will also be available to registered voters at Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
The Czechs have had the opportunity to elect members in the polls at the representative offices or consulates for the past four times.
Before each election, the State Electoral Commission shall determine the country for which the candidates are voted abroad.
For the first time, it was in 2002 when it was decided between the South Moravian candidates.
In the following two elections, Czechs were elected abroad among South-South candidates.
In 2013, the Mediterranean region was selected as the same year.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is increasing steadily.
At the premiere 15 years ago, about 3,800 people came to vote, in 2006 they were about 6,700, four years later 8222.
To the early elections four years ago, 10,571 were delivered to the embassy.
Massacre on Moore's Ford Bridge: activists recall racist lynching
Ford Mercury, from 1948, traveled around the inhabitants of Monroe, Georgia, and codified to the Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before, however, a car with four passengers of black skin and a white driver had enough to reach the bridge, a group of white men and women with weapons had parked his way.
The group leader - the middle-aged man in the powdered suit - pulled for a long time out of the cigarette and looked at the front glass of the car.
Inside the passengers tremble with fear.
"We want the n--a Roger!" the man shouted.
"Bring it to me!"
Silence interrupts the nest of a young black man who is pulled out of the co-pilot's seat.
Fortunately, this scene is only a reconstruction of the events that took place on July 22nd.
But if one of the men passes through Roger's neck, the crowd will be excited.
From 2005 back to the Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of activists who reconstructed that fate night in 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by the members of the Kukluxklan.
No one's ever been convicted of murder.
"It is strange that not one person has been arrested in all those years - although we still see them in our community; although we know their identity," Tyrone Brooks, who helps to organize the reconstruction of the event, said.
"It is the burden of our history and the burden of our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman from Georgia and a lifelong fighter for civil rights.
In his eyes the reconstruction of the event presents a dramatic challenge to the execution. Each year the city of Monroe recalls that justice has not been done enough.
"We demand judicial complaint and closure, we want peace of mind and peace of mind, but justice above all," Brooks said.
"Until then, the healing and reconciliation process cannot be initiated."
On July 27, 1946, the court doctor covered one of the bodies of the lynching victims at Moore's Ford.
According to the FBI records received by NBC News, the lynching was to be attended by up to 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding periods.
But nobody's been sued yet.
Although the suspects remain at liberty for decades, civil rights supporters claim that both causes of lynching - politics and sex - were known to all citizens of the city.
In April 1946, on the basis of the Supreme Court's decision, the people of the state of Georgia had the first right to participate in the elections scheduled for the summer.
And right during the summer elections, according to the FBI, a black-skin farmer Roger Malcom had to stab the landowners of the white-skin Barnett Hester - allegedly for his wife.
According to Brooks, it was a betrayal that Hester took care of Malcolm Dorothy's wife and brought her to a different state.
According to the FBI statement, on 25 July 1946, the then significant landowner Loy Harrison made bail for Malcolm in the amount of $600.
He was escorted to prison by Dorothy and his cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
When they returned from prison, just before they drove to the Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects took their way.
"As it turned out, the murders were planned and organized by Harrison," the FBI said.
"It is also evident that there has been a secret agreement between state and local law enforcement officers who have not only participated in the lynching but have also taken away the evidence and have concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks made a more brief statement on the whole matter.
"It was a massacre for electoral rights," he said.
"The murders had a clear subtext for all the locals of the black skin: 'this will happen if you register and go to choose'."
The annual reconstruction of the event at Moore's Ford Bridge is organised by Cassandra Greene for nearly ten years.
Its presentation is illustrative, fascinating and exciting. It shows deep-rooted racism, which many would like to see in modern America as extinct.
It's not easy to follow this reconstruction and it's harder to turn the eye away, but Greene says it makes sense.
"No one wants to talk about lynching, because we have to face the unpleasant feelings that are hidden in each of us," Greene said.
"However, there can't be a relationship between us if you don't listen to what I had to go through."
The main tests of this year's reconstruction began in June, and on the very first day, about 30 actors - thousands of whites, the rest of blacks - included in the room where Greene met with a very carefully planned presentation.
Wade Marbough runs the position of assistant director.
For many years he played the leader of Kukluxklan, but according to his words the role is exhausting.
"I feel bad about it because it resists who I am," said Marbough.
"I think it is very important to remember this part of history regularly, because we never want to come back to that time."
The characters Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play the role of Roger Malcolm, the playwright of Barnett Hester, practice their role.
The show starts with a leak - Malcolm deals with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get out of my land--e!"
Rascona can't.
He's coming to the creek.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black-haired actor) will explode in laughter.
Greene laughs most of all.
"What happened?" asks Rascona.
He's confused.
Was I too rough?
"No," Greene said.
"I just don't think the white people at the time said 'n--r' in such a tone."
"Precisely," one of the black-haired actors will throw.
"You have to put more emphasis on R."
Energy in the room is suddenly better; hostility replaces a sense of closeness.
Everyone wants the presentation to be authentic, just to be done for four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
Rascona this time emphasizes the correct expression of the word at N.
No one's laughing anymore.
The show ends violently and quickly.
Reve, shot... and quiet.
A woman dressed in black stands above the bodies of the actors and sings a sad song by Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit.
With every word there's a feeling of sadness in the room.
At the back of all this, about a dozen viewers are tearing the pot and tears out of their eyes.
There are practically the same number of blacks and whites in the neighborhood.
One couple traveled all the way from New York to Ithaca, a lot of people looking around.
Each of them wears local humidity for almost eight hours and Brooks leads them to Malcolm and Dorsey's graves.
Until now, the killings could have been looked at with a retreat, but now, standing at the same place where lynching came, the atmosphere is terrifying.
With the last words, he will call Greene's dav looking at the inspection of the bodies.
The children kneel to the victims' heads, they follow false blood and unmoved bodies, and they whisper something in their ears.
"They're not dead," will the little boy.
He'll run for a few minutes and Greene will thank you for that.
The actors are cleaning up the wool and tearing out their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbough, the man in the suit who played the leader of the Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascona hugs his two friends-heroes and cries in their arms; finally, they're left with emotions.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know that your role lies.
But you had a reason for that."
Later on the same day, the audience will be sitting together with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple are busy talking to the black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski barely found words that would express her feelings from today's performance.
"It is difficult to listen to those ugly words and look at the horrible things... that people do who look like you and do it because they look like you," she said to the reconstruction.
"It makes me realize that lynching is still the current theme," she added, "just called police leaks".
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks sits in the courthouse, enjoying dinner and talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he's already planning a show for another year.
"The reconstruction of these events is inspiring, as it describes the fear we had to experience - but it is also a moment of thought," he said.
“If we don’t learn from this, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and study the history of their country are doomed to repeat it."
I love instructions for use.
One of my friends says the instructions to use are just reading the rhymes.
I don't agree, on the contrary.
It's one of the modern forms of art, often surrealism.
With nostalgia I remember a long time ago, where the instruction to use anything was rather a rarity order.
So maybe my first gramophone contained only one paper, on which were hieroglyphics showing the involvement of some parts, there were some secret marks in all of them.
When something went wrong with me after years, I offered the sheet to shaman who was not afraid to unscrew the backboard.
He gave me a piece of advice on what that labyrinth paper is good for.
Yes, it was a regular aid for chronic decommissioning of toilet paper.
He found a thread that was broken and allowed me to listen again to the expensive vinyl plates.
The new era has brought new guidance.
Even a relatively simple fruit-repairer, where the overcrowded grep just held, demanded about ten images.
Especially mentioned was a description of how to insert one part into another.
The combination was ambiguous and another procedure was simply not possible.
On the contrary, it required considerable effort with the need to break certain plastic components.
My contempt for guidance ended with my self-movement of the Seal Leon.
The year 2003 was still the year of production of such a booklet with detailed corrections including, inter alia, the exchange of flashlight lamps.
It was simple.
A total of three steps and the work should be done.
Regrettably, the author of the guide pointed out that while the lighthouse was on the right, it changed really only in three steps.
1st cover.
2. Unscrew a broken lamp and rescrew a new one.
3rd cover.
The flashlight on the left had a problem as the battery cover was located.
At first I thought that I would insert the right upper ends into the car compartments of a handrail, a screw to which it would easily cover the retreat and then drive points 1-3 of the savings author of the service book.
I'm afraid it's a raccoon.
The cover had no place, no space, no space for the hand of the Aspelčina, but the giant Slezan.
I've lost half an hour of my life, and it's completely without any success.
The situation was further strengthened by my wife's entrance to the garage, which she called a river and a word that from my mouth sounds quite exceptional.
"What are you doing here?" she asked.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, but if I miss the vulgar terms, there were only two publishing words left.
I'm changing the light bulb.
"And why does it take you so long?" she ventured a wind that could be her last in a long-lasting relationship.
I explained to her the problem slowly, with the main emphasis on the torture of the author of the instruction, where the burning iron on the hand that the instruction was written, after her essay so that she could never write anything again, was a mere introduction to the wide scale of Kladiv's instructions to the witch, including his commissional fire on the top of the Losin Castle.
"What's going on with that box?" the woman passed out of the battery.
In a clear hope, this happened and then step 1-3 was as easy and fast as the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
And that's until the day my colleague called me, who was just talking about collapsing state after checking two State Drug Control Officers.
I know her as a well-balanced colleague who has experienced possible and impossible in the field and who can also explain wild stories with unrestrained voices.
"You imagine that I've been punished for not hanging a hand-washed manual," he told me in a weak voice.
Gradually, I solved the whole problem, which was that the patient's toilet washroom has no image instruction to wash his hands.
His argument to the commission officer that adults wash their hands normally is that there is no need for pictograms to overcome the usual activity of the right people, has no beneficial effect and has cost him a lot of money.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He understood that the simple swelling of the drained hand flowing water is a primitive task at the level of the crown, that a modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performs this ceremony in ten steps.
So it's necessary to tell you that it's necessary to get out of a bucket of water.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but finally it's a joy to find out that a man washed his hands exactly as he orders a chump from Süklu.
Finally, I have to point out that I have been inspired and am preparing a detailed plan of action on the toilet.
In the case of defection, the procedure is uniform, there will be no problem, in the case of urine, given the difference between the two sexes, it will be necessary to hang the instructions two.
The problem remains those pictograms, because creating a perfect procedure means also the exact description of all anatomical details, which could give rise to a certain exodus at a prudent visitor's toilet, the argument that one can finally find out that for the rest of his life the proper opening was entirely wrong.
Pearson will release another 3000 employees and reduce dividends in an effort to revive the trade
The British Education Group Pearson said on Friday that it would release another 3,000 employees and reduce the temporary dividend by 72 per cent in response to another restructuring programme to change the business model.
A further wave of release, which, according to Executive Director John Fallon, will come at the end of 2018 and from the beginning of 2019, follows the previous decision of the company to release 4,000 employees in the framework of the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a cost reduction plan of another $300 million ($394 million) in May under the Third Programme to reduce costs in an effort to create a declining trade as a result of the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its share in the Penguin Random House of Bertelsmann, stated that the outlook for this year's year remained unchanged after it announced a one-percent increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on the convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers were killed in a suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan in Kabul. During the attack, one NATO soldier died and several others were injured, officials said.
Five soldiers and interpreters were injured, as stated in NATO statement.
According to informal reports, three civilians died during the attack in Qarabagh's urban period.
This month, Afghanistan hit a bomb attack - more than 30 people were killed on Tuesday when the war broke out in the heroic mix.
On Monday, the suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO stated in its statement that an emergency explosion occurred after the guard was attacked by members of the Afghan army “a local person with a sub-manufactured explosive device”.
The statement further states that all wounded soldiers are at risk of life and are at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airport.
According to the rapporteurs, the increasing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh area is a major source of concern for NATO's allies in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% died in the capital.
At the end of July, at least 30 people died in a car bomb in the Kabul district of Shia.
The Taliban has joined the attack.
On 31 May, a large explosion in the city centre killed more than 150 people. It is the most deadly militant attack in the country since the US troops launched the Taliban government in 2001.
Violence is undermining such a dubious situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering an increase in the number of American soldiers who should help military units and police officers in the country.
According to the rapporteurs, the suicide attacks to which the public's confidence in the government, its regulation, and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghann, have been disrupted in recent weeks.
The EPA, in its response to the complaint, reassessed its decision to derogate from the smoking rules
The US Environmental Protection Agency withdrew its decision to postpone the Obama Administration Act, which ordered the states to reduce emissions, only the day after the Agency had appealed to the 15 States.
In the middle of the night, the EPA announced its decision to implement the "Ozone Standards 2015" in its statement that it is submitting the Agency's commitment to cooperate with the States.
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and listen to their opinions," said EPA Director Scott Pruitt.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA's attempt to remove ozone standards - which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and, on the basis of the measurement, define the limits to be met by October 2018.
A group of fifteen of the majority of the democratic states, together with Washington, D.C., filed a complaint Tuesday arguing that the EPA negotiations are illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump is trying to prevent many environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - according to Trump's words in an effort to boost economic growth.
However, the new government's efforts have started countermeasures by democrats and conservative groups who fear the impact of emissions on public health.
On its website, the EPA states that breathing air with ozone content "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms", such as asthma.
The singer Ladislav Bubnár was wounded and blood flowed!
This, in our relatively new singer, you may have already registered in June of this year, when this almost unknown singer in our midst organized on the Czech atmosphere a monster event, hosted by such leading personalities as the master Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krain and a number of others, and the event was not observed by anyone other than Leoš Mareš.
The purpose was simple, public display and presentation of his music video to the song of Sarah, whose baptism was lacking in the newly named personalities.
But hardly anyone knows that the filming of the video that took place in Russia did not take place without problems and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first big movie with Russian national ballet stars and it didn't happen without a proper trap.
Sara's song is very emotional and is based on the unfortunate love of two lovers.
For the dramaticness of the scene, the video clip of the singers’ juice should indicate the impact of the facade.
At one point, however, he struck him so strongly and directly into the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was the morning, I didn't expect it, it immediately came down from my nose," Ladislav noted the situation.
The situation was said by colleagues and producers on the spot that it was an unfortunate accident and Ladislav was unable to react in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not so serious as to influence the continuation of another film.
The above video from the young artist we are bringing you now, you can also record the scene with the hit.
Unsanctioned version of blood, however, was not better used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomačenko spoke at a meeting about the possibilities of mutual duel
Vasyl Lomačenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most intense boxing game in a lightweight, met for the first time at a Tuesday meeting.
Each of them was located in a separate room in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, while Garcia - the unbeatable champion in the World Boxing Council - did not go down to the hall where he welcomed Lomačenka, the champion in the World Boxing Organization.
After Garcia's victory on the basis of a unanimous decision against the former four-time World Champion Adrian Broner in the Saturday game at Showtime, both boxers got on the list of the five best boxers in a lightweight carriage.
Garcia drew up his right hand and said: “How are you, champ?
Good luck."
She defends her title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN on Saturday at 19:00.
The boxers look forward to photographers and the manager of the Egis Klimis Lomačenko adds that the potential fight of the boxers would be a "perfect test".
"I'm a former champion in a feather carriage," says Garcia.
“Because of the Broner match (67 kg) I had to bring it up, but I'm not that big.
I'm a kid at my 63 kg.
I'd like to go back to the lightweight category.
The cracker has to get back together to get on a light weight... and then we can fight.
That's what the fans want.
Why don't you fill it out for them."
The breaker agrees.
"The box would benefit this game."
The climate has raised a demand for payment for sightseeing - which is part of its strategy. Colleagues should graduate their debut in a lightweight vase at the end of this year and next year compete with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also expressed an interest in the game against the winner of the duel Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who competed on 23 September on the title in a lightweight vase in the Forum arena.
"The game should run in the style of payment for watching, the fans are asking," said Garcia, who later said that the opportunity to broadcast the game was open through a television station that comes with the best offer.
“We are the main attraction.
No one else will draw such attention to himself.
We'll wait for the right opportunity..."
Garcia said that he recognized Lomachena as a "wonderful boxer" and could participate in his Saturday match.
But he didn't give Garcia the praise when he said that the three-division champion from Riverside looks "very slow... sorry to Mike, but you're talking about knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show the strength and until then the box.
Both boxers said they felt the tension rising before each other's duel.
“You will not forget this game.
There's no other game that pays so much attention to itself.
And with great comfort, I'll put it in the fire," said Garcia.
"I've been waiting for the best boxers, and this is Mikey."
It's gonna be a great game."
A young couple of years ago disappeared without a trace.
Their cars have now been found at the bottom of Volha.
Two young Russians Ilja Žirnov and Kira Čerkasov have been missing since December 2005.
There was a great search for them, but no success.
And the police finally ended the investigation for lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in uncertainty that they wouldn't know what happened.
After 12 years, the sad end of the whole story came.
The train found a laity submarine at the bottom of the Volha River in the city of Čeboksary in Chuvašk.
Only through the documents left in the car did the police manage to identify a few.
The documents survived the entire decade under the water, without which it would take a long time for the police to find the identity of the found.
A couple were last seen when Žirnov borrowed a car from his father so he could pick up his girlfriend from work.
The smoker who discovered the car is still anonymous.
He reported his findings to the Cheboxian police who pulled the car onto the beach the next day.
Investigators believe that the death of a young couple was an accident that led to the smooth road leading along the river.
However, further details will be published upon completion of the investigation.
Latest results of tests to establish the age limit for asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of the refugee trials on asylum in Sweden, which have been detailed in their new age method, show that over 80 percent of people were questioned as older than 18 years, but not every person believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started its new tests at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is a more accurate assessment of applicants in the framework of the assessment of asylum applications. The measure was adopted after the Swedish Migrationsverket was criticised for failing to determine the correct age of some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted 6880 cases for investigation and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published a total of 2481 tests carried out from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80 per cent (2002) was considered to be 18 years of age, while in another 25 cases, the Forensic Medical Agency decided that the question was "maybe 18 years of age".
In another 423 cases it was decided that the question was "maybe younger than 18 years".
Tests shall only be accessed if the age of the contested dispute is at issue.
According to Johan Góransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
"In contrast to last month, the statistics are held in occupied colleges and the numbers are very similar," The Local said.
A higher number of applicants whose age was estimated to be 18 years old does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers lie about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and stated that in 442 cases it was found that "the person interviewed is 18 years of age or older".
The Svenska Dagbladet newspaper investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases it was indicated that it would be 18 years of age.
Critics also found a medical method to determine age, which includes X-rays of the teeth of wisdom and MRI scans of knee joints, which are then examined by dentists and X-rays.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who, among other things, deals with assessing the biological maturity of people to determine the age of puberty.
“I had reason to think about this issue and I do not think that these types of measurements to assess age are correct.
The assessment of biological age is, in a sense, very uncertain.
If we can't determine the age with precision, we shouldn't pretend the same," he said for Metro.
The Forensic Medical Agency's Göransson defended the decision to say: "In general, the risk of miscarriage of the child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the person in question is under 18 years of age, which corresponds in this case to 10 per cent of all those in question."
Trump was threatening Mexico's president on the phone.
American President Donald Trump in the January phone call to Mexican President Enrique Peñon Niet threatened not to meet him if he would publicly say that his country would not pay for the construction of a wall between the US and Mexico.
Trump said in the interview that financing would somehow be arranged, even though he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Similarly, Trump also spoke openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
It comes from the reviews of the interviews published on Thursday by the American newspaper The Washington Post.
Trump made the construction of a wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his last election campaign.
In the first conversation with the Mexican president shortly after entering the function of Trump Peña Nieta, he was not diplomatically driving because he was critical of his plan to build the wall.
The southern neighbour was cured as a growing political problem and pressuring the Mexican president not to publicly say his government will never pay for the wall.
"You can't say this press," said Trump repeatedly in the January 27th interview and threatened to interrupt contact with the Mexican president if he continues to issue a repulsive statement.
The financing is going to come up somehow, and it's going to work out.
"But if you're going to say that Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to contact you gentlemen anymore, because it's unacceptable for me," said the American newspaper Trump.
Now he has identified the least important thing we're talking about, but politics may be the most important thing.
The executive order to build the wall Trump issued shortly after the takeover of power.
Mexico rejects construction and financing of a wall of 2,200 kilometres long, and both countries have also lost their relations.
At the end of March, Trump said the project would be paid by the United States.
Trump finally met with his Mexican opponent for the first time at the July G20 Summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump's telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28.
The Chief of the White House's conversation was called a joke.
To this end, it was adopted by an exchange of views on an agreement whereby Australia would provide asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for United States acceptance of persons from international facilities in the Pacific States.
Trump first thought the deal was stupid, but later he joined her.
"You can certainly say that this is not the agreement you have made, but you will have to stick to it," said Trump Turnbull.
In some passages, telephone conversations with Turnbull were almost animalistic, for example when Trump considered it a good idea to accept Australian refusal to accept refugees sailing in ships.
"You're worse than me," he joked to Trump.
Suddenly, however, the tone of the conversation went out.
"I hate the acceptance of these people," Trump noted.
I assure you they're wrong.
That's why they're in prison now.
"There will be no great people going to work for local milkers," he said.
He also noted in the discussion that in five years the fugitive could become a Bostonan assassin.
Trump led by the end of January, about a week after coming to the White House, telephone conversations with a number of world statesmen, often even during one day.
The call with Turnbull finally marked the least pleasant one for the whole day.
Before he finished, he pointed out that he had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin before.
They've fixed the man who killed Rani in front of the dam.
He looked at her father, too.
Correction took place at the square in the capital of Yemen Saná.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose the little Ran Almatari who lived in his neighborhood for his sacrifice.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took her father to the house where he raped her and stabbed her with his bare hands.
Then he raped her and her body, which then hit close to the mixture.
The violent death of a little girl struck the whole country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the first row of a thousand-thousand dab that met to be a witness to the reform.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi was sentenced to a charge of sedition.
The victim's father shared his feelings with the media after the repairs.
I feel like I'm reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's the new day of my life.
The other members of the family were present, along with the dove, shouting the password "let justice live".
The attacker on the scene brought the police delivery he was pulled from.
The cops put him on the stomach.
One of his supporters turned his weapon against him and fired a fire out of the immediate vicinity.
The present dove celebrated every morning that was burned.
Mr. al Almatari told the MailOnline website that justice was done in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah and the right of the Shariah prevailed," he added.
I was standing at the Center of Liberation in Sana and waiting for my daughter's killer to be repaired.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Ranina's small body and buried it in a nearby graveyard.
Me and my wife Jamileh are grateful that justice has been done.
The police were afraid that the crowd gathered on the scene would fall into hateless madness, the murderer would fall and commit adultery.
Correction was ordered by a court under the administration of the Shiite Huts.
Initially, though, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 wounds immediately after his arrest, but his act sparked such a rebellion that the judge decided to punish him.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl disappeared on June 27th.
Her family knew him well.
When the police searched his house's store, they found evidence that the man was planning his actions.
Mr. Almatari described him as a creature.
What could have been his motive?
Even animals would be more kind to the Brah.
"Our family has no enemies, and the injury that took Ranina's body was terrible," the media said.
"The morning disappeared in the afternoon, we announced it to the police that day, we told the newspapers and all our television stations, posters with her photo hung everywhere," he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a tip from killer parents who suspected their son of a terrible crime.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after learning that her daughter's body was found.
She used to play out with the other kids in the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went to see where he was.
We were looking everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took our cars and drove around, but we were looking for nothing.
The inhabitants of Yemen were abused by the crime and began to gather in front of the police station where al Maghrabi was held and to demand immediate punishment.
The representative of the Ministry of Justice read the present file of investigation to calm them down.
The accused did not manifest pity for everything he had done.
Just prior to the execution of the sentence, the police read his sentence, but the convicted man only looked at his rector.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but a lot of records appeared on the Internet, which he ordered.
The Governor of West Virginia announced the change of the political party
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday evening at the meeting of President Trump that he is moving to another side.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me," said the Governor of Justice.
"Today, after a long prayer and meditation, I announce to you... today, as a resident of West Virginia, I say that I can no longer support you from the position of democratic governor."
The audience was delighted.
"I will join the Republicans tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a coach, I can tell you it's time to jump into another game."
Trump had already promised people an important announcement at a meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia and Justice did not support the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large estate from his father and owns several coals.
The value of his assets is estimated at $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night saying: "The overrun of the Governor of Justice is another morning for the democratic party that puts us in the way, instead of helping to lift our country."
"For a democratic party that has only 15 governors and has at least the legislative authorities in history, the announcement by the Governor of Justice is the last step for the already so-retired party without a leader who is desperately trying to find a positive and unified message," RNC President Ronna McDaniel stated in his statement to the CBS News.
Sebastian Coe commends the "true" apology Russia for the doping scandal
Former outstanding sportsman Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for an honest apology for the doping scandal, but repeated that so far the time has not come for Russia to return to the sports world.
The head of the Russian athlete Dmitry Shylakhtin said on the occasion of the IAAF Congress - which took place on the night before MS in the sport - that his country's exile from the sports world was right and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all athletes who thus lost gold and silver medals.”
Despite his comments, the members of the IAAF Congress voted to retain the ban that entered into force in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) reported that Russia supported the doping of its athletes.
"I think we have witnessed very honest responses and presentations today," IAAF President Sebastian Coe told reporters.
"All the members of the Council and Congress were delighted to see Russia admit its error and work with all the strengths to repair and restore the proper function of the whole federation."
Coe said he was also "satisfied", that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think that today has been very successful and we have gone to another level, but Congress supports the recommendation of the crisis staff to maintain the sentence that has been imposed on Russia," Coe added.
"In the coming months, we have to do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
Our effort has always been to separate honest athletes from those who are disrespectful," he ended his speech.
At MS in the sport that starts on Friday in London, under neutral flag, 19 Russian athletes who have complied with the strict rules of the IAAF will compete.
The crisis chief of the IAAF Rune Andersen said Monday that Russia still needs to meet several criteria before it is allowed back.
The drug presence tests are still unsatisfactory and the exclusion of coaches continues to operate, he told reporters in London after the presentation of the IAAF Council.
CzechTrade received Františka Savova's state contract.
The Czech Trade State Pro-Export Agency received a public order from Mladá fronta Františka Savova.
Officials have awarded him 100 percent points in all quality criteria.
They did not mind, however, that the Czech state complains to Savov about tax fraud and asks for his release to the Czech Republic.
The pro-export agency of the Czech Trade Ministry of Industry and Commerce issued a public contract in April to provide editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal for four years.
A total of 30.8 million crowns were awarded to the publisher of the Young Front by Františk Savova.
However, the Czech police have already accused him of tax evasion in 2014.
Savov fled to Great Britain, and the Czech Republic is asking for his release.
For the case, the server alerted Aktuálná.cz.
The award of the contract was subject to the original CzechTrade criteria to decide by 60 per cent the price offered and by the remaining 40 beauty competitions, i.e. the quality of the project.
Yet, it was the second criterion that helped Sav’s company.
According to the information, Dotyk.cz received 100 points in all partial quality criteria.
As a result, it was moved before another candidate, the publisher of Vltava Labe Media VLM, who at the time offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated with 404 900 crowns per month, VLM offered 324 350 crowns.
Unlike the young front, however, the score was based on an average rating of 62 points in all qualitative criteria.
The trend was further attended by the consulting company BDO Advisors and the digital agency R-Media, which is also part of the server Aktuálně.cz under the publication Economy.
VLM published several objections against the outcome of the tender, considering its assessment to be unfair and insufficiently justified.
Following their refusal, it was decided to enter into competition with the Office for the Protection of the Competition of the UOHS.
It is believed that the Czech Trade has acted in breach of the law.
"The proposer is convinced that the tenderer has reached the decision to select the contracting entity on the basis of a series of subjective evaluations, a clearly favourable participant of the Young Front, a.s., on behalf of the proposer and other suppliers," is written in the proposal to initiate the procedure submitted to the ÚOHS this week, which has been published by the server Currently.
According to the Director-General and the Chairman of the VLM Michael Klima Representation, the pointing of the selection committee appears as an incredible and centennial evaluation of the Youth Front project in all its members as an extraordinary suspect.
"Every independent observer must consider such a miraculous success as one of the competitors is unlikely and suspicious," said the Current Climate.
The Czech Trade has not yet expressed itself in the situation.
The Czech Trade Agency is basically not commenting on public contracts before their closure.
All information about you are published in the Customer's Profile and in the Public Procurement Journal in accordance with the Act.
"After the end of the contract, a complete written report will be published, but during the duration of the contract we cannot express ourselves during the contract," said Dotyk.cz media representative of the agency Štěpán Dlohý.
The young front responded by saying that it considered it extremely problematic that the Economie publisher had been affected by the article in Aktuálná.cz in a competition where it had its own business interests.
However, this fact was mentioned in the above Article.
In the tender, she could have been helped to provide the BusinessInfo editorial service portal in the previous four years.
The contract was first awarded in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade led by Martim Cuba ODS.
Františka Savova blames the police for tax evasion in connection with his company's excessive VAT deductions, which caused the Czech state to claim damages of up to 770 million crowns.
The Czech Republic has been asking the United Kingdom to issue it since 2014.
According to Savov, he is responsible for his criminalization by ANO Andrej Babiš, under whose influence the Mafra publishing works.
The London court of last year rejected Savov's appeal against the issue, but the businessman refused.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since last year, we have not yet received any understanding of the legal power of judgment from the United Kingdom," said Štěpánka Zenklová, a spokesman for the Prague City State Office.
In addition to the property of the Mladé front, Savov was represented in the company Harvey Limited with a seat in Cyprus, which was owned by the Czech Buddhist beermaker Samson, and in the Cypriot company Maraflex, which is profiled as an investment fund that buys dangerous assets.
It should also be controlled by the corrupt Heavy Machinery Services company, before Legios, which owes more than three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the extraction of property from a former Socialist Youth Union.
The motorbike drove around the hall and the park, ended up in the quay.
The motorist directed attention to himself by an impartial ride across the streets, walkways and park roads in Úšovići.
When the surveillance began to pursue him, he decided to take her in the direction of the position.
"Polices of men with increased caution followed by the city when on one of the side roads behind the Mariana Lazny failed to manage and drove with a motorcycle to the field where he was crashing," said police spokesman Daniel Dvořák.
Finally, he had to fly to a rescue helicopter that transported an injured motorist to a pulmonary hospital.
The police subsequently found that the motorist had a wrong driving licence, the registration marks on the motorcycle had been cut off, his production number had been discarded and his own production tag had been removed.
It's possible that the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is subject to further investigation.
"A breath test was conducted to exclude the presence of alcohol in the driver, but a positive result of methamphetamine was found," the police spokesperson added.
How the financial rules of football will affect Neymara's move to Paris
The rules restricting the financing of European football clubs do not in any way disrupt Neymar's record transition from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any criminalisation for Paris Saint-Germain will be carried out by EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to prevent teams from taking part in the prestigious League of Masters.
The financial fair play rules (FFP) introduced by UEFA in 2011 provide that the PSG will have to prove that Neymar's infringement has not been financed without significant losses.
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million in recosting only to buy Neymar out of his contract and Neymar will demand a payment of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
It follows several financial conditions of Neymar's transition to France.
Given that the PSG team is funded by a rich cat family that has enriched its energy sales, Neymara can afford to bring into such a star football family.
Clubs may lose huge amounts for the purchase of players, but on the other hand they have to prove legal sources of revenue, which allows them to cover the direct costs of trading activities related to football.
FFP introduced Michel Platini after reaching the seat of UEFA Director in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that were owed in pursuit of new powers ultimately cheated and risked bankruptcy if banks or owners refused to provide.
In 2011, the FFP's rules shifted its attention from club debt to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovic with Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and losing mountain amounts for players y to build a global brand - all of a sudden it wasn't so beneficial.
During the current three-year trial period ending in 2018, clubs may lose up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini had to leave his post in 2015, his successor Aleksander Čeferin is determined to defend the prohibition of excessive loss.
"The FFP rules are still valid and we decide to strengthen them in the future," said Associated Press Andrea Traverso, who monitors compliance with the FFP rules last week.
Although the PSG has paid the amount for the purchase of Neymara in a one-off payment, it may spread the amount for the purposes of accounting for the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be credited to EUR 44,4 million each year for a five-year period.
The first wave of the FFP's highest sanctions was in 2014 with Manchester City, which owns the Abu Dhabi group.
The PSG suffered a fine of EUR 60 million (US$ 82 million) - which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and an order to reduce the team of the League of Champions to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA shall pay attention to teams that may attempt to raise their revenues by means of companies associated with the owners of clubs.
Therefore, even if the Catalyst sponsors PSG as soon as the financing exceeds the value of the standard market rate, UEFA shall be entitled to prohibit the calculation of the amount.
UEFA joined in 2014 after deciding that the amount of funding provided by Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
The share of Neymar revenue in the PSG could, according to some reports, be replaced by the Organisational Commission of MS in the 2022 football field in Qatar.
However, PSG and representatives of MS 2022 in Qatar denied the fact that Neymat should become an MS ambassador in football and that such a maneuver would easily be discovered by UEFY.
The previous sanctions imposed on the PSG mean that UEFA will carefully monitor any attempt to comply with the rules,
According to the UEFA's Tuesday statement, no investigation was initiated in the case of a violation of Neymara to the PSG.
The source of this report wanted to remain anonymous, since it is not allowed to comment on the situation with PSG, the Associated Press said.
The latest published accounts show that PSG closed 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been published.
The PSG expects the arrival of Neymara to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and selling clothes.
The contract firm promises to increase the turnover by up to 30 per cent.
The representatives of the Spanish League, apparently concerned with the departure of one of the largest stars, sought to stifle Neymar's departure, arguing that the PSG violates the FFP rules.
"It's a clear case of a ‘financial doping’ club and the state," president La Ligy Javier Teba said for the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the property of the PSG club as a cat union.
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger, whose club owns an American sports magnet, shares the same position as La Ligy on the financing of the club.
"It is the result of ownership that has changed the football world over the past 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
“As soon as it becomes the owner of the club, everything is possible.
Compliance with the financial fair play rules is very difficult because the state may have different interests in the participation of such players in its club."
Sparttánský Росски: Changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand applauding fans on their feet.
Tomáš Russky is going to the square.
Same scene as in a Sunday fight against the Bohemians.
The partisan treasurer turned against the Red Star game, invented several goals, but his teammates did not die in black.
The flight team, fuelled by new multi-millionaire forces, ends after the initial double match in the European cupboards.
Was it hard to do anything else with the fight after the birth of Belgrade?
After the raid, we had to shoot four, which was hard for us.
At least we wanted not to lose, to raise our minds so that we could get back from what we had to do with other games.
We had a chance.
We need to work together as a team and move our game.
Why couldn't Sparta get into the fight so long?
The game is terribly developed.
The match combination was much better than ours.
We didn't get to anything, we shot once in a while.
Of course, it's very little if you have to win two or three goals.
The second half was much better, we managed to play with them in the final third.
But you have to push your opponent more often into such positions.
Is there a problem with a large number of changes in the composition?
Of course, it's one of the pain when a new team is formed.
We only played three competitions and the composition is still changing.
It's about the coach finding the perfect eleven that's sitting.
Is it encouraging to you that you've already played part of two games after you?
They're still just part of the fight.
I don't know how my condition will develop and if I can finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have occurred in Sparta?
We have to be, otherwise it's not.
It's the same as injury.
If you don't believe it, you can't come back.
Sparta decided somehow, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
The fans came again in great numbers, but they left in despair.
What can you tell them?
There was a wonderful visit again, just like with Godman.
I'm so sorry we can't make them happy with better performance.
Imagine something they'll come for next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember such visits when I played here 15 years ago.
Can the season be at least an advantage for the league?
So far we've been fighting each other, we're fighting, so it's not such an advantage for us.
After the extreme tax evasion, the businessman has to stay for ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of the company Jiří Toman, who has to stay in prison for a considerable tax reduction of ten years.
The estimated damage is 645 million crowns.
Toman complained that justice had violated his fundamental rights, that the actual findings of the courts in Zlina and Olomouci are perhaps incomplete.
However, the Constitutional Courts identified the complaint as unfounded and found the PRC from the Court’s database.
The U.S. is not another appeal court.
"It shall not be possible, as a fourth instance, to assess the actual or legal doubts alleged by the General Court, if they do not represent violations of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," it is stated in the resolution.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been valid since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Olomouci.
At that time, Toman was in a publishing prison in Argentina, where he was also in the time of the U.S. decision.
The penalty imposed is legal rates at the upper limit, which according to the verdict corresponds to the damage caused.
The Supreme Court has identified the case as an extreme tax evasion, which has up to macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
The man acted as the president of the World Services delegation from 2005 to 2008.
The damage of 645 million crowns arose only from January to July 2008, a total escape according to the expert exceeded the billion.
However, for procedural reasons it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the full amount.
According to the complaint, World Service did not include in its tax acknowledgement all invoices.
Instead of monthly VAT and consumer taxes, at least ten million crowns have paid taxes in only statisins.
World Servis and some companies with whom the company was trading have a relationship with Radomíra Vírālar, a company that has been measured by justice for VAT machines in trades with moving substances for 13 years in prison.
His complaint was also rejected before the Constitutional Court.
The series "Summer for Survival" and "Comrade Detective" play on the nostalgic string
This iteration of the story is nostalgic both for the characters of the famous 80s; for the dirty 90s (when the genius David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced the MTV comedy sketch "The State"); and, of course, also for modern times, especially the year 2001 than the stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd argued about larger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and at the same time the embodiment of our modern facebook era of lasting memories.
From a French point of view, it looks like someone's breathing.
The "First Day of Camp" series worked surprisingly well - not only because of absurd humor (for example, the story of the creation of a talking backpack with the vegetables that H. Jon Benjamin made).
The authors turned away from the main funny point - middle-aged actors who play teenage children - and could not hide from previous events.
The continuation of "Ten Years Later", in which adults play not so much on emotional level and satire is places to sporadic, including a 90-year-old triller parody as "Hand on the cobble."
At one point the building will find Apple Powerbook, Wheelchairs and "many other things from 1991".
Many main history lines are repeated.
The good-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, has not yet moved through his love to Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still panicking.
Not to mention the crazy complex involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Shawlter), which is inspired by George H. W. Bush (very well-contained Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of French is many side stories.
It is especially fun to watch forever young Rudd with long hair aliases made by Matt Dillon from the film Youth, whose once respectful character Andy is now behind the old paprika.
Frenchman could start the moments of random madness, as if he would return to the Seven Up series, until he achieves what I suppose would be a logical explanation: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", when the entire group last stage is released at the premiere of the "Flight to Survival".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon calls for another type of nostalgia: Revivalism of the Cold War series "Such Normal American", the movie "Atomic Blonde: No pity" and even the series "GLOW", in which the icons of the Eastern and Western Wrestling scene meet.
The comedy of the creators Brian Gatewood and Alessandra Tanaka in Rhyse Thomase is supposed to act as a television scene: a drama about two Bucharest policemen from Romania in the 1980s who fought for truth and atheism in the way of Marxism-Leninism.
The main role - the wooded Gregor and the idealist Joseph - is to play Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelius Street, which were built into the English language Channing Tatum (executive serial producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a wonderful idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more.
Some jokes make you laugh (such as policemen watching chess on TV - parody on American football).
The series borrowed its voice from many famous actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny.
But "Comrade Detective" focuses too much on an unscrupulous propaganda drama - which includes a killer with the Reagan mask - and it also looks like it.
Six long episodes are too loose and comedy moments aren't enough.
With a shorter trail, the propaganda satire in the "Comrade Detective" could work, such as in a scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the United States Embassy, in which the two fats inhale the hamburgers assembled on a large crowd.
A clear message for the imaginary communist community is the fact that Western culture can turn everything into a cage and an orgy.
The ideas of Romanian creators were not wrong: we do so with our own culture, as well as with theirs.
The Russian athletes didn't expect to cancel the IAAF startup ban.
The International Athlete Federation of IAAF at the London Congress confirmed the extension of the international ban on the launch of Russian racers due to the state supported by the doping programme.
The vote at the World Championship event, which began on Friday, was expected to take place very unanimously.
For the extension of the ban, there were 166 delegates against only 21 votes.
The main reason for the refusal is the fact that Russia is unable to meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as the IAAF Rune Andersen, the head of the special investigation group, noted before the Congress.
His group recommended that the ban continue.
Some older doping cases remain unresolved, a number of suspected athletes have not yet been heard, and coaches still work in the country with a shameful reputation.
The Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, which does not meet the standards of the World anti-doping agency, has not yet been fully functional.
However, RUSada can already conduct testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
"Even though progress has been made, much more work is still needed," said IAAF President Sebastian Coe.
The Russian athletic federation was suspended in November 2015, so Russian athletes lost last year's Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban on incoming MS, 19 Russians who had shown earlier that they had been tested outside the Russian anti-doping system for a longer time.
But they won't be able to start at the championship in national colors and in case of victory they won't win the Russian gym.
The Bank of England will maintain a interest rate of 0,25 %
The Bank of England should be expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged following the negligible economic growth and the weakening of inflation that has led to speculation about rapid growth.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain "in the background" in relation to the maintenance of the interest rate - despite the demands of family budgets.
The policy makers of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of England voted six times to maintain a rate of 0.25%. The results of the vote to increase the rate have supported a significant economic growth supported by weak growth.
In its annual inflation report, the Bank predicted growth of 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the reduction in family budgets would continue.
At the same time, the Bank indicated that over the next few years there should be growth as a result of the inflation caused by Brexit and also indicated that rent from mobility should increase in financial markets more than expected.
The members of the Committee also voted in favour of downloading part of the mammary package, which was intended to support the economy, which was put into practice a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, from the next February, it should start to pay the plan for future financing, which will offer a cheap subsidy to banks, although the Bank of England has indicated that, contrary to the planned $115 billion, it will now offer a budget of £15 billion less.
Just before the bank’s decision, it stated: “MPC predicts that the gross domestic product (GDP) will, in the short term, be stagnant together with the pressure on real household income and the burden of consumption.”
On the subject of the rate, the bank stated that it would be necessary to "remove the remaining monetary policies" to calm inflation, which is "to a greater extent" than the markets expect.
Markets currently predict first growth in the third quarter of next year and further growth in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be "allowable" and "limited".
The Bank has reduced the forecast of growth for the year and the following year compared to 1.9 % and 1.7 % of the forecast in May.
The expected growth in 2018 of 1,8 % remained unchanged.
After the estimates were published, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound has fallen by 0,5 % to $1,31 and by 0,4 % to €1,11.
The decision to maintain the current state came after the disappointing growth buried hopes for further growth - GDP stopped at 0.3% in the second quarter compared to 0.2% of the previous three months.
Growth is likely to remain at 0,3 % in the third quarter, although by the end of the year a slight increase should be made as expressed by the bank.
The latest inflation report is an inexhaustible comfort for households affected by rising inflation and poor wage increases. The Bank has indicated that the situation is getting worse before growth.
The report further states that monetary policy cannot "stop" income reduction in the next few years, but it is expected that wages will "extremely" come to the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy should also grow due to a high interest in British goods due to weak libre, which compensates for a lower percentage of consumer spending.
This decision came year after last year the interest rate was reduced to 0,025 % in response to the shocking vote on the EU referendum, which led to a decrease in the book.
The Bank estimates that the full integration of prices and the economy will take at least four years.
Prior to the bank's decision on the latest rates, many have demanded an increase in rates along with increasing inflation, which has further increased the pressure on households, and three political players have demanded a 0.5% increase in June.
Last month inflation fell back to 2,6 % of June 2,9 %, even though the bank indicated that such a change was expected and inflation should rise again during the next month.
The Bank stated that the 2 % overrun was "complete" as a result of the weak book.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Because of the recent drop in swap rates, it appears that competition on the mortgage market will only get on as soon as the creditors begin to compete for contracts with a good view of the end of the year.
The market seems particularly good for those who end up with existing contracts and recapitalisations - the offer offers options free of charge, as well as low rates that they get in shape."
NHS prescribes a controversial HIV medicine in 10,000 patients
From September, patients have gained access to ‘transformative’ treatment for HIV prevention based on the decision of the Supreme Court on NHS funding.
The English National Health Service (NSH) announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pill, which is used before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients up to 86%, will be offered through healthcare in approximately 10,000 patients within three years of experience.
NSH agreed to finance the trial period after the appeal court supported the decision of the Supreme Court of last year, stating that NHS had funds available to repay PreEP despite the declaration that the medicine should be financed by local authorities.
The decision announced on Thursday was adopted by NHS England from the mouth of Director General Simon Stevens as a ‘significant intervention’ while the decision described National AIDS Trust (NAT) as a ‘decisive moment’.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to accept patients. Other clinics will be connected in October and will be fully implemented across England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a HIV medicine given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PreEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among patients at risk.
PreEP prior to sex means that there is sufficient amount of specific medicines in the patient’ s body to prevent infection.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Among the tested patients are homosexual or bisexual men, transsexuals and HIV-positive partners who are not successfully treated.
The clinics shall identify eligible participants who sign the agreement to participate in the test, including men, women, transsexuals and individuals with a partner whose HIV status has not yet been controlled by the appropriate treatment.
People living and registered at GP in Great Britain can also sign up at their local sexual health clinic and consider the potential participation in testing.
The program will come taxable at £10 million and NHS England signed this week a contract for the distribution of medicines after obtaining an international public contract.
The trial period is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PreEP, its purpose, use and implementation to a large extent.
Simon Stevens added: ‘This important intervention should complement and make it increasingly difficult and more successful to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in over thirty years' effort to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health."
Deborah Gold, executive director of the National AIDS Trust, said: “We are witnesses of the decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PreEP is administered correctly and in patients at risk, it will offer the possibility of a change in the English HIV epidemic.
NSH will offer from September to patients exposed to high risk of HIV infection a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and independent of the need to talk to a partner, which will improve the quality of life of many lives.
We accept this statement with pleasure.'
Ian Green, executive director of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: ‘The priority number one must be rapid testing throughout the country; we must ensure its availability to each patient.
We now have an experimental medicine for PrEP and we are on a good path to protecting more than 10,000 people who are at risk of HIV infection.'
Shadow Ministry of Health Sharon Hodgson said: ‘The beginning of the trial period PrEP is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of postponement and suspension by the government.
Evidence indicates how transformative this medicine can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and the elimination of the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
The following tests will bring us closer to the full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that we start our tests as soon as possible throughout the country and protect those who are HIV-exposed and together end the spread of HIV in society.'
Life on high feet: the interface and smart design have changed this small apartment to the Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, exchanged a big house in Knightsbridge for an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of the smart Queen Anne terrace - and is a visual display of modern design that uses the maximum available space.
"In the past, I lived with my ex-husband in a much larger house in the Knightsbridge district," Joanne said.
"I've been looking for something more reasonable.
I ran into this apartment in Earls Court and had the same roof height.
I fell in love with him right away, and on the same day, I was staring at him."
Since then, the apartment has been in the size of 1000 meters of complete four-foot renovations.
The one-bedroom apartment with complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to walk through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add storage spaces and interface to use a high ceiling.
“I used to wear a high ceiling, large windows and many lights.
Such were my requirements," she said.
For this purpose, Erfan Azadi, from a design and design study, employed Duck & Shed with a seat in Notting Hill and used an almost four-metre ceiling to create a home that was not just a project, but also a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such heights that there were two spaces above it - the challenge for architects so it was to create an interspecies on which to walk.
Erfan must have involved his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is quite complicated," he explained.
“We had to arrange both rooms so that we could walk straight.
It was not only a simple platform, but at the same time a steel structure so that in the right height above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two precious rooms on each other - and at the same time add to dramatic ones.
In the space is a beautiful living room with an old brassy frame in the design of Retrovius.
The mirror furniture in gold, silver line and retro mirror Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in dramaticness, space and lighting.
The short walk is equipped with mirrors on both sides and looks so longer.
The mirror leaves in the kitchen look like a window to another room.
At the front door there are storage rooms equipped with mirrors for storage of utensils and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which lends the impression of a significantly larger space to the whole apartment, is the possibility to separate it from the kitchen if it is not used.
The kitchens are nothing new.
What is unique about this solution, however, is the closing door.
"We had to solve a technical page," says Erfan about the exposed doors.
"The door is counterbalanced to avoid very easily."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne has gained another 16 meters square, second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
"When it comes to this, what you sell is a residential area - or the appreciation of your property," Erfan said.
‘The real estate broker shall, in principle, calculate its price on the basis of the residential area when entering the apartment.’
In this case, it has been possible to raise the residential area while maintaining quality materials that lend space to a luxury look.
"Material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with your home," Erfan added.
“You don’t love the discharges of electricity in the walls.
Yes, it's important, but your heart doesn't get it."
As it turns out, the quality design and the increase of the living space can change the usual apartment to exceptional work.
And just like Joanne, you can finally decide to stay.
The United States is breaking up.
Cultural and political failure between the states is deepening with blue and red.
California has declared a ban on the travel of its citizens to the state of Tennessee and seven other states.
The Tennessee State paid for it and declared it a legal ban on the travel of its citizens to California.
Of course, it is not a ban in the full sense that citizens of the United States can travel freely throughout the 50 states.
It is that California has banned state money on the roads of its citizens to eight other states, including Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who's gonna stop this madness?
California is strong for LGBT and any demonstration of non-conformity with LGBT’s lifestyle is considered to be discrimination.
Tennessee, however, has adopted a law on conscientious objection, according to which a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with the treatment of patients in the LGBT community has no obligation to provide it, but has a duty to provide these patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have again adopted laws which stipulate that religious charitable organizations, which have received children from mothers after birth to adoption, are not obliged to provide these children with adoption to the same sex.
As a result of these laws on conscientious objection, California has banned the financing of its citizens' travel to the eight states of the Union from its resources.
In practice, this means that California professors are not allowed to have access to scientific symposia, for example paid from their universities in Texas, because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, to Tennessee with financial support from their schools.
They must obtain either federal grants on their way, but it is absurd for the federal government to finance public travel from state A to state B, or private sponsorship.
Tennessee has been patient and its parliament has adopted a law that also does not like California's policy of high taxes, high government expenditure, high deficits and the tolerance of illegal immigrants, but still does not apply to California because of this travel embargo.
He's throwing them off as a response to the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to every state of the Union, which would otherwise be a similar ban on travel for any reason.
At the same time, he has called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That's the fact, now you're commenting.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, everything is constitutional, nothing is constitutional.
States shall have the right to adopt laws on conscientious objection, as well as to decide what their money will go to and what they will not be allowed to do.
Secondly, what's wrong with the exception of conscience?
If a tailor has a religious problem selling pigs, why not offer only cattle, sheep, poultry, and fish?
Why do you have to sell it under the penalty even if the cutters offering the pig are enough?
In the state of Colorado, one baker faces an anti-discrimination complaint and a high punishment because he refused to bake a cake for a homosexual wedding.
But he also refuses to bake cakes for Halloween or alcohol.
Why don't you punish him and let him in the room and the proper cake not order at the hundred bakers of the others?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but individual states can adopt domestic domestic policies in powers which are not federal, to adjust according to their own preferences, i.e. according to the preferences of their citizens.
Then there is diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California!
Fourth, LGBT community members have at times legitimately tried to tolerate their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community are governed by the rule of life and are left to live, which should be governed by all reasonable people, but some activists do not try to be tolerant to themselves and others, but to be extremely intolerant to others.
According to them, no one should ever show moral, religious, or philosophical disagreements with LGBT's lifestyle, and if they do so, it should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They're modern-day enemies of freedom.
Fifthly, I don't know the situation in American history when states have done so on political issues, except in the case of one.
Even in the times of the civil rights fight of the Blacks, where the North and the West were on the side of integration and the South on the side of segregation, the states did not impose sanctions on themselves.
This was the only case in the 50th century, and the political cause was slavery and turned to the war in the North against the South.
Of course nothing like this will happen now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political gap between the states of the blue democratic and the red republican states is deepening and the United States is mentally disengaged.
Unauthorized agitation.
Critic Putina got a fat blow.
Russian opposition policy Alexey Navalnyj received a fine of 300 thousand rubles for violating the rules of the campaign before the presidential elections that will take place next year.
He was fined by the court for urging people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
In the last two months, Navalny organised two major anti-government street protests and announced that in March of next year he wanted to be the head of the state.
Chief Kremlu Vladimir Putin has not announced his candidacy yet, but he is generally expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to him this morning and took him to court.
He was tortured for calling people into demonstrations through videos posted on the YouTube website.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
"We'll cut them off from the judge's pay," he joked on the twitter critic Kremlu.
The Russian Electoral Commission has recently concluded that Navalnyj cannot participate in the presidential elections because he was previously convicted of treason.
However, the relevant judgment is considered politically motivated by the attack, which is considered to be a fighter against corruption.
The fines amounting to 300 thousand rubles, 25 thousand rubles were imposed by the Court on Thursday also by two members of the Naval Electoral Team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant character on the disbanded opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend the Naval in the campaign.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year penalty for stealing Kirovles.
In May, the verdict confirmed the appeal court.
The judgment is so powerful that it prevents the Inquisition from running under Russian law.
Brothers fight for an empire worth over $500 million
Two brothers now, more than four decades after the establishment of their Italian family empire, count on one of the most precious Victorian properties worth over $500 million.
Former director Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis is staying at the Toorak, only three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who argued about common property and commercial property to the highest court.
Paul wanted family business to leave already in 2014, but a sharp dispute is constantly being cleared up before the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, her own brothers in total 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first trade bought a family in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
This place was founded by the family Westco Jeans, which grew into a chain of 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the company sold its entire family in a recalculation of $85 million.
Other properties have been purchased for money and the portfolio of De Lutis' family now includes offices, buildings in Brunswick and Sorrento, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments and shopping centers in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one third of the company's assets, while his father Colin, who is according to Paul's words "significant force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family, owns two thirds of the assets.
The court records state that Colin owns a total of $316 million, while Paul manages a property of $176 million.
For Paul, the only problem was the distribution of property and financial resources.
"Colin's proposal has made it clear to me in his favour," Paul wrote in a local court statement in 2015.
Last Friday, after a few unsuccessful attempts at peace, the first session of the Supreme Court took place.
Now the brothers are also competing for who will control the existing business - from which Paula said Colin cut off.
Colin resists the fact that it's not true and accuses Paul of miscarriage with certain properties.
Colin stated in a previous local newspaper statement that he believed in a fair settlement of the conflict.
"My Italian origin dictates to me that the family is one of the most important," he wrote.
Hundreds of pages of site statements, e-mails and messages from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer are flooded by lawyers, including Allana Myerse, QC and defenders from both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants who had been operating milk bars and ice cream since the 1950s and bought a boarding school in Brunswick in the 1970s.
They bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when he founded Westco “in the last year of high school, Paul was still a little boy, about 10 years old. ”
Anna De Lutis stated that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped that the transfer of property to their sons would take place after good.
"Lugi often said he never wanted his sons to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family group. Colin stated that Mark was compensated for $10 million when he left and Luke for 26 million dollars.
As Paul, Luke and Mark stated, “they were not satisfied with the conditions of their financial compensation”.
Colin has since held back despite the fact that he is a former member of the AFL team, as he mentioned in his 2015 autobiography, Eddie McGuire, a famous television personality and best friend Colina.
Fairfax Media contacted Colina and Paul de Lutisova and their lawyers on Friday.
He answered Colin only through a textual report, in which he stated that, given the fact that the dispute is resolved before the court, "I have nothing to add".
“It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided on the whole matter before the court,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin stated in a statement at the Court of Justice that he was trying to adapt to his brother’s requirements.
"Our father would be very unhappy if he saw our current situation," he let himself be heard and added that "he still hopes for a good solution".
On Friday, all hopes were ignored.
"Our disputes will be resolved in a timely manner," Colin wrote.
Weather in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower the children.
The MDD drivers fascinate with water and summer clothing.
At the primary school of Na Chodovci in Prague 4, where there are now about 35 children, they only come out in the morning.
The school is after reconstruction and planted trees do not provide a large shade yet.
There's no pool there, but the teachers shower the children in the mill.
In the afternoon, the children remain in classes where the greens are lowered and the curtains are covered.
Air is trying to cool clean air because they don't have air conditioning.
It's also challenging for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature, which is inside and outside, exceeds the sanitary limits for maternal schools, so we should not have an open operation during this period," said the school director Miloslav Makovicová.
There's a glass corridor in the school, where it says the temperature is moving around 40 degrees.
We blow up at 6 o'clock in the morning, we close the windows and we have the greens on the south side that we're protecting.
"But it won't help much," she added.
The best conditions are in the forest school at Hráz in Hostivić, where children spend most of their time outside.
We have trees growing on the ground, so we're under them.
"We've got a beautiful pot, there's a table underneath it, and there's things we do," said Barbara Company's school director.
Teachers with children are trying to walk into a forest where the boy is bigger.
The kids have wet hats and have different water games on the program.
"We have a hand-pressed device that is used for flower cracks, and we use it for showering children," Company said.
The director of the maternal school in Novoborská street at Prague Proseku Jitka Vilimovská said that teachers of children are trying to stay in the shade and the drop is water.
"We have a relatively grown garden, so they're under trees," she said.
She goes out in the morning and then after 3:00.
Every child must have a head covering.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
For example, they can choose a little tea or a smooth juice and have a drink with water in the garden.
Every day they also have vegetable salads to eat, and always fresh fruits and vegetables brought to them by their parents.
"Perhaps here today one mother brought about a decimal melon for the children," Makovicová added.
Drivers get water or summer at the same time.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with hot days of water, ion drinks or summer districts.
Driver cabins tram and buses are mostly air-conditioned, DPP spokesperson Aneta Rēhková said.
Apart from the cabins, some trams are air conditioned in the passenger room.
The tram stations of high temperatures have so far not seriously damaged.
There was a minor damage in the shed in Hostivaři.
At present high temperatures, we make sure that drivers have enough drinks available.
"Refrigerated drinking water is available in all smacks, smacks and coaches," said Rēhková.
There are so-called sodas that are made of soda in the carriages and in some intermediate places.
Drivers also receive soluble ion protection drinks.
"They can also use summer uniform, which increases the comfort of drivers in their daily shifts," the speaker added.
The hot and dry weather of the last days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firemen throughout the Czech Republic liquidated 108, i.e. twice the long daily average.
On Tuesday, the day the temperatures in the Czech Republic splintered over 35 degrees Celsius, he employed firefighters mainly combating fire.
"They carry fires in the natural environment, as well as those associated with harvest work," said firefighter Nicole Zaoralová.
On the left, there was no evening change in the weather, when storms and tides were cut off in a row.
In connection with the firefights, the firemen went out to 236 attacks.
In particular, it was the removal of fallen trees and vines.
"The most affected in the Central Czech Republic," Zaoralová continues.
But the help of firemen was also needed in Stvolinka in the Českolipsk, where for the sake of storms 60 people were evacuated safely from the camp.
Tropical temperatures have also given work to the Prague rescuers.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the sanitizers drove out to ten cases of oxide poisoning with karma.
That's why people should let their water heaters check, the lifeguards warn.
Oxide is a colourless gas without smell, which is released during incomplete combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include anxiety, vomiting, headache, and feeling faint.
In the event of a suspected poisoning, leave the contaminated room.
Trump's new Chief of Staff plans to limit president's media diet
Many tried it before and always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
If so, it'll be the first.
Portal Politico stated that the new Chief of Staff in the White House plans to limit the flow of information from President Trump - including reports on television reports - in hopes that he will maintain Trump at a level.
Here's a part of the report by reporter Josh Dawson:
“When the new Chief of Staff of the White House John F. Kelly met on the first day in the new post with the staff, he identified the key problem of Trump's White House, which he intends to correct: incorrect information that gets the president into his hands.
Kelly told the employees that she must personally approve all the information - whether on paper or on speech - because the President can decide better on the basis of the right information."
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but a lot of his predecessors were in control of Trump and his presentation in the media broke their teeth.
Trump's relationship with the media dates back several decades - and now, when he sits in the White House, his habit of watching television news is even stronger.
"If Trump as a candidate was disturbed by honest reports, it was appropriate to show him that in the positive light he spoke about many other media that was easier to convince," said Politico Sam Nunberg, former campaign advisor in February.
Tara Palmeri from the Politico portal then wrote that "the key to maintaining Trump tweets on the back - at least according to the words of the six former organizers of his campaign - is to ensure that Trump regularly watches the media that sings praise to him."
Okay.
However, the idea that Trump's tendency to publish his views on Twitter was sometimes "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign organizers know something they don't know about - that Trump's tweets would be more exciting if someone didn't control them.
About tweets that Trump never sent, we'll probably never know.
If his employees managed to keep him on the back at least several times, their efforts failed.
However, no one has been able to prevent the Trumps regularly to raise controversial issues.
Part of this problem is that in the White House, which is made up of rival factions, people are regularly trying to strengthen their agenda by moving Trump materials - which they can, but do not have to be reliable - that support their view of the world.
The Politico Portal, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report in May on the willingness of advisors to submit questionable information to the head of state.
This is an example of the following information from the reporter Shane Goldmaker's pen:
“The current and former officials of Trump argue that the President often reacts very angryly to negative media reports, especially reports of information leaks, and tries to find their origin.
This situation came at the end of February when someone stressed to the president a copy of the article from GotNews.com - the website of the challenger Charles C. Johnson - who accused the deputy chief of staff of Katie Walsh of being the "source of many escapes of information" from the White House.
Regardless of whether Johnson has always been sued on Twitter for harassment; or that he has not submitted any evidence; or that he has already published a false charge in the past and has subsequently withdrawn it.
Trump read the article and started on Walsh's question."
Goldmaker added that the then Chief of Staff of Renice Priebus and Secretary of the White House Rob Porter "have tried to implement the system for the management and documentation of information received by President Trump".
Would that work?
Kelly's now, three months later, she's trying to put in the same strategy.
He may prove to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulsiveness will not just go away and his assistants still compete for power.
These constant factors of Kelly's mission certainly make it difficult.
Tourists negotiate a retreat and return to the "Millionary Quarter"
Several of the most affordable home owners in the West Midland County will be re-destroyed into the bridge with decided tourists who negotiate with local authorities on the right to regain the field for their residences.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in the countryside at the flourishing street in Solihull, which is renamed the "millionaire district".
Bringing horses, children and an army of caravans, tourists return after they were shown in May. They did not even fear a landing that was dug out on site on the basis of a regulation of the authorities in order to prevent their fall.
The tactical group found the gaps in the defense and penetrated the field with the caravans unprotected, which served the way.
The infirm residents of the district attacked the Solihull City Board by ‘not being able to solve the problem’.
One of the residents who wanted to remain anonymous said: ‘ They planted the place on Monday evening after they were moved to the street of Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at other people.
The Governing Council should be ashamed of its inability to resolve the problem.
All tourists were moved to another location and now they're back.
Last night they arrived next, and today they're probably even more.'
She added that : ‘The Birmingham Board of Directors knows how to load this problem. It uses judicial orders to protect parks.
I live on Streetsbrook, and I don't want to pay taxes until the board of directors manages with the tourists.'
Another of the anonymous residents said: ‘It’s ridiculous. We’ve just been watching the last travelling tourists and now they’re back.
And this time they're even more and this time they've brought horses with them.'
The Solihull City Board of Directors said: ‘We are aware of an unauthorised stay on the ground near Streetsbrook Road and, in cooperation with local police, we are taking the necessary legal steps to resolve the whole problem.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is necessary that as many locals as possible declare any non-social or illegal police conduct on number 101.
We're going to get such a picture that we're going to bring it to the court.'
My husband hit a Euroslancian car in Brussels.
He was brought by a government special.
The government special brought wounded Robert Žitnánský to Bratislava on Wednesday afternoon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport, and the plane was under constant control by Slovenian doctors.
The long-planned years have gone by without complications.
Robert Žitnjanský, according to TV news, had a major accident in Brussels early in the summer.
He must have been hit by a car, and he's been in serious condition ever since.
After the transfer to the authorities, one of the Bratislava hospitals was transported to a specialized workplace.
The economic analyst is the husband of Slovenian Euroslavanianian Janya Žitnjanské by NOVA.
She didn't want to say anything about the incident.
Couples have three children together.
Italy joins NGOs in the fight against rescue ships with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will prohibit the arrival of rescue vessels of NGOs which join the coast of Italy with Mediterranean immigrants unless NGOs sign new rules governing their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to imagine that they could continue in their operations," said Minister of Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with Turin Daily La Stampa.
The day came after the Italian authorities had played the ship of the German rescue organisation Jugend Rettet on suspicion of human trafficking, which greatly facilitates illegal immigration.
The rescue organisation, which is operating in the first year, refused to comment on the whole case on the grounds of the indictment by the Italian State Prosecutor Ambrogia Cartijos.
“It is for us, and there will always be a priority number one rescue of human lives. So we are very sorry that we cannot operate in rescue zones at the present time,” the organisation said in a statement on social networks.
"All current charges can only be commented upon after collecting all the information and assessing the whole situation."
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Iuventa ship of Jugend Rettet since October.
Her crew is suspected of transporting immigrants on board who were handed over directly to them by traders with people, and so on.
At least one meeting was reportedly only 1.3 miles from Libya's coast. The meeting was published by the Italian media.
The crew of the ship is suspected of violating the law and attending the Italian Coast Guard, who oversees rescue operations in this area - from humanitarian excitement, more than anything else.
The Code of Conduct establishes the presence of an Italian police officer on board a ship such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three out of nine non-governmental non-profit organizations participating in rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the Code: Save The Children, Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Active Open Arms.
The latter organisation indicated on Thursday that the new rules are not necessary, but acceptable, as they do not represent any "substantial change or obstacle" with regard to rescue operations.
For example, the adoption of the new Code of Conduct has also been rejected by the Association of Unlimited Doctors (MSF), which is the holder of the Nobel Prize.
In the meantime, Minniti has heard that the rapid decline of immigrants in recent weeks in Italy during rescue operations indicates that efforts to strengthen the sights on the coast of Libya and cooperation with local authorities bear fruit.
"In recent days we are beginning to look at the light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He also revealed plans for further negotiations that will take place this month with the Libyan elders on economic development initiatives, as well as representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that these countries will leave in the hope of achieving Europe.
Mesaroš is not ashamed. She's been hit by silicone and cellulite!
The hot summer days are totally pampering, just taking on the most necessary thing that will cover the most intimate parts.
Only Dominic Mesaroš does it the other way around.
At the afternoon meeting at the Prague Zoo, where the actors, moderators, singers and everything that has to do with TV Prima, just stumbled into the mini overhang.
And just a few usual moves and the model showed all her silicones, but also her ass.
He talked to her about how many times he set it up between half, and then he kicked it so high that she had to adjust it all the time.
The attention of the gentlemen and the photographers present certainly had no need.
Michelle Carter convicted of sending text messages leading to the suicide of Conrad Roye
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two years' imprisonment to incite her friend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Twenty-year-old Michelle Carter leaves 15 months of a two-year sentence behind bars and then spends five years in parole.
Carter was convicted in June of the accidental murder of Conrad Roye, who took his own life on 13 July 2014.
Roy’s father said on Thursday at the courthouse: “The whole family is broken.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was released until the decision was made.
She was threatened with imprisonment for up to 20 years, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy had suffered mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and cream blouses, Carter stood at the scene with tears in his eyes, his hands tied and his eyes directed to the ground.
"Its execution killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the judge.
“She ended his life to relieve herself.
She couldn't accept her own responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show any prints."
However, legal representative Carter said that it was "unfortunate circumstances that he is unforgivably sorry".
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “their age or level of vision or even mental impairment do not have a significant impact on its performance”.
The complainant read Roy’s mother Lynn Roy’s statement: “He won’t run away for one day so that I don’t grieve over my son’s loss.
I want him to be proud of me - I care for his sister and together we will bear the unbearable pain that we will bear with us forever," he said.
Roy's sister Camdyn Roy found out she's "following" her with the awareness that she's never going to participate in a brother's wedding and never be his aunt's children.
"The loss of the person I've seen since I was born is the pain that I'm going to bear in my life," she said.
The state of Massachusetts has no valid law that would affect a person who is helping another person commit suicide, so this case is a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in 2014 on the car seat, poisoned with carbon dioxide.
The case was brought to the attention of the entire nation after Carter's text messages were published, which led to suicide.
“I don’t care if you hang out, jump out of the building or stop,” wrote Carter’s text messages just two weeks before his death when Roy was on family leave.
A few minutes before he was killed, she wrote to him, "You have to do this to Conrade" and, "Just find a generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz pointed out that Carter was seeking attention through Roy's death and ordered her to refrain from any comment in the press.
The case has raised many questions.
One of the people who stood on Carter's side was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007. Two years ago, the charge was acquitted.
Ms. Knox (30) published a statement in the Los Angeles Times: "Michele Carter deserves to understand and help, not prison."
Audi adjusts up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to acute response
Just the day before the Audi car manufacturer announced that he would offer his customers an update of software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The president of the BMW said that the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" in response to European cities, including Munich, which are the seat of BMW, which consider banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that he will adjust three million Mercedes vehicles across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies referred to this decision as an Download.
European car manufacturers have promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to comply with the carbon emissions regulation.
However, nitrogen oxide released by diesel engines is considered to be carcinogenic and may cause asthma.
At the same time, there is an increase in vehicle costs in the installation of a gas neutralisation device for diesel engines, which facilitates the competitiveness of cars.
While German car manufacturers are facing careful visits, Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing a charge of detonating powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The company is trying to avoid Volkswagen's errors, which in an effort to meet the emission limits, installed software in its vehicles, which in testing reduced the amount of emissions, but under normal conditions the software was deactivated.
Several senior representatives of Volkswagen were accused in the United States and others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the engine development department in Audi would be arrested in Germany.
The former manager of Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian national and is not subject to extradition, so he may face a trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in the criminal investigation of the German police in the Volkswagen car sector after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system that was supposed to cover European emission limits - extending the charge that Audi is facing in the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation may have a negligible impact on Volkswagen: luxury car manufacturers make an immeasurable share of Volkswagen's profits.
The plane was forced to land on the beach.
The man and the girl are dead.
There was an accident at the beach Praia de São João in Costa da Caparica, about 30 km south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses to the TV channel SIC News said that the plane was flying right over the people who were on the beach.
Some people on the beach apparently fled from danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape from the machine.
A 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl died on the beach according to local media.
"The plane hit them and they were dead," said local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias.
Their nationality is still unknown.
On board the plane were two people, both of whom were taken out of the accident alive, and the police took them to interrogations.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
And the roads in the Czech Republic are complete?
I'll give you a guess.
It's impeccable, even though it started to build in 1978.
Even though it's impermeable, it's always being fixed.
And it can't be built any longer, even if it has a building permit.
What is it?
Yes, the D11 Train Station.
The construction of another section of it for at least a few months has just stopped the movement of the Earth.
We easters get a walkway, like they end up in a salaam.
They'll cover the ball and then they'll just see when and if we get any more.
Then we don't want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the time of the ride and we want to get a truck to Poland or from Poland from villages and cities.
Infinity trucks flow directly through the city of Jaroméř or Nachod, which is not like a reasonable object.
But so far, the last piece of our dream highway was carried out in 2008, that is, nine years ago.
Since then, not a stick.
So when the remaining four kilometres of unfinished section to Hradci Králová and other sections to Jaroméra began with archaeological research that began at the end of this year, you could hear the loud sound of the sponge in the eastern Czech Republic.
No one believed it anymore.
Last week it turned out that the building won't be built this year.
And maybe not next year.
The movement of the Children of the Land-Klub for sustainable transport from Brno has given an explanation.
Children of the Earth repeat their strategy of D1.
They've come up with a building permit decision all over the place.
They shall request the interpretation of all binding opinions already issued by all the authorities concerned.
For example, the Mayor, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Drainery Office.
So far, we've come from the D11 near the village with an excuse to call the funeral.
So we're going down, we're just going down the road, and then we're standing on the sidewalk, and we're giving priority to getting into the column.
The worst part is that you see similar stories all over the Republic.
Terrible, constantly en route to Benešov, D1 or D8 motorway.
Everyone's got a funeral.
What do the Earth’s Children Require?
What is the essence of communication building in the Czech Republic?
And why is the road network practically inexhaustible in the current system?

Levandule from Provence is threatening climate change
Levandules have become a symbol of Provence in the area of southeastern France, but are now threatened by climate change.
Levanduli lives as a result of dry climate and harmful moisture, causing fear on the faces of researchers and farmers who are looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, stated: “The production of olive groves in Provence is under threat because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings less precipitation in the spring and autumn.
This affects the life of the levandula.
They also have cicadas and beetles carrying micro-bacterials that are able to cope with in the dry climate."
There's a lot in the bet.
Levandule attracts tourists and oil that is produced from them is an important component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “The place of long and beautiful flowers is growing smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants.
The quantity of oil obtained from these lavenders is considerably smaller."
A possible solution can be more efficient distribution of water and slowing down the evaporation of water from the soil, as well as pressing the leverandula to protect the mixture of water and water and to treat several types of dry weather resistant.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threats in Mexico
The Riodoce weekly staff regularly meet every Wednesday to discuss the news of the disturbances taking place in the area of Sinaloa for the participation of organised criminals, corrupt officials and unscrupulous drug wars.
Today, however, under the stress of recent events, it is mainly due to its own safety.
They learn how important it is to change their habits.
Two well-deserved journalists are talking about what would be safer: taking their children with them to the office where someone attacked a grenade in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Safety experts wrote three simple words on the black table: opponents, neutrals and allies.
They ask journalists to give each word names - there is no need for proof, just use imagination and imagination.
Selecting them from what - drug dealers, politicians, traders and journalists are suspected of taking money from government or drug cartels - a catalogue of criminals whose task is to cover criminal proceedings.
Violence does not exist and the bodies are slaughtered in a crowd across the country; journalists are among them: according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 of them are from the presence of President Enrique Pena Nieta to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and seven of them were killed in all seven states this year.
Among them is the co-founder of the magazine Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and working as a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence that are associated with drug trafficking.
His loss is sensitive, although his presence is all-encompassing - a large photo of Valdez with the title "Justice", on which the average, hangs in front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over 30 years old, have a shirt with a photo of Valdez with a smile on their face, glasses on their nose and Panamanian hat.
The meeting takes place not quite two months after his death; journalists talk about each other's traumas, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor was established in 2010 to resolve the cases of journalists, two suspects have been sued, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur every year are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime. Murderers are so exceptional in getting to court.
Journalists from Riodoce insist that they will inform about the violence taking place in Sinaloa; although destruction is a pity and that territory is currently very treacherous.
Without information about the murders and without a sense of justice, the safety meeting is pointless, says Ibarra.
"It is foolish to waste time on such meetings," he adds.
"If we don't get more information, we can't trust anyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the center of Riodoce in Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloa.
He managed to capture several blocks when his red Toyota Corroll was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 shots, according to the title of the article - which can be translated as the Twelfth River.
The shooters then got into his car and ran it away from the scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left his wife and two grown children behind.
It seems that the news in Culiacan is spreading fast.
In Valdez's case, however, there's still a suspect.
Since Guzman's last arrest and his January release to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the country's most bloody battles, trying to fill an empty space by the rival group.
Every day several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloa, and the graves are full of two - footed mausoleum for drug kings, many of whom are larger than homes.
Remember, the word "proportional" means that one drug cartel controls a coastal state with precious ports and important routes that travel to the United States of America.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the risks of his employment, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoce are still demanding that he did not protect his friend.
He believes that two doubts led to his death.
The first was the February issue of the interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that waged the war with the sons of Joaquín Guzmán.
The peace could anger the sons; the suspect gang members collected all copies of the news at the time they arrived on the desks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after having had other news in which the same story was printed.
Valdez became a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is seen as an important milestone in the fight against Mexican criminals against journalists.
He managed to survive for so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed it would never change.
In Noroest magazine, he was practically vet when in 2003 he decided to sell his 50-dollar stock and start with five colleagues in Riodoce.
In Sinaloe, "it was impossible to operate a newspaper and not mention drug trafficking," Bojorquez said.
Riodoce eventually gained a good reputation for good news and good news; the news began to spread.
Journalists liked to go into trouble-taking and publish texts without censorship - readers were fascinated by reading stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after the foundation, Riodoce won Maria Moors Cabot's prestigious award for the Latin America report.
The same year Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for its ship's reports on Mexican drug trade.
Valdez openly admitted to fear.
"I was afraid of my life," he said when accepting the price.
Drug trading in Sinaloae is "the way of life", Valdez said in October last year in a conversation for Rompeiento TV.
“You have to take the role of a journalist - or play stupid.
I don't want anyone to ask me, 'What have you been doing face to face death... why didn't you tell me what's going on?'
The employees of Riodoce are in need of Valdez. The man was known for his humor and indiscriminate language. He was a good friend who loved to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to the bar of El Guayabo opposite the office and sat at the same table.
Now they're asking, did this routine blame his death?
His death in them also raised questions about his own assumptions - how to do his job the best and stay alive?
“They don’t like you messing with their wives, children, clean shops, secret harbors.”
"These things were banned," Bojorquez said.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and suicide.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel like there's nothing going on here, put your hands away.
The problem is, editor Riodoce Andres Villareal said, "What's the point of being crazy... and then it came to that thing with Javier."
The old rules according to him, like the others, in Sinaloae no longer apply - as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and the other states, which are home to a toxic mix of lucrative passports, weak governments and corrupt policies.
The country is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees meet, no mobile phones are allowed; a few days ago Spyware was discovered, which was purchased by governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two police officers find a bay in front of the 40 - degree air in the shadow of a nearby tree.
They were chosen by the state to protect the Riodoce office, which is located in a four-storey building in the town district of Culiacan.
Journalists argue that just these policemen do not belong to those 50 percent of law enforcement officers who are said to be corrupt governments.
It's been a few months since the press last released into the hilly areas that essentially control drug cartels.
There are three main stories on the program this week.
The first is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio César Chávez in Sinaloe.
They are also dedicated to suspected government expenditures that took place in the home city of the governor of the state.
A few kidnappings have also recently occurred in one of the most luxurious restaurants in Culiacán, just a block from the State Representative's office.
Officially no one has reported the identity of the kidnapped people or the circumstances of kidnapping, so journalists took note when they were about to write about what every city's inhabitants know: that the restaurant is the favorite destination for drug dealers and politicians.
One of the journalists counted from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name associated with a certain policy that is a member of the Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which controls all levels of the political scene almost all over the past century.
Several PRI governors have recently been charged with high-level corruption.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about the previous incidents that occurred in the restaurant, including the incident in which one of the sons of Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán avoided the military intervention unit.
A month ago, readers would read about this subject in Valdez's section, which was the best source of information on abortions.
"Valdez would certainly have solved the case," said Villarreal (46), who is renamed "El Flaco" for his bald character.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office has turned into a ceduli warehouse and a label for protests against the killing of journalists. The employees certainly did not expect them to become press activists.
The journalist Miriam Ramirez came across a few notes and the following morning he appeared to protest at the state representative's office for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared only three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of the state of Michoacán.
There was only a burned body discovered, and the authorities say it's Adamea based on DNA analysis.
The activity of journalists is expanding throughout the country. Many of them organize protests and attack the “SOS print” corridors and buildings.
The director of the news of Bojorquez is the day of a visit to Washington, where he is trying to obtain international support and achieve justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with Governor Sinalay, who took place the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of monitoring journalists and their murder for reporting the truth.
Meanwhile, she asked to be transferred to another department for fear that her anger might threaten her impartiality.
Valdez repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are "encumbered" by organised crime, corrupt officials and the loose public.
In his last book Narco-Journalism, he wrote that journalists die not only by hand of drug cartels but also by ordering politicians and security forces to cooperate with organised crime.
The media surveillance group Article 19 accused more than half of all attacks on police journalists and public officials.
"You will die in Mexico because they want to silence you," Ramirez added.
The murders are obviously working.
No one will forget the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Macías, who came six years ago at the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found together with a message allegedly signed by the cartel Zetas: “This is how I ended up for my reports.”
There was a keyboard and an earphone next to her head.
Some branches decided to end the activity, such as the newspaper El Norte with a seat at the northern borders of the state of Chihuahua in response to the March murder of the rapporteur Miroslavy Breach.
Others continue to do so, as did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after his director was killed in 2004.
In 2010 Diario de Ciudad Juarez referred to public drug cartels as an article on the front page entitled “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists have fled their homes or even across the border.
It's an awkward decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, as is ridding yourself of the feeling that someone is constantly stalking you.
And journalists are persecuted and killed, for example in the case of Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in the apartment in Mexico City, three months after the flight from Veracruz.
For those who have decided to stay and not give up their job, it is a big risk every day.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, so I became a journalist," he said.
It's Friday afternoon, and Riodoce employees are sitting on the hall in front of the office - the latest edition sent to the printer - drinking beer when the phone starts calling.
It is reported that 19 people died during the shooting between gang members and police officers near the beach resort in Mazatlán.
The war is escalating, just as many messages left in this area were promised by members of the union.
Newspapers publish this news from mobile phones on Riodoce's website.
It will not run for one day and the initial title will be changed again.
The sound of the police sirens indicates another shooting.
Bojorquez takes a quick look at the police station to see if they're paying attention.
If they're afraid, they don't reveal it at all.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their journal - whose average is an excuse for the entire Sinaloe - all the Riodoce employees follow his steps.
“How can we just think about leaving,” Bojorquez said, “when on the same day that Javier was killed, one of the internalists asked me to send her to the streets?”
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a shocha, whatever.
Researchers have now discovered the conclusions of the first discovery of a wonderful creature about the size of a rhino, whose perfectly preserved remains - which experts called "Mona Lisa dinosaurs" - found a Canadian mine.
The residues were kept to such a high level that the experts were able to determine the red color of its dirty skin and indicate that the dinosaur had a “problem past”.
The article in the Journal of Current Biology stated that it is “the most enduring ever discovered reverse dinosaur and one of the best types of dinosaurs in the world”.
The rock is a new species of Nodosauridae. Dinosaur lived in the period of the Creed, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition literally shocked researchers who described him as “in fact remarkable”.
According to National Geographic, the reverse veterinarian is the best-kept stoner of his species.
Shawn Funk, who discovered the rock on March 21, 2011 when he turned down Suncor Millenium near Canada's Alberta.
He stumbled upon something that looked like a foreign object and decided to examine it more closely.
The stone was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working on the discovery of an animal from a huge piece of land weighing 1100 kg.
After completion of work, the dinosaur is ready to reveal.
“It’s enough to blinden your eyes and believe you’re asleep,” said the leading work of Caleb Brown and the naturalist of the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is exhibited.
"It will certainly be recorded in history as one of the most beautiful and preserved types of dinosaurs - Mona Lisa dinosaurs."
By studying his skin researchers found that this beekeeper - although he was covered in armor and reminded of a walking tank - was most likely facing a serious threat from mass-fat dinosaurs.
The heavily reverse dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a masking system that uses many today’s animals.
Experts claim that this has made it possible for him to cope better with his surroundings and avoid his enemies. The masking system indicates that he was a favorite food for larger dinosaurs.
News of 110 million years old dinosaur leader Nodosauridae first appeared in the newspaper in May. Currently it is available for viewing at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers gave him the name Borelopelta markmitcheli after Mark Mitchell's museum, which, along with the team, spent more than 7,000 hours with careful discovery of fossils.
Thanks to the wonderfully preserved state of fossils, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the samples and shape of sheds and armor all over the body.
They discovered the method of masking used by today's animals in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this masking effect is common in nature, the discovery of researchers is surprising because Borelopelta's size is far superior to today's animals using the same technique.
It is therefore possible that dinosaurs were such a number of predators that evolution gave preference to masking before confrontation in survival.
Many modern animals with masking - such as deer, zebra and or frog - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as a benefit, indicating that nosodaurus had to fight for his survival literally.
“The transmission of a huge and heavy reverse dinosaur apparently illustrates the dangers posed by predators during the cry,” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic components contained in the pits also revealed that dinosaurs had probably reddish-brown skin.
Researchers continue to study animals and look for further knowledge of their life, including the preserved contents of the stomach, to explore their last food.
He believes that the dinosaur fell into the river after he died and was taken to the sea where he drowned at the bottom.
In the area of Alberta at that time there was the same climate as in today’s Florida and rivers and oceans have moved much further into the interior than it is today.
“This nodosaurus is really remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved rotten skin and is also preserved in three dimensions and so we can see its original size,” said Brown.
“For these reasons, the animal looks practically the same as in the time of the cry.
You don't have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; it's just a little blurred and it seems like he's just sleeping.'
During the time of the crisis, huge earthquakes, mass - consuming dinosaurs, which moved on two legs, passed through the earth.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyronasaurus reg - lived for several million years after Boraelopelta, this reverse dinosaur could be the favorite advantage of his equally terrible ancestors.
Among them are Acrocanthosaurus, 11.5 meters long monster weighing more than 6 tonnes.
Researchers, whose latest findings were published in the Journal of Current Biology, believe that Borelopelta’s body was floated into the sea after being mummified in the bath.
Shawn Funk, who discovered the rock on March 21, 2011, was found returning to Suncor Millenium at the bottom of Canada's Alberta.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved reverse dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, which is also complete from the jaw to the jaw.
The animal reached an average length of 5 meters and weighed up to 1300 kg.
He had two 50 cm left in his shoulder.
Researchers believe that this exhaler has been evaporating the land of Canada today until it ends in a river that has flooded it into the sea.
His underwater grave kept the body in perfect condition.
Fossil residues of this type are also preserved to the extent that the rotated plates around the skull are still covering the rest of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, “finding such a preserved individual can be compared to winning the lottery.
The longer I follow him, the more shocking the finding seems to me.
Fossil residues of this type are also preserved to the extent that the rotated plates around the skull are still covering the rest of the skin.
On his side lies his right foreleg with his fingers pointing upward.
I can easily count the holes on his feet.'
How did one activist find out the answer to the question, 'Who Streets?'
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell collapsed all over the body.
The day after she arrived in New York, a parent from St. Louis sat on a bed in an airbnb room and made Facebook contributions on her phone.
At the same time, she ran into some high school student's contribution.
"The police just shot an 18-year-old young man whose body is still lying on the street," he said.
She was surprised that no one else wrote her this post, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The user @TheePharoah constantly retweeted her contributions to the wall.
Rapper from St. Louis published his post on Twitter about Michael Brown's death, an unarmed 18-year-old young man shot by a white-haired police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photo of Brown's body, which is lying in a stateless street from which no one has taken it for four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She left the phone to come back to him the night she watched tweets about the people who were meeting at the Canfield Drive.
She watched a picture of police bands and shouting people. One of the men claimed that the victim's father was holding a note with the inscription "The Ferguson Police killed my unarmed son"!
She was watching live reports - one of the police stood before a group of protesters, holding in the hand of the leader and his other end of the jumping dog.
In another video, another police officer was holding the gun he was pointing at and saying, "I'm going to kill all of you... animals."
"It's not normal," Ferrell said.
“This isn’t the type of murder we used to and we can call normal.
I felt a bunch of skin all over my body.
"I was angry and cried."
She immediately booked a return flight, and the next day she traveled home.
After landing at 23:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years describes the new document ‘Whose Streets’, which will be released into the cinema on 11 August.
It is a story of survival and protests, love and resistance, strength and inbreaks told from the point of view of the people living in the community who go out to the streets and demand answers.
On her way to Ferguson, Ferrell started a dialogue with her daughter - dressed in a flower dress and the same flower front - on the subject that had already been discussed many times - "about black experience".
"Do you remember how I taught you how black people had to fight for what they believed in?" he recalls the conversation.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old and that's not right."
"It did not seem that I would not take it with me," Ferrell later said.
“Today’s events are the fulfillment... of what has happened in the past.
She had to know and see it in her own eyes and grow up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but at the same time she had to know the difference between different layers of experience with blacks and what we have to do to get rid of ourselves.
Although I am able to provide her with conditions in which she does not experience on her own skin racism, it is in no way different from another black child-wife.
I feel that if I were to protect her from this experience, I would only harm her."
After arriving in Ferguson, South Florida Road was the first stopover to the police department, which became the basis for activists who expected the words of police officer Darren Wilson about his possible involvement in the incident.
This is where Ferrell and his daughter met a local businessman who prepared for the rest of the food.
Together they prepared food in bags and helped spread it to Protestants.
In the eyes of Ferrell, a new type of activism began to be born slowly.
"My activism turned up on my feet after 9 August," said Ferrell, adding that when she studied at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was the president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. association and was trying to introduce health care and food in black communities.
“I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural."
A few weeks later, during the evening demonstration, Ferrell met with a later co-director, Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farnar wanted to "document only" the current events.
However, Ferrell thought: "Are you working on a document or are you trying to find a story that could be used?"
Such a type of skepticism penetrated the community through many people, often whites, who wanted to earn on pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in a recent discussion: “We have heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson are very often overlooked and we wanted to change that. ”
Folayan has already been working with co-director Damon Davis, who is a well-known local artist who deals with the subject of prisoners at death.
His participation in the project was also interested in Ferrell and with six other local residents who were following the "Whoes Streets?" team in the years following Brown's murder.
"There's no one talking about us in this document, but it's our statement," Davis said.
"That was important to me - how these people will be represented - because I will be represented in the same way."
While the aim of the document was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences - in an effort to show that the movement "not about the rescue leader, but about the proximity of the community," Folayan said - proved that it was precisely she who was more confident about participating in the film.
The document "Whose Streets?" describes the very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, for example, how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrell with a smile on her face when thinking about the first moment she saw the final version of the document.
"But I understood that in order to do this job and to protect the black people, I have to open myself."
In addition, Ferrell's story highlights the role of the middle black woman in the wider aspect of Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who created in response to the murder of Teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 on social media campaigns under #BlackLivesMatter - call themselves weird.
"Black women in the leading positions are ultimately behind the movement," said Ferrell, "because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black middle women must bear the burden of these events."
Folayan agrees with this statement and adds that “the movement is actually supported by black women and a large number of middle black women.”
However, it insists that "this is not just an affidavit" and that Ferrell is not the main hero document for his opinions.
"That was exactly what she was driving power and energy," she said.
“It is not a coincidence that it was just in the front lines, because life on these crossroads in the skin of a black woman is dangerous.
You feel the energy in front of the screen."
In the meantime, back in Ferguson, TV stations have cleared up their position, but heavy racial ties between the community and the police survive.
Ferrell is a two-and-a-half-year condition for blocking the road during demonstrations.
The social political atmosphere in the area that she calls home described as the "disorder".
Yet he does not stand in his efforts, which she has been committed to since she went to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
The only thing we can lose is our chains."
There was a field burning on Kolinska.
There were dozens of firemen on the scene, helping with the helicopter.
Not far from the Czech Boat in Kolinska, between the towns of Bylana and Liblica, it burned from 14:00 a.m. field about 15 hectares.
The fire stopped spreading around 15:15, firemen declared the third stage of the fire flame out of four possible ones.
According to the spokespersons of Ladislav Holomčík, he helped fire fire from the air and a helicopter.
At 18:00 the fire was extinguished, the fire damaged 700000 crowns.
Tens of professional and volunteer firemen fought on the spot.
The fire was caused by a technical malfunction in the engine room of the van.
Hasit also helped a helicopter that carried out a total of six wells of water.
"Instead of the intervention, we have handed over the owners until 8:00 tomorrow to watch him by the volunteer fire department," Holomčik said today.
And Becoming Resemblance: the artist creates portraits using the DNA of Chelsea Manning
In the middle of one of the rooms of New York's Fridman Gallery there are just a few faces of different shades of skin - white, black and breakfast - hanging from the ceiling on the wires.
All 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from the mouthpieces and hair sent by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth prison, where a former analyst repudiated the 35-year penalty for unauthorized publication of WikiLeaks' secret cableograms.
The new exhibition, which was launched on 2 August, bears the name A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, which combines his experience with technology, computer science and art, and Manning - a transsexual and provocative dissident whose punishment reduced Obama three days before his departure from the U.S. presidency.
By algorithmic DNA analysis Manning and by using 30 portraits to illustrate how a person with this genotype would look, Dewey-Hagborg's brat created, unless an intellectual commentary on DNA subjectivity - as well as in many ways that DNA can be interpreted - and the unimaginable determinism of these interpretations, as well as identities.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward Manning, has been talking about being considered a woman since her youth. She was convicted in 2013 on the basis of twenty complaints, including violations of six spy laws, computer fraud and theft.
All her photographs were kept by the prison staff. Only one black-and-white photograph of the lower quality was avoided to the public, on which Manning, apparently concerned, sits on the driver's seat in the platinum blonde paruce, which is now connected.
In 2015, they still received positive reactions to the Dewey-Hagborg project from 2012 Stranger Visions.
Under this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects - such as cigarettes and gums - to create images of these people.
And right this time, she got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They were going to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to complete the article with the portrait," Dewey-Hagborg explained when opening a new exhibition.
However, visits and photographs were not allowed, so they turned to Chelsea with a question as to whether she would be interested in DNA portraits.
The artist and her prisoner must have been embalmed for two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic book called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, who presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea was loved and could participate in the exhibitions personally.
President Obama actually requested the release of Manning a few days after the comic book was released, which was a welcome change after several years of unbearable military prison in Kansas.
Indeed, it is interesting that the exhibition is taking place right at the time Donald Trump is waged a war with people who are trying to publish government information and transgender soldiers, while trying to find new ways to encourage solidarity with their tweets in areas that should be supported.
In response to the question about this particular timing, Dewey-Hagborg stated that "everything is happening for some reason".
Under the declaration of the artist on one of the wall of the gallery, Manning calls with his huge signature (the letter "i" in the name is poured out by the heart) after the end of the "self-contained fractionation based on sex, race, sexuality and culture".
On the opposite side are the sequence of its mitochondrial DNA - a hundred letters C, G and A marked with ink.
By listing 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to a sophisticated scientist's artist) Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least on the biological side, we are all.
“I hope that people will take care of it, that our genome does not depend on who we are, and that genetic data are subjective and everyone can explain it according to their own,” Dewey-Hagborg said.
"DNA will tell many different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last copy of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page from the above-mentioned graphic novelty.
He's showing Manning who's making his way to King Kong from the United States Discipline Barracks prison with a megaphone in his hand.
"As soon as you are prevented from speaking, they will win," it says.
"Don't ever let your mouth shut."
"It's a direct copy of one of the letters," said the Philadelphian artist.
"When I think about it, my skin's ticking."
Manning has not personally visited the exhibition so far - which has been predicted in the comic book - but when this happens, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room with its masks, its own genomic features, arranged as a gift of Protestants.
This was also for the purpose of the exhibition, including nearly 160 cm of high maning soybeans, on which her genetic hapoloscopies are barely recorded.
"In the past, they were placed on the walls, but this time I wanted to make them feel dava," Dewey-Hagborg said about portraits.
"I wanted to convey the impression of mass movement that takes Chelsea's shape and frees her."
Professor of Northwest University and employee of Oxford University for murder
In these days, the police are conducting an international investigation into professor of the Northwest University and the Oxford University staff who are charged with suspecting the murder of a man who was found freed from death in a luxury Chicago apartment.
On Monday, a arrester was issued for the murder of the first degree in a man named Wyndham Latham (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, says the Cook County Judicial Register.
The document says that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died as a result of several wounds.
The Chicago police reported that the body of the dead was found on July 27th.
The police were informed by telephone. Upon arrival at the Grand Plaza Apartments, the victim was found in one of the apartments with several market injuries.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead and the detectives are investigating the case as a murder.
Lathem has worked as a professor of microbiology and immunology at the Northwest University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubebage, Vice-President of the University for Public Relations, stated in his e-mail statement that Latham is now on administrative leave and has been denied access to university school premises.
"The whole matter is now being investigated by the competent authorities and the Northwest University is fully cooperating with them," Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial manager at Oxford University.
Speaking universities and Somerville College stated in an e-mail statement: “The British police contacted us and we are ready to assist the American police as well.”
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wished to report to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, who is in contact with the public of the Chicago Police Department, stated that he is calling on suspects to surrender to the competent authorities.
"The police have information about their whereabouts and the attempt to investigate suspects is getting worse," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national authorities are helping the investigation of suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who was alerted to the events that were to occur in apartment 1008.
The police described the whole scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27th.
He added that Latham and Warren were captured by security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," said Guglielmi.
Grand Plaza's management issued a statement for all residents: "The police are now working on drawing up a timetable and profile of the victim and investigating various motives, including domestic violence."
"In the near future, we will complete the Wada plan" - Vice-President of the Russian government Mutko
Vice-President of the Russian Government Vitaly Mutko stated that it will not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSada).
“At present, part of the criteria for the new plan has already been completed and RUSada has already obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this fact, the WADA plan was updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The vice-president commented on the second part of the WADA plan aimed at drafting the Code - which describes the criteria for renewing the validity of RUSADA - which was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutka, the codex does not contain anything that Russia should be concerned about.
“All has been notified and everything will also be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and Wada as soon as possible," he added.
However, one of the above criteria calls after the public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation, which Richard McLaren investigated, for the alleged sponsorship of Russian sportsmen's doping by the government.
On this subject, Mutko said: “We know the investigation, as our antidoping system has obviously failed.
It has been granted all measures.
However, there have been no state programmes in our country and we cannot therefore admit to anything that has never existed."
Vitaly Smirnov, Director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission, confirmed his words.
In his interview with Russian RSport Smirnov, he acknowledged the problems of Russian anti-doping agents, but added: “On many occasions we have indicated that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report entirely without exception," Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSADU of carrying out doping controls in Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organisation allowed the planning and pooling of testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) this June.
Following a visit by the Moscow Centre of the organisation in July, Director General Wada Olivier Niggli stated that RUSada is “in the right way” to restore its validity.
The police have accused three people. One is young.
The police accused three men of setting up a central fire of a rare wooden church in Trinc-Gutech on Frýdecko-Městek.
One accused is young, all three are Czech.
They are threatened with a criminal offence of up to 15 years in prison.
To the press today, Moravian Police Director Tomáš Kužel told them.
He said it was an intentional crime.
"It is a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the motive of the whole matter," Kužel said.
He indicated that the police would deal with possible arrests of the accused.
Further information cannot be published by the Director.
"What I can't tell you so far is that there's actually a criminal police and investigation and a state agent who's monitoring the case," Kužel said.
The wooden church of God’s body in Gutesh dates back to the 16th century.
He was a valuable monument with many original equipment and images from the first half of the 16th century.
Significant damage will be estimated to be tens of millions of crowns, but the historical loss is countless.
After the fire, the plots began to be considered for the restoration of the churches.
Most of the costs should cover the insurance, other costs are prepared to be shared with the Ministry of Culture and the city, a public collection is also prepared and calculated with the contribution of the memory owner, i.e. local parishes.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine of the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrab also destroyed fifteen years ago a fire.
It was then the electrical installation dispute.
Then there was an exact copy in his place.
The State is counting on citizens to defend the state.
He'll support their training.
With financial support for defence companies, voluntary training or training trainers, the purpose of the law on the readiness of citizens to defend the state is to be taken into account.
The Ministry of Defence, which has received its processing as a task from the government, promises to improve the physical efficiency of the Czechs and their capabilities, which could then be used in crisis situations.
It comes from a proposal prepared by the Ministry.
If the law were to be adopted in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns in defense.
The main objective of the proposal is, according to its authors, to create an effective system that would help increase the readiness of the Czech Republic to defend the state, outside the exercise of the defence obligation and on the basis of voluntaryity.
For example, the State would support networks of radio amateurs, shooters or cynologists with financial or material resources and would enable them to increase their membership.
In return, he would obtain information about people who are willing to come to help the country if necessary at the time of the crisis and about their abilities or material equipment.
Accredited instructors could also be available to assist companies and other stakeholders in training or training.
It is also calculated by organizing words with war veterans or people who behaved heroicly.
One possible option assumes that there would be a new office to care for the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal stress that participation should be voluntary and should be able to use their abilities until the state of threat has been declared.
"The whole concept must respect the progressive bridging of earlier apparent boundaries between individual types of threats," is stated in the context of a reference to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministers have noted that it is therefore necessary to focus on supporting as many capabilities as possible, not just those military.
"The basic aim is to create a very broad foundation that allows every citizen to respond adequately to the situation of the state or life, health and property of persons, to protect himself, if necessary contribute to the protection of others, and not to impose wrong conduct on the performance of the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic," the aim is stated.
The adoption of the law would bring a lot of financial demands.
According to the Ministry, their amount will depend on the choice.
For example, the Authority envisages financial support for projects to prepare citizens for public defence up to up to 100 million crowns.
If an administrative and coordination centre was set up, its operation could cost about 60 million crowns a year.
Other money would go to pay or to build an information system.
The proposal also assumes that the scope of the regional military command would have to be extended to employ 42 other soldiers together.
The Ministry's representatives have already stated that the law should also help to resolve the disagreement of some Czech policies with the introduction of the European Union Directive on the holding of arms.
His adoption would allow the shooters who will be part of the system to leave some of the weapons prescribed by the directive.
Startups that will help your company not to be with another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the level of satisfaction of the employees of her e-commerce startup, but she didn't find the appropriate research.
The answers were often inaccurate, useless, or even misleading.
And even though she promised an anonymous investigation, some employees expressed their mistrust in the whole process.
"I was looking for consistency and objectivity," said Errett, owner of the e-commerce company's Madison Reed with a San Francisco residence, which employs 75 people.
So she asked for help outside.
New startups from the human resources sector are constantly on the market, helping companies to explore the satisfaction of employees.
The creation and licensing of software for the specific purpose of measuring employees’ duties enables startups to conduct rapid voting, to target specific teams and demographic groups, further offers a complete anonymity of employees and a hot link to complaints, and in some cases also allows informants to be visited and contacted directly by the Director.
"There are tools like Strava and Fitbit on the market that follow your health status, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of the Glint startup based in Reedwood City.
Errett said that in three years' time, Glint got more aware of what her employees thought and how they felt.
In addition to quick surveys and voting of specific teams, Glint offers a company temperature map and a concise overview of groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as a list of low-rated managers - which allows users to work on repair.
Communities are beginning to realize that it is necessary to take care of the culture of the working environment - in the event that another Uber becomes one of them - which is confused in the scandals after the former employee published on his blog a contribution describing the business environment and the difficulties of employees who dare to speak openly.
For startups like Glint, the demand for company culture surveys is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let's Talk Payments website, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and compliance sector can exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
Startup Converter from Denver, Colorado, who helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour, has seen a small increase in interest and activity at the beginning of the year, just before Uber's scandals.
Among almost 600 Converter clients are Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber's recently accepted it under his wings too.
Like Glint, Converter allows companies to send custom "bright" research, collect confidential information in real-time and display hot maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous textual hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
If the Director-General is involved, complaints shall be sent directly to the Administrative Board.
"The court of public opinion has authorized regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and executive director of the Convercent startup.
If the company is proved guilty of misbehaving with its employees or of non-ethical conduct - and if the regulator does not do so - it may face costly consequences as a result of the boycott of customers, the exhaustion of employees or judicial proceedings, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant network, which employs more than 25,000 people over 500 locations, uses Convert more than a year to raise employees' awareness of corporate principles and procedures and to ensure an easy way to contact corporate management.
Earlier, if the employee wanted to report any problem, he had to check the phone number or e-mail for management of the company, officially provide complaint and hope in a fair solution.
Often it was a frightening and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, deputy general Ruby Tuesday, who said that there was no reliable way to monitor employees' complaints.
Now that Convercent is being used, rapid detection and resolution of problems that have never occurred before to managers sitting in offices have been ensured for miles away from the actual settlement of complaints - such as discrimination, difficulties or unfair treatment.
"It is coming closer to a holistic, overall view of employee experience," said Vitrano, who runs Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"At the same time, we protect shareholders from judicial disputes on the part of employees."
The companies stopped taking ethics, values and employee participation in light weight in 2002 after Arthur Andersen’s accounting company collapsed after Enron’s collapse in the abuse of employee’s ethical rights, Quinlan said.
But only when "you've spent all your time on social media," companies began to realize that they couldn't just hide their churches in a box in the online world.
"Before people began to use technology to monitor ethics, they relied on faith," Quinlan added.
Glint and Converter offer their software in the form of a service for which companies pay regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity approved by courageous capital investors who supported both startups.
Convercent chose $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital as part of his February campaign and finally took the capital of $47 million.
Glent won $10 million in November from Besemer Venture Partners and won $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are a surprise because of the mutual nature of companies, cultures and venture capital.
The increasing number of research clearly confirms that today’s employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, they are not the main advantage of high wages and interesting projects.
Employees want to believe that they are accepted and appreciated and that they spend their time in a company that is striving for a positive message.
“If people are happy in their work, they feel that their voice is heard, and that their work is rewarding, they strive for the success of the company,” said Nina McQueen, Vice-President of Global Benefits and Employee Benefits LinkedIn, who uses Convert and Glent.
Investors make profits if companies and companies make a profit if they are satisfied with their employees.
And when there is an analytical tool on the market that ensures employee engagement and commitment to the company, it is not surprising that there are many investors who support this effort.
According to labour culture experts, it is important to provide employee satisfaction data.
But the data itself is pointless if the company does not take the necessary steps.
The fact is that once the company requests feedback from its employees, there may be major changes.
And if the change does not occur quickly - in the worst case at all - it can lead to disappointment and not concern for employees.
"As soon as you ask for 4000 opinions, you must be prepared for 4000 conversations," said Russell Raath, CEO of the Kotter International Consultant, who was a witness to many companies that relied too much on the data itself.
“Because as soon as you don’t get to the end, the employees start asking themselves, ‘ Did they hear me at all?
They care about me?
And if not, why should I be interested?"
Madison Reed, who is now conducting a regular survey of employees every month, is able to solve the problem by one day, says Errett.
After collecting feedback from employees who were frustrated by slow decision-making and communication quality, Errett managed to reorganise several teams within the company and start communication training to solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday acquires a very important view of her employees and hopes that in the long term this will achieve a high level of employment in the area known to her by her frequent release.
"If you do not try to create a transparent working environment, employees will not believe you," Vitrano added.
“And as soon as you start losing your employees, you will lose customers.
And with the flow of customers, the whole company is breaking down."
Thursday became the hottest day.
Thursday is the hottest day of the year in the Czech Republic with 38.3 degrees recorded in The Watchtower.
He won such a Tuesday, which was originally the warmest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
The staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute were informed of this.
On the contrary, on Thursday, but there were not many temperature records.
Vedra hit Morava mainly, in the Czech Republic it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, records were either beat or levelled to 35 out of 145 meteorological stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, the record was recorded only nine long-term measurement stations.
Perhaps today’s temperature in The Watchtower was the same as the previous 2013 record.
In Lednica, today's 37,4 degrees, the original maximum of four tenths of the grade was exceeded and in the current 37,1 degrees, the record was exceeded by three tenths.
Both records came from 2013 as well as from Watchtower.
High temperatures appeared today mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After the Watch Tower, there was the largest wind in the Dyjakovićs on Znojemska and the Brod nad Dyjjs on Bréclavska, where the mercury flowed to 37,8 degrees, but the record did not exceed.
On the contrary, in the western and north-west Czech Republic, for example, the ČHMU website has so far been the highest temperature in just about 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures there started to grow so late this afternoon," the meteorologists reported.
The current winds in the Czech Republic will gradually disappear according to ČHMU and more significant rain may come on Sunday.
Most Moravia sites will remain high temperatures on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia on Saturday.
We've had such a mess here.
Billionaires do not have the same vote in elections as any single adult in the country.
They want to decide directly, and because not everyone is as bold as Andrej Babish, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
Owner Penty Marek Accompanie with other colleagues behind the waters Martin Burdou and Antonín Fryč sponsor Robeyšková Realists.
The second life of the Civil Democratic Alliance is funded by the owner of the insurance and business in the realities of Pavel Sehnal, who is also its chairman.
The convicted corrupter and the king of Czech gambling Ivo Valent ordered the Private Party.
The political movement of Agrofert, as Andreje Babiše's project did not name the mayor Jaroslav Germany, is a chapter for himself.
Their billionaires have recently also been captured by the Elders.
He's Dalibor Grandpa, the company's owner of the Jablotron security facility.
According to his own words, he enters politics to do good.
But Grandpa's entrance to the old man's training failed.
"I've never dreamed of little goals," he said at a press conference.
This means that my goal is to move the U.N. to move the mayor's move 20 percent in the elections.
Leckdo's in trouble.
My grandfather's objection is rather peculiar.
The billionaire Dalibor Grandpa is a man of strong opinions.
Although he is going to hear the voices of the voters in the old man's dress, he continues to support Andreje Babiš.
Grandfather, however, supported Granny in the last parliamentary elections.
"Babis is not a gunman and will not rule the popular rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote before the 2013 elections.
But it's definitely not politics because he wants to improve himself.
Granny's gonna be a hero to me.
He's willing to come out of his world under his control and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the elders introduced her as a new force, he confessed to his admiration for Babish again.
And he said he wanted the Elders to learn how to cooperate with Granny.
Some may feel that the Grandfather does not change his opinion and stands behind him no matter what dress he wears.
Others may wonder if Granny is sending to the Elders to build his bee like this.
Others may wonder if Jablotron's chief may not have broken up with Agrofert's chief in the business and is not looking for another way to defend his business rival.
Grandpa's first public performance wasn't just around Granny.
Grandpa promised to send the Elders ten million crowns to the campaign.
And if they need more money, they'll send more.
A few years ago, it would be hard for anyone to stop over a similar sentence.
The other court-recognised Gunner Zdeněk Bakala, before the 2010 elections, scattered millions to all sides.
The political division of the security agency Víta Bartya, TOP 09 and the citizens of the democrats thus came together at almost 30 million.
But today's a different time.
The law prohibits any political party from giving more than three million.
By the time Grandpa got into politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Maybe then you don't have to ask yourself why we have such a bad reputation.
His first days in politics, Grandpa then crowned the proposal for tax benefits for families with students.
People with high school education come to us every month for about 50,000.
I'll base you on a few 20s.
A man with fifty thousand is rich on the left.
The one with the 20 poor.
In Grandfather's vision, poor people pay taxes honestly and the rich enjoy the benefits of the functioning of a social state that they do not share.
The rich need short help not to be in trouble with the necessity.
The mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition, and Granny is holding her hands.
The rest of us, thanks to Grandpa, can confirm that billions of people aren't good people.
Then there's still a question to choose.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to keep them.
Those who do not have members and members of their party or citizens of the State for their employees and land for their property.
And finally, those who want to live well in a rich land for all people, not just some.
No one wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex had to cost 234 million.
The sale of real estate is sometimes not easy.
And sometimes he won't even help 11 beds, a beautiful sea view, or the fact that real estate sells US President Donald Trump.
At the sale of the Le Chateau des Palmiers villa complex, the price went down to 8 million pounds.
He briefed Mirror.co.uk about this website.
The brochure says, "Hello, Donald J. Trump."
Avoid the place like no other.
However, neither the association of the real society with the American president has defended the extreme price.
Donald Trump had to lower the price of his Caribbean seat by 8 million pounds.
The original real estate price was 21.5 million pounds, the final price fell to 13 million pounds.
Even after the discount, the villa complex stands about 76 average apartments in the centre of Prague.
And there's nothing to be surprised about.
St. Martin's 5 acre seat on the Caribbean island has 12 fully-fledged bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, strong and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
Part of the land is also a swimming pool and tennis court.
There are dozens of palm trees planted on the ground.
From the terrace is a beautiful view of the sea.
According to the real experts, the fact that the connection with the president is not enough to attract potential buyers was shown at the price.
Now real estate is closer to the usual prices of real estate on the island.
Trump bought real estate in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid about 15 million pounds.
The real estate was to be purchased for rent.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of St. Martin.
With a new price, they're going to second place.
The property in the neighborhood was valued at 13.5 billion pounds.
The NCAA decided to end up with two trainings a day.
The eleven-morning players of UCLA's American football are playing at the side of a new school playground.
Some of them take off their clothes and discover a sweaty back, an unmistakable sign of the first day of the training camp.
For most of the team members, these few minutes of non-work take the afternoon break.
The players of the summer semester will go to the rooms after three hours of training to study the final exams before returning to the Waterman Football Center for a meeting to be held in the morning at 6:30.
"These guys will be a real cat for the next three days," coach Bruins Jim Mora said just before he broke up on Tuesday.
By removing two exercises in one day, the NCAA wants to ease players - paradoxically, the training days are even longer - at least until Friday when the final tests are completed.
That's why the first three UCLA trainings are scheduled at 19:15 – to get into so many students' already broken diaries.
For the first time in six seasons that Mora spent in the position of coach in Westwood, the training camp Bruins starts a week before last year and the trainings are limited during the summer semester. It also has a decision to limit the number of trainings from two to one day.
A total of eighteen training sessions are scheduled until 20 August, beginning formal preparations for the first fight against the Texas A&M team in September.
It must have been heard that it supported the decision of the NSAA, although it added another item to the already so-called player diary.
"Three or four days are players under great stress and it is very exhausting for them," said Mora.
"But no one has given up, everyone is trying. They're great.
I think that on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down."
UCLA will be closed after the end of the training camp, which will not be easy in view of the clear line of surrounding land from the adjacent parking lot and the luxury hotel Luskin Center, which settled the players after the protection network was built by the branch.
The Bruins players should want to occupy this week, but Mora admits that when the rooms are empty during the season, there might be a problem.
"The land will be guarded by a security service," added Mora.
“Safety is taken care of, but it is not excluded that someone can rent a room and record our workouts.
It's a good deal with that kind of stuff.
Fortunately, the hotel will be looking after security, as well as parking lot No. 8.
We'll use our resources to the maximum.
I believe everything will work out.
It's all planned."
Facebook plans for more thorough control of facts to limit the number of false messages
Facebook will send more potentially false articles to control third parties and display findings under original contributions in an effort to fight the so-called fake news, the biggest social network said on Thursday.
In its statement on its website, the company writes that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes, which will send third parties to verify and potentially display the results of the survey under the original contributions.
Facebook has been identified as one of the main sources of false reports, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports have influenced the last election of the President of the United States.
In Europe, political debate is taking place on all matters. French voters are flooded with false reports of the May presidential elections, and Germany plans ahead of the September elections to put a stop to the social media network if it does not quickly remove the angry contributions.
Facebook said on Thursday in its next statement issued in Germany that it is going to launch testing the new function of checking false reports in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to displaying reports verified by third parties, people are asking for more content to be better informed and able to decide what they can share,” said Sara Su, the product manager of Facebook news.
She added that Facebook continues to test the "related articles" function and also works on other changes to reduce the number of false messages.
Construction of graphic novels: story of A Castle in England
The small castle of Scottney Castle recently played a leading role in the music video clip of the Squeeze group and its sanctuary was also found by Margaret Thatcher during the 70s and 80s of the last century.
However, Scottney was from his shelter at the Bewl River in British Kent, a 700-year-old stormy story that inspired the cobbled Jamie Rhodes from the York County, a famous landmark in historical documents, to create a graphic novel.
"A look at the letter of a man who is 300 years after my death fascinates me," says Rhodes with an important face.
"When I hold a letter, I feel a personal connection."
The graphic novel A Castle in England documents the lives of families who lived in the castle of Scottney from the Middle Ages to the Eduard period. Each story illustrates a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, this is not the first book of Rhodes's inspired archives: it is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection of inspired documents of the British Library - a project that was very emotional to him.
"He took my finger print on a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for the Jacobites," he said.
"It's his finger print!
And letters always smell like smoke, because in those days you had to light a candle to read.
When I get to the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
How I love archives!"
For someone who is so fascinated by old papers, the support of the National Trust and Arts Council England organization and the possibility of staying in the castle for almost four months as a dream.
Rhodes spent time studying the Victorian "new" castle, exploring archives and studying many treasures and curiosity, such as the head of hyenas on the wall and bottles that had been thrown after centuries in the countryside.
He walked through the land and examined the ruins of the old castle, spoke to the priests, the gardeners, and sometimes also the artists who worked on illustrations of his book.
On the night, he drank whiskey and wrote.
The confidential story of Scottney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust has gained access to documents until 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the employees began to penetrate the archives that Rhodes described, as if “the aristocrats of many centuries were spreading out with the words, ‘You're going to get under the roof’.
Diarys, letters from the time of the British Empire, maps depicting assets: “You may think the land dispute is boring,” said Rhodes, “but I struck one case when two families moved about.
Let the people go!"
Some stories in the book use the castle as a reflection bridge and wander deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, who follows a man who leaves a newly built castle to join the English uprising in 1381.
"I found a record of the revolt on the castle in 1380, which was called Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex," Rhodes said.
“The English uprising actually started in this area and I thought the rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe it's somehow related together."
The other stories are closely related to the history of the castle - for example, The Priest, who tells the story of the Jesuit priest, who hid Darrell's family after seven years during the English reform.
Or The Smuggler about an 18th-century pet named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled out the rocks (which was discovered up to a few years after the cancer was discovered).
Rhodes ’ favorite family are Darrell’s: “I was interested in men’s generation - those men were always indebted and wasted money for things they couldn’t afford.
The different generations of Darrell's family have solved this by taking rich or old dolls - I imagine they were the sights of the gentlemen, who were glamouring their heads with the heirs."
With the end of the stay at the castle, the Rhodes search after other adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week stadium in the Finnish wilderness, where he inspired his next book about Elämmenmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century, which was absorbed by nature.
But for Scottney, it's a special place.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I said to myself, 'Now to go back to real life.'
Washington changes the conditions for granting a green card
The media has published President Donald Trump's words about the new US immigration plan, which will also change when a green card is issued.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to fall by 50,000 per year as a result of stricter rules for the granting of temporary work visas and the restriction of family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and the President.
The bill will soon be presented to Congress.
“This law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars for taxpayers, and we aim to amend the rules for issuing green cards to residents of other countries.
The law limits the number of immigrants and replaces the current scheme.
A new application process is a priority English-speaking applicant who flows financial resources and demonstrates the skills that will benefit our country," said Trump, quoted by the media.
Sexual robots are on the rise - we should be watching
Just when it seemed that 2017 could not be more bizarre, a report on the technological development of sexual robots will appear on the Internet.
Yes.
Sexual robots are really popular at the moment.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a statement on the development of sexual robots within the next five to ten years.
According to former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and the co-founder of FRR Noel Sharkey, it is necessary to take seriously the rise of sexual robots.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the nipples and the look of the robot’s nails.
"People are hiding from them, but they are growing, and we need to be prepared to see them as much as possible," Sharkey said on the occasion of the release of the report.
Modern sexual aids are transformed from affluence you into a robot woman with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm to touch - of course artificial intelligence, which resembles human behavior.
The user can "adjust" the robot to his image - from the color of the eyes and shape of the nipples to the appearance and color of the nails.
It is very disturbing, however, that many robots have their own "personality", which would also embarrass the Stepford Miss.
Modern femurs developed into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set up a variety of character features, including shyness.
And then there's the sex robot woman Roxxy Gold from True Companion, which is delivered with pre-programmed personalities, including "Frigid Farrah", which is characterized by a shy character and "wild Wendy" with a "good-neighbourly" character.
"The character of Roxxxxy Gold is set in such a way that it expresses your personality as much as possible," says True Companion's website.
So he likes what you like and on the contrary.
She's even in charge, just like people.
It can be tired, phone calls or "in the mood".
The rise of sexual robots is alarming right now for several reasons - among which there is no exchange for real interspid relationships. Concerns are more of the inferior female character patterns and violent attacks - e.g. frigid (read offensive) Farrah.
True Companion on its website compares Roxxy to a male vibrator.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why couldn't a man have a Roxxy?" it says on the page.
However, sexual robots are not just fetishes or sexual aids.
Their origin and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deep rooted in our culture - a retreat from ideal or sexual equality towards the desire for undermanive sex with optional passion.
Most men understandably do not buy a robotic woman and while the FRR is talking about their growing popularity, sexual robots are still on the edge of the public interest.
However, this extreme interest can be a mirror of the present modern era.
And most people aren't weird or violent until they're trapped in a free market.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sexual robots appear at a time when women around the world are gaining their rights and sitting in the White House is the president, who is often very hypocritical at the address of women.
The most horrendous aspect of the Service Story series is not what we see - hanging bodies and veiled eyes, such as the reality of these visions.
The Book of the Story of the Servant represents a step in the right direction, but at the present time it seems to be a small step.
Sexual robots have as much like real women as possible (although with pornoher rates).
Their creators build them in such a way that they are pleasant to touch and act at first sight as a true woman.
However, when it comes to their "personality", the robot cannot replace the real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They don't have any work or history, anything that would cause them independence or break their loyalty to their master.
In other words, they're nice slaves.
He says 21st century: official.
The NBA star on the green light.
Curry's fighting in California about the corner.
The star basketball player Stephen Curry did not lose his first premier start among professional golfers in spite of the packed first fire.
Double winner for the most useless NBA player played the Ellie Mae Classic lower series Web.com Tour in California's Hayward first round for 74 rounds and will fight for a cut.
The Golden State player, who won the second title in the NBA with the Warriors team in this season, started very nervously and ended his first fire in the tank for a drink in a golf car parked at the fairway.
Even after that, he wasn't as accurate as under the basketball basket, yet behind him with a balance four wounds over the pair he left a dozen professionals.
"It wasn't the ideal way to start, I had to call the judge right after the first fire, but then I sat down a little," Curry said, saying that he was hit by a huge team.
It was very nervous to fire the first morning at the tournament, but it was all I hoped for.
"If you told me I'd play 74 in the first round, I'd take it right away," he added.
If Curry manages to fight with a cut that is likely to be two wounds under the pair, he will become the first representative of another sport that can do it on Web.com Tour.
"I want to play next better, and now that I've got rid of the times, it's probably going to go," said an enthusiastic golfer who has already played in the tournaments of celebrities and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
In Hayward, he starts the first time on a tournament that falls under the PGA.
To participate in Ellie Mae Classic he got a sponsorship exception and kept his amateur status.
Web.com Tour series is about one category under the elite PGA Tour.
The trump's big win?
By contrast, Mitt Romney is a healthy person.
A true sign of the Trump era is that there are political divisions that divide American voters, and in a micro-scale, they also destroy the entire family.
During the Christmas and Thanksgiving season, the American newspaper found it difficult to consult with relatives who prefer Trump.
Supposedly, we're just waiting for the nerves to let us.
However, less attention is paid to Trump's ability to suppress the family.
I'm talking about it because this week my cousin in New York, a poet and left-wing fan, who lived in Chicago and paid for a long time for the Republican fool in our family.
She reminded me that the face of the common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, all of a sudden the whole family - including all of the Republican relatives who have been away from politics for years - is on one wave.
At dinner at the family table it's a good thing; but it upsets me that in a broader context it poses a significant risk.
Trump reinforces the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to suppress all of us on the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the frightening possibility that his jokes may one day lose their attractiveness.
There is, however, an even more horrific long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the right-wing Republicans who, in opposition to his standards, will be surprised by what is called rational.
Today, with nostalgia in my heart, I remember Mitt Romney and his version of crazy behavior - the dog on the roof of the car, 14% tax on income (at least we were aware of his tax acknowledgement) - both of which look like a very mild break compared to Trump.
After Trump's departure, the next Republican candidate will be at least normal, which will be an immense improvement.
We took advantage of my sister's visits and took the children to Central Park for the biggest circuit that operates the New York Park department - for your three dollars you won't find a better use if you don't need caffeine.
Horses are huge, the middle warrior is covered with glolaminate - clowns and animals are filmed and in terror looks at their own shoulders - a completely cloudy view and zinc music of the shop recalls public transport.
Many clichés soon freeze: views from high buildings, panoramas look, instead of breathing on you the atmosphere and the reality of the city does not get your ideas.
About 50 years later, I still haven't moved through the fact that Swiss Cottage isn't actually Swiss cheese - it doesn't count on the theme owner Ye Old Swiss Cottage - but the metro station in London.
However, a stroller in Central Park is causing remarkable magical experience, to the point that he will have great fun for two-year-olds, as well as two mature women.
If I could score the round, he'd deserve a maximum of points, but no one's lucky.
This week, I experienced a similar experience in the store when I was asked to assess my "cash" on the scale from one to five when I paid the credit card.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street, it's the same thing, except that I can score 15% propitious for something I buy behind the desk.
Not only does it slow down otherwise fast sales, but the waiter is forced to dive into nice buyers when it's not necessary.
The woman in the store apologized with a smile when I reluctantly rated my credit card transfer with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to the hospital for chest pain
This is already the second thing Pistorius had to be transferred to the hospital.
Last year, he was treated for stabbing wounds on his wrist, which, according to the prison statement, caused him to fall into jail alone.
The Pistorius was convicted of murder after the appeal against the original order for the murder.
He killed his girlfriend Steinkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 with several gunshot wounds through the door of the toilet box in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed to have misdirected her with a thief.
The plaintiffs announced their intention of revoking, this time against the six-year punishment of Pistorius, which according to their words is too mild.
National Prosecuting Authority stated that it is referring to the South African Supreme Court and that the trial will be carried out this year.
In the event of success, Pistorius is threatened with extending the sentence to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in the South African Republic.
For the first time in history, she gave birth to a young man in a cage, a panda who was fighting in the wilderness.
It's a great success for the rescue program.
The Centre is trying to expand the genofund of pandas kept in custody.
Čang Č-chung's center worker told the agency of New China that the panda's breeding is at great risk of approaching the crossroads.
In fact, at the end of last year only 471 p.m.
They've only survived two thousand in the wild.
Trying to get caught up with those wild pandas is such a first step to help the breed panda protect this species.
The 15-year-old Cchao-cchao was released to the natural reserve at the beginning of the pairing period on 11 March.
Thanks to the monitoring device on the neck, scientists could observe every step of it.
She met her chosen Cchao-cchao 12 days later.
The sex relationship with the male panda lasted a minute and a half and it was successful.
Even this can be considered a small miracle, because the male pandas are not considered to be the most successful lovers of the animal kingdom.
Males are relatively poorly calculating the time when females are ready, and they are often confused and unaware of what to do.
The baby was born healthy and, given that Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, weighed 216 grams after birth.
The average weight of the newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists in Greece for illegal camping, the statement quoted bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were detained by the Estonian police on 1 August in early hours.
They were all released the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has indicated to the BTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules of free camping and have imposed severe penalties on anyone who is detained in a place where camping is not permitted.
Checks will be in the entire season.
The Ministry has stated that the court may impose a fine.
The arrow is on the first round of British Open in the 50th place.
Golfist Klara Spilk is the first major of the British Open in a 50th place.
The court in Scotland Kingsbarns scored one hit under the pair when she played three times the Birdy and twice the Bogey.
A twenty-two-year-old Czech player so hopes that the famous major will be heard for the first time.
The entry into the contest with a $3.25 million grant came out of the best American star Michelle Wieve, who won the first round in the 64th round, i.e. eight under pair.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are downloading millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands alone has temporarily closed 180 poultry cages due to the incident.
The Netherlands Food Safety Authority NVWA reported that it is investigating 20 per cent of all Dutch poultry, meaning that 80 per cent of the eggs on the market are inconvenient.
The Authority stressed that the risk represents only a limited number of egg types identified by specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the amount of toxic substances in eggs is small and does not pose a danger to adults, but a potential threat is to children.
Czech SVS spoke Petr Majer reported that eggs and chickens from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities also joined the closure of the herds, have not been transported to the Czech Republic lately.
However, veterinarians shall take target samples of eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, on whose markets the insecticide problem has arisen.
Eggs from Belgium were, according to the veterinary authorities, on the Czech market last April and eggs from the Netherlands last May.
The chicken meat from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of anti-inflammatory agents, all of them and clichés.
However, they must not be given to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The WHO World Health Organization considers it to be relatively toxic.
His high doses lead to a feeling of anxiety and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful. I'm gonna miss her. She says, "Sedláček" and she's looking for engagement.
I'd still like to catch ten years.
"Maybe I'll come back there once," the 27-year-old Sedláček, who could start the season in the lynching.
Depends on whether the engagement will take place before the start of the new anniversary.
What were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I were to evaluate it as in school, it would be three.
The first year I didn't catch too much, I had an experienced dick in front of me.
I've learned.
The second year I started catching.
Three years ago, I thought they were giving me more space.
But they brought in a new piece of shit I've been dealing with again.
Last year, I assumed I'd still be catching.
But during the opening ten games, we got only five points, so the coaches started to play it.
In the end, my colleague has caught more.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play it for the next season.
What was life like in Rize?
Beautiful.
It's little Prague.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm gonna miss him.
I found my girlfriend there.
We're together for the third year, next year we'll get married.
So I brought something.
How hard is KHL for the barber?
The first ten teams are really quality.
Then there are men like us or Slovan who have to change their game style against them.
Skills is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
It means playing more behind, fighting more.
I didn't see a problem in a wide field.
The difference is that the Russians want to play empty.
They're less shot, and even if they have a half-empty branch in front of them, they'd rather record.
There's only more shooting in the Czech Republic.
Didn't you have a problem travelling and moving over seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, it's not a problem.
He can sleep in peace.
The program is mostly done so you play four games outside and then you have two days off.
How does Lotyshi feel about their club in KHL?
Like a national team.
The whole of Latvia is watching hockey, together with basketball it's a national sport.
Fans all of them.
Even though it didn't work, there were a lot of people going.
Did the action of Dinam in KHL help Latvia to get to the quarter final at the world's championship this year?
KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And from the same time their results on the world championship began to go up.
At the 2014 Soči Olympics, they fell in the Canadian quarter final at just 1:2.
That was an unrealistic result for them.
Thanks to KHL, they got to a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech extraliga.
Roberts Bukarts settled in Zlina and Ralfs Freibergs is before the contract was signed.
What makes them come here so much?
They're not any bee players, they're really quality.
Here teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Lotys among them.
It's a natural direction.
KHL's starting in three weeks.
Why are you still unemployed?
By the beginning of February, I knew I wasn't going to continue in Rize.
This is where we started looking for something.
There was Sparta on the table.
But because they didn't have a budget for the shit, we didn't make a deal.
Then it was a classic.
We had a lot of fun with different teams, but they decided for someone else in the finals.
So I'm training at home in Zlina and I'll wait for something to come up.
Aren't you nervous about that?
That was four years ago when I left here and didn't know what would happen.
The current situation is not the best. On the other hand, I've been home for some time.
I caught something in KHL, so I'm taking it differently.
The question just sounds like when and where to sign.
How real is the option to have a new anniversary in Zlina?
The state can do anything.
We'll see what's going to happen in a month where everything's going to end.
Now I can just wait for the agent to arrange.
Do you prefer some competition?
The past season wasn't such that I could choose.
So I'm waiting on the phone.
Government flight to Flight continues.
In January of this year, I wrote about a camp in Letech near Orlík.
The substance of the problem remains the same, and so I will allow myself to recall the subject of the complaint.
They've been talking about camp in Letech for years.
For readers who don't know exactly what this is about, it'll probably be best if they look at the official cultural sites of the South City of Flight.
There, in the introduction of the historical survey, it is found that the camp stood two kilometers east of the town of Leta, that since 8.8. 1940 it served as a labor camp, from 1.1.1942 it was a gathering camp, and from 2.8.1942 it became a gypsy camp.
Another text describes the life span of the camp, including the conditions of the non-German camp, until March 1943, when the first years of the prison were included in the educational transport.
On 4.5.1943, 370 persons were transported by the largest transport to the freezing camp.
A total of 420 of them.
The very sad history of the immense losses of human beings that have caused them human beings again and utter ideologies.
There is no dispute about the need to keep these events in mind.
There is no doubt that this reminder should be played at a memorial place in the place of the suffering of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
Some time after socialism, camp was remembered, and in the 1970 ’ s, it was built in the vicinity and part of the former camp.
The history of the camp came to light in 1992 by American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a monument was discovered in Letech.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy and take off pork, but it hasn't happened yet.
In 1998, the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 it has been managed under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the United Nations Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close in spring.
So very briefly the facts of the camp's military fate.
When last winter the government approved the purchase of wheat and decided to draw up a price-fixing assessment.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, then the government will buy back.
According to Herman's Minister of Culture, "some numbers exist, but I'd probably dream of the intentions if I went to the public with them."
We'll see what the expert assessment will bring.
According to some informal estimates, it may be hundreds of millions, while others say the price may reach up to a billion.
So in no case will it be a cheap matter.
However, only a few hundred meters from the former camp stands a monument to which the state has invested nearly ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the whole transaction was beautifully funded by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is not likely to be a threat, it would, in my view, be a waste of money.
Is there no other government's priority?
The memorial, a dignified place in the south, stands at the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the ongoing tragedy and anyone who wants can bow down here to the memory of the suffering and the murdered.
I don't see any reason to change this!
Let's let it go the way it is, and let's keep the airport with maximum caution.
The person responsible, in this case, the Government of the Czech Republic, should deal with the care of the proper economic operator, whether the property is authorised or the taxpayer's money.
At least with a guy like that in his own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and Vice-President of the government are not the whole government.
But even so, from the point of view of the above facts, I consider the password of the leader of the UN just as an empty pre-election proclamation.
This year, in May, I went straight to the spot.
A very suitable arrival route, a modified parking lot, replicas of wooden camp barracks.
In one exposure, in another integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheatre with the possibility of sitting and with a view to its own airport, which is created from stones placed in a mild bond.
Lots of flowers and veneers.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place, how they are heard and belong.
Archaeological research is currently being carried out at the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether, for example, part of the discovered bases could not be stored and accessible visually at least in an appropriate manner.
This way, he could exert his efforts at the Minister of Culture Daniel Herman.
If he succeeds in prosecuting the purchase of pork for public money in the government, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already so problematic action as a minister of culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may alleviate symptoms of inflammatory stomach disease (IBD)
For your living system, red meat and dairy products may be a nightmare.
However, the new study suggests the opposite: food rich in animal protein and dairy products could help to reduce the symptoms of inflammatory stomach diseases.
An incurable disease affecting up to 1.3 million U.S. citizens and 300,000 patients in Britain causes abdominal pain and blood flow, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to use meat and milk products to relieve symptoms. However, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps create immune cells that support the resistance of the intestines.
Dr. Marco Colonna's study explained that immune cells protect the stomach and ensure the removal of harmful food microbes.
The number of active cells is balanced by the number of cells that support tolerances and protect the body without damaging the sensitive tissue.
As soon as the muscle weighs on the side of the inflammation, there may be an inflammatory bowel disease.
As part of the research, scientists have found the presence of immune cells supporting body tolerances in the stomach of mice with specific bacteria.
This bacteria requires the presence of tryptophan cells - one of the building blocks of proteins.
Professor Colonna said: “We have found a link between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a common component of the intestinal microbial and the development of cells that support body tolerances.
The more triptophans had mice in their diet, the more immune cells they had."
At the same time, he proposed that if it turns out that the same applies to humans, the combination of L. reuteri bacteria and food rich in tryptophan would help to develop a more tolerant and less aggressive intestinal environment.
The postgraduate researcher Dr. Luis Cervantes-Barraganwas found that one group of test mice had these cells as part of a study of a certain type of immune cells supporting body tolerance, while the other group of the same cells were lost.
It has been derived from the fact that one group of mice has different intestinal microbes - a society of bacteria, viruses and lungs that usually reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mouse gut was tested by a DNA sequence method, and researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells that had lost a second group of mice.
The mice, which were kept in the sterile environment and lacked gastrointestinal microbes, did not develop these types of immune cells - L. reuteri bacteria - and they created immune cells.
In order to understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers raised L. reuteri in fluid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells stored in isolation.
Immune cells developed into tolerant cells.
After the removal of the active substance from the liquid, it was shown that it was an adjuvant to tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-octic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mouse diet, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent. After the split dose of tryptophan also decreased by half the number of cells.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us store L. Reuters bacteria in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the subsequent products of tryptophan from the L. reuteri bacteria cause the development of cells in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in the genes associated with tryptophan have been detected in humans with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: “Each of us should probably try to develop these cells because they control the activity of the internal surface of the intestines.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri bacteria may increase the population of cells."
José Mourinho considers the signing of a contract with Nennji Matić and his transition to Manchester United as “genial”
Manchester United won a "genia" team in the form of Nemanja Matiće - at least José Mourin's thought after the hostage debuted in the middle match against Sampdoria.
Matić, who signed a contract for 40 million pounds, won the first 2:1 match in Dublin - the last pre-season match before UEFA Super Cup, where United meets with Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impressed on his role the hostage on the side of Paul Pogby and Andreas Pereira.
However, since he did not participate in the pre-season Asian tour team, Matić had no form and took only 45 minutes, according to Mourinha's words, to work before the beginning of the next Premier League season.
"It takes time, but it's experienced, intelligent and has a brilliant mind - thinking football," Mourin said.
"We'll help him get into the condition as soon as possible."
Like Matić, his new teammates Victor Lindelöf and Romel Lukak also played the first match at the Aviva Stadium and Mourin's slowly beginning to form his eleven for the next season.
An independent source this week announced that Mourin still wants to sign a contract with three other players, but it insists that the club has done "fiction work" and has brought into the team three of the four most important players.
"Thanks to the club for helping me get three of the four players," he added.
"Four of the four would have given me more pleasure, but I admit that they have done the maximum for me."
The life challenge of the king of chicken skins, Lady Hrushka.
He wants lessons from Pohlreich!
This multifaceted picture began to be painted thanks to a new series on TV Prima Zdeněkov Academy.
The Hound immediately blew up the chance.
"Dear Zdeněk, I would like to apply for this in your cooking academy, because I think I can learn a lot from you," he called him in a video on the social network.
And because the two of you have been snorting for a few years, Ladja hasn't forgotten him this time.
"In return, I can teach you sweaty meat from diet chicken, American chickens, or invite you to water and show you why your favorite cheese is fried," Hruška whispered.
His participation in the new show of Pohlreich is really serious.
It's time to move up the level and learn from the master.
"The question is what the boss is talking about," said Bleska.
But Pohlreich did not express himself because he filmed new parts of his next series Yes, boss!
Only Prima responded to Kruška's participation in the culinary academy by taking the whole thing as his personal activity that goes beyond television.
In December 2004, Hruška Pohlreich set up his first cook.
Over 300 thousand pieces were sold for a few days!
The new show that Prima presented yesterday at a press conference for the autumn broadcast scheme is an unfavorable cooking school.
Pohlreich picks his disciples from a number of audiences, and in twelve parts he is familiar with twelve cooking techniques.
In the last part of his show Now the chef cooks in November 2014 Zdeněk let his trick on the back of his shirt light up the cross.
If my face was there, I'd laugh a lot.
"On the top of that tortoise I just smile - the tortoise is healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins," Ladja responded.
She thinks of the Culinary Art of the Boat.
"To cook according to Lady Kruška doesn't come into consideration at home because I don't let my gastropunk at home," he says clearly.
I really appreciate Pohlreich's opinion, even he thinks I'm making chicken on honey.
In my order, however, his recipes certainly do not appear," Hruška refused.
He's an asshole!
He's not a cook for me, he's a television clown.
"Gastronomic illiteracy or stupidity," said Pohlreich about Hrushkov in one lecture.
"I'm not twenty to be able to shake my hand on them, but I don't solve them anymore either," said Kruška on the account of the alleged insults.
British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to pull off the car and the house with a hammer
The British inventor has become the first person in the country with a microchip put into the body. With a simple shake of his hand he can unlock the door from the house and office and even start the car.
Thirty-three-year-old Steven Northam had a small chip implanted between his finger and the indicator and currently offers the same service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives using technology.
Dr. Geoff Watson, anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, oversees the implantation and maintenance of medical procedures.
Technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted in dogs and cats and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam's company also offers a door and car exchange service compatible with a microchip. The price of one lock is £300.
The married father of one child let technology integrate into his home and his car the BMW Z4 brand, which starts with a simple handshake.
The White House's requisition was made by taxpayers of thousands of dollars
The White House's decision to fly with a Navy helicopter to South Lawn to celebrate the American manufacturing industry that took place last month came according to the Navy records issued by TIME weekly for $24,000.
The Green White Helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One in the presence of the President on board, was the top of the program on 17 July in the White House, which was a review of American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and several high officials of the White House watched the product review from all 50 states.
A helicopter from Connecticut was displayed next to the Maine yacht, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a spectacular lift from Mississippi.
The military officer of the White House issued a fragmentary order or FRAGO and requested the presence of a helicopter of 36 hours in advance of the landing of a helicopter on South Lawn within the "extraordinary" event, the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) records - units responsible for the administration of the helicopter.
"I wanted to make sure you were aware of this important event," said Commander HMX-1 in an e-mail to his superior, the commander of the Navy on the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn on 17 July at about 7:00 p.m. on the occasion of the inspection, the start of which is scheduled at 15:00 p.m. and will remain in place until the whole site was completely cleaned, which was planned between 18:00 and 21:00.
The e-mail further stated that if there is delay in departure from the White House, a replacement crew will be sent for return flights due to the Working Time Regulation.
The original crew stayed that evening together with the helicopter and a safety unit with them.
From the records - received by TIME weekly - it was not visible whether the second crew was finally sent.
The Hatch Act prohibits state officials from using government assets for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 investigates possible infringements of this Regulation.
"We were wondering if it was a breach of the Hatch Act and we were assured that everything was okay," the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you're being blocked," said the deputy commander.
This review “Made in America” was marked by the White House as an official event and Hatch Act would therefore not apply to it.
But official events also have political subtitles.
In his participation in the event, the President advocated a health reform that took place in the Senate and discussed an attempt to maintain the government regulation.
The use of aircraft, such as Marine One or Air Force One, for political purposes, is being hampered by the new phenomenon.
The presidents use them when traveling.
However, their presence is unusual for purely presentation reasons.
Trump ordered an inspection in February after the president's plane drove in the background at his first meeting in the Melbourne campaign in Florida. His Twitter account is charged with complaints about the use of his predecessor's presidential aircraft.
"The White House is pleased with the “Made in America”, which presented products from all the 50 states that make Americans from American materials," said the representative of the press secretary Lindsay Walters.
The HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landings in Washington and South Lawn and train possible arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump took part in the G-20 summit at the beginning of July in Germany, HMX-1 held 58 training sessions at the White House.
The flight to the inspection of Made and America was part of the current training of the crew, the state agent said.
On the same day, the helicopter unit ran for another eleven hours as part of the "unpresidency support missions".
The White House stated that no further claims were being made from taxpayers' money.
Speaker Sikorsky stated that the company was not interested in any way in the negotiations on the launch of a helicopter on South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep records of the budget for Presidential Flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact costs associated with the overhaul, as stated by the Navy.
According to the Ministry of Defence, the hourly price for the fiscal year 2017, DoD's VH-3D reimbursements are $24,380 per an hour.
The unit records specify 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of the helicopter move significantly below that amount.
"The introduction of tax fees on the basis of estimates for reimbursement of expenses is very misleading," Walters said to the whole thing.
‘These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in annual costs.’
According to the 2015 RAND study, DoD’s reimbursements do not include staff costs, but include fuel, maintenance and contractual costs.
The then White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter for the purpose of sightseeing.
"The idea of watching this week is to present products made in the USA," Spicer said.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and Connecticut state are very proud of the fact that they contribute to the defence of our state and that they provide work for hundreds, unless thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, we're proud of the helicopter and the other military facilities that are involved in the production of a large number of American citizens.
This fact should be recalled."
It's not clear if Trump was also looking at the helicopter at his raid on South Lawn.
Back in the White House Trump called the representative of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
"Sikorsky knows very well," said the president, "it's just three of its own."
A young woman tied up in the trunk at Mach's lake, the police came to her.
The girl went to the beach about the second hour of the morning on Sunday.
Instead of bathing, she remained trapped in the wetlands.
When she decided to use the phone to ask for police help, she had the last 12 percent of her battery.
"That's why the police soon lost contact with her," said police spokesman Ivan Balaková.
A few police officers came to the scene she described, but finding a young woman was not easy.
"Some of the policemen had to broach with racos wetlands hundreds of meters before they felt a solid land under their feet again," Balaková said.
And so was she.
The police were guided by what direction her call for help came from.
"In order not to come to this connection at least, they agreed with her that she would count out loud," the speaker said.
Police found a woman in three-quarters at five in the pools in Borný.
She was in a state of physical and mental strength and showed signs of cooling.
That's why she was transferred to a Chescolipe hospital by an infirmary.
Grandfather's connection to Stan?
The woman you're looking for becomes a saleswoman.
That's a little irony.
In his web project, searcheslusny.cz as a billionaire to the voters basically said that STAN suffers from the deficit of the right people.
And he also stated that a political party that is not interested in politics rather has less known concerns and independent ones, in fact, has no national programme for the election of photography.
Her election candidate just after the interview with Grandpa becomes a decent person, regardless of his political opinion.
That's how Vit Bart started, and it didn't work out very well.
In addition, Grandpa's favourite argument to the head of the STAN is that the greatest value of movement is the political verification and experience of the mayor's policy, traditionally the most popular policy, according to research.
Now they're quietly disposing of quickly collected unknown personalities.
The entire disunity with the people after which stan changed the logo and logo also explained that the Gazdík also did not want to lose his identity on the candidates.
But if the stan of the identity suspected only a few of them at the time, after Grandfather's arrival, he'll end up playing an identity game.
Not only did the Gazdík long set himself against the ANO Andreje Babi, on the first common press, but Grandpa, who publicly boasts, said: "My goal is to move the ANO, i.e. the Movement of the Old Age in the upcoming elections, twenty percent."
Let's hope he didn't make a mistake.
Grandpa is a successful businessman and a billionaire is certainly not a coincidence.
She often talks about politics like Granny, unlike him, but she does not build her own political mark.
STAN has for some time been recalling reality show rather than the real political side, and Grandpa's help hand as if she were a sales girl.
For some time, STAN went with TOP 09, then with the people, and now he's looking for decent people to change.
Let's hope someone answers.
Police dogs practiced in the Bridge overflight by helicopter
Dogs specializing in the search for explosives and patrol dogs practiced today at Lake Most overflight by helicopter.
The police dog must not be shy and afraid of flying, said the chief police cynologist Petr Tomášek.
Police dog training takes about two years.
At the Bridge, they practiced both adult dog training and those who just go through the training.
In addition to the standard training, in which they were to discover in the vicinity of the lake a sharp sample of explosives and find a lost figure, all 12 animals had to enter the helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of exercise is to test dogs in the helicopter.
So that as soon as the helicopter gets here, the dog can go to work so he doesn't have a problem with the helicopter.
"So far a helicopter, the dog goes and immediately searches," Tomášek said.
A dog who is restless or who is not able to start working right away is expelled from training.
"Most people then leave them with passwords such as in the garden," Tomášek added.
The police have 76 dogs with various specialties in the Ústecke region.
German Shepherds are dominated, but Belgian Shepherds are also coming.
The proverb about him guards from the dogs.
"He's raising him himself, preparing him for the service that the dog will do for us," Tomášek added.
Animals are subjected to repeated veterinary tests that may detect possible health handicaps.
If the dog is healthy and unwary, it will be the first test in 20 months.
"It's about two and a half years old," Tomášek added.
The length of police service depends on the dog's health.
Most of them serve up to eight to ten years.
Then they're living most of their scriptures.
Trailer for the 3rd Narcos season: Pablo Escobar is out of the game and Cali Cartel becomes the center of the Netflix hit series
Despite the conclusion of the second Narcos season, when the killer of Pablo Escobar is discovered, the Netflix series is not far off.
Confirmation by the Streaming Service has already taken place in the third and fourth seasons - firstly, the name has already taken place in the first trailer and the essence of other opposition figures.
In the third season, DEA focuses on the richest drug cartel in the world: Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of four influential peasants, they operate “like a Fortune 500 company”, except that they step up violent acts and pay more government agents.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) plays brain surgery, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is concerned about the connection with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) dominates New York.
In a new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, a figure of verbatim American and Colombian rights defenders in the fight against drugs.
Other actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishé and Arturo Castro.
The third Narcos season will wake up its premiere on 1 September.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
Elections may be valid only if all the members of the company, including women, are involved.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Assistant Mission, said that the elections to local representations were attended by hundreds of women, three women were held as Vice-President and more than 30 per cent of newly registered voters were women.
"The role of women cannot be overlooked," he said in his middle statement.
Elections may be fully representative and confidential only if they are attended by women, as well as all related processes that relate to elections.
The local and presidential elections in Afghanistan take place on 5 April.
The Taliban has issued a number of threats to the electoral process, which moves international combat activities on the other hand.
In the elections this year, for the first time ever, one democratically elected government surrenders its power to the next government in peace.
Haysom said that women's strong role is strengthening the democracy of Afghanistan.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission has stated that 1.2 million women make up of a total of 3.6 million registered voters.
A unique brewer cooks beer again.
For a good beer in a restored brewery.
The inspiration and honesty of the new owners returned a few years ago to the life of brewers in Lobči near Mšena.
The brewery mentioned for the first time in 1586 has the renaissance core and in the nineteenth century was converted into a paratrooper.
She followed the years of flowering when the beer was brewed mainly by dark beer.
Unfortunately, during World War II, production was halted and beer was born in 1984.
Since then, the buildings have served the state ship.
The damage was done by the brewers after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and demolished on construction materials.
In 2007, however, new hopes appeared in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Paul Prouzov.
They began to repair the buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
Carefully dedicated and dedicated study of archive materials, trying to preserve original materials and building elements.
The brewery has the same shape as it did in the nineteenth century, when its golden era began.
Their work was appreciated by the declaration of brewery as a cultural monument by the Ministry of Culture and the building also became part of the European tracks of industrial heritage.
In 2015, the tradition of cooking beer was also celebrated.
To taste the great lobe beer in the picturesque Kokořinska region, visit the brewery area.
In the cooking of beer, they use coconut water from protected landscapes, sweets from the lobe fields, and jazetic clouds.
In the extract, you taste the traditional light bed, but also dark beer and specials.
And don't let a tour of the brewery take place on Saturdays and Sundays at noon and at half past.
Czechoslovakia's biggest gunfight?
One of the biggest strengths of his type on a global scale?
This unique building was meant to be the fortress between Trutnov and Jacler, at the top of the field grave over the village of Babí.
It was originally supposed to be made up of up to twelve bunkers connected with vast underground.
There were to be the headquarters, the matrimonial office, the ammunition, the materials, the power station, the machinery and the hospitals.
But the construction was completed by the Munich Agreement.
A few years later, he was able to build the only powerful iron bunker and the underground space was demolished.
Thanks to the fans of the Stachelberg Spolka, who began to rebuild the unique building in the early 1990s, you can also look here.
The ground floor is already 75 percent available!
A part of the area is besides a foot-and-mouthed T-S 73 with an exposure and a ground and armed object of light fixation, besides two loose foot-and-mouthed screws, burials and a scientific path secured by Trutnovsko.
Refreshment, shelter and fascinating views to the countryside guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building has been listed next to such monuments as the Great Chinese Wall, Traian's port at Rome or the Assyrian palace in Nineveh and Nimrud.
The Château of Chotéšov originally from the beginning of the 13th century, which today is mainly a four-story building of a beautiful garden.
The list he got on, but unfortunately it belongs to the unique buildings that threatens to burn.
But the audiences do not want to give up, and they organize a lot of action to support the monastery.
One of them is another year's dinner for the monastery of Chotéš this Saturday, August, where Ms. Vladimir Mišik, Ivan Hlas, will perform, you will see the shermir performance and you will see the places of beautiful extensive buildings that are usually not accessible.
But mostly you enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.

Identify the plant with one click.
Students with teamaking and ordinary lovers of plants will be helped by a new free application Pl@ntNet.
If they're interested in what plant they just hit on the walkway, this app will help them.
The only thing they'll have to do is take a picture of the plant and the application itself recognizes what kind of plant it is.
The new app, which is available for iOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday by representatives of the Centre for Ethics and Environmental Education CEEV in Bratislava Mountain Park under the Project The City's Secret Life.
The project also involved students from 50 Czech and Slovenian schools who photographed and added plants from their surroundings with teachers in the application database.
The newly created French app is free to download on the pages The City's Secret Life.
The main objective of the French programmers was to contribute as much as possible to the application of their images, thereby increasing the number of plants that the application can identify.
"Children who already have a tablet or a cell phone in their hands can go into the woods," said the coordinator of the project Ivana Poláčová.
Based on enough quality photo of the flower, leaf or fruit of the plant, the application can recognise its name within a few seconds, which will then be added to the photograph in Czech and Slovenian.
French to us The secret life of the city allowed us to translate the application into Slovenian and Czech.
It is therefore welcome for users to contribute to the plant image that is not yet available in the database after the start of the application account.
"François will assess whether it is beneficial and then add it to the database," Polácová said.
GMB concerns about investment in McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The committees require insurance from the manufacturers of McVitie's dryers for a long-term production commitment in the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish Association of the GMB stated that the company was currently silent about any investment in the Tollcross factory.
More than 500 employees are working at the factory, who manufacture products and hobnob and Rich Tea dryers.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, stated that over the past few years, she invested more than 5 million pounds in the whole area.
She added that the staff and representatives of the committees would be “among the first informed” in the event of changes in the operation of the factory.
In a letter to the construction company, the Scottish GMB committees expressed their concern that McVitie's "will not be able to meet its commitments to finance and modernise production lines".
GMB chief organizer Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we have not received clear answers from the building manager regarding the needs of the company and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very worrying for our members.
Many families have worked here for generations, and employees come from the local community and Glasgow, where work in this factory is a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social exclusion.
In terms of work, wages and benefits - and despite Brexit's outlook, rising life costs and decreasing slow production - the eastern part of Glasgow needs a prosperous producer such as McVitie's."
Pladis said: “The building manager Tollcross received a letter from the GMB only yesterday, and the company issues a statement as soon as possible, as we appreciate our continuing commitment to the employees and representatives of the committees.
A regular meeting with GMB staff and representatives in Tollcross took place two months ago and many problems were openly discussed at this meeting.
We spoke to employees that, as in all companies operating under extremely competitive and unrealistic economic conditions, we will evaluate our operations on a regular basis, which is valid for all our operations so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested 5 million pounds in the Tollcross area, especially in manufacturing lines and in efficient operation.
We highly appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and the localities and, in any event, the employees and representatives of the committees will be immediately informed of any changes in the operation of the factory."
Did the PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's move three years ago?
La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain does not allow Neymara to get on his side after having paid £ 189 million, which means the amount required to buy Neymara out of the contract, but warned this French team of Barcelona about its record ride three years ago?
This sensational transition has unfolded the waters of summer transitions. Club Lige 1 is ready to overcome more than twice the previous record amount for Paul Pogby's transition to Manchester United, which paid him 89 million £ in last season.
After confirmation and completion of the transfer, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and at the same time the best paid professional athlete in the world - after tax he will collect more than £500,000 per week from the PSG team.
Barcelona is upset by the way Neymar broke out of his contract, despite the fact that the confidential source confirmed that the club has always tried to rescue Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
However, was the football world alerted to this reality three years ago by the President of the PSG?
When Manchester City in 2014 expressed its interest in Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Kheleaif warned all the clubs that would be interested in taking over one of the best PSG players.
"I'm not afraid, because once someone tries to get one of our players, then we'll definitely call one of their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players, they will face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed the concordance when in summer she expressed an interest in PSG Mark Verratti's depositary.
PSG made it clear in the sense that under no circumstances would allow the departure of the Italian representative. It is therefore possible that Barcelona will now swallow a bitter pill for its trophical conversation with Neymara.
Who's gonna explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have broad-based rules?
Donald Trump was on the run for anti-Russian sanctions.
The United States imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Madura the day before.
And the day before, Trump wrote that China is not doing anything with a North Korean threat and that it will not go on.
And from that, it clears the idea of sanctions like a shoe break.
You can't throw those things in one bag.
Maduro Venezuela really went on her way to the dictatorship, but totally.
China just doesn't act the way the American president wants it.
The Russian chapter is for itself.
But if anyone wanted to sum it up in such a way that even the ordinary will, American, European or other, understood what it is based on and which system of rules is based on sanctions policy, it would be almost impossible.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump is only concerned with what President Obama has already done, just gave him the executive stamp.
So why is it so dissatisfaction?
Last year, Europe was afraid that if we win the American Trump election, we'll be hanging out with Putin and withdraw the sanctions.
That's a terrible idea.
In practice, it's the wrong thing.
With Trump, sanctions are not released, but they're confirmed.
But Europe is even more afraid.
German Prime Minister Zypries says Trump's sanctions violate international law.
Like the basketball is just sanctions approved by the United Nations Security Council?
Then there are no EU anti-Russia sanctions.
The head of the European Commission Juncker once again complains that Trump's sanctions are threatening EU energy security.
It's like they're supposed to use sanctions just so weak that they don't threaten anyone?
The usual choice of tape.
For three years he heard that the verdict of anti-Russia sanctions depended only on the implementation of the Mine Peace Agreements in Ukraine.
It is now known that it is EU energy security.
A lot of tape and a lot more.
There are sanctions on Russia for mounting too much where it doesn't exist.
China is obnoxious because it's getting a little mounted.
The Venezuelan President is punished for building a dictatorship in his country's borders.
All these penalties or just considerations have their rationality.
But does anyone see the system, the rules or the rules?
Andrej Babiš: I do not consider cooperation with Okamura.
Andrej Babish married, crosses the Republic with his visionary book and finalizes the election program.
Apart from the Pardubian region, all candidates are ready.
According to his words, he had no significant influence on them.
He even agreed to lead the heitman and shadow minister of ANO Ivo Vondrak in Moravian.
"If he succeeds, however, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a Member or a Heitman," said his previous opinion.
A lot of representatives and nationwide politicians have been angry at your view that the election of mayors and mayors should be conducted by the locals and cities themselves, with only managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we are directly elected president and I am convinced that we should also elect mayors and prime ministers.
In my book, I'm not talking about disrupting representatives, they can be there quietly.
The question is how many will be there.
When I presented your book about what I was dreaming about, I heard in my own ears that you were talking about abolishing representations.
I don't remember that.
I was talking about direct choice and reduction in the number of representatives.
New York with nine million inhabitants has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague with 1.2 million citizens has 1171 representatives.
And the prime minister is expected to build little and not make big projects, but she doesn't have the power to do it.
The same applies to the government that only two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
Which I'm not saying they did well.
The current prime minister, however, has nothing to do with it. He's just slowing down the debate.
That's how it can't work.
That's why you want to set up a majority system?
He'd be perfect, but it's hard to bet.
There's only a change in the program to a one-wheel election to the Senate.
We have also proposed a clumsy mandate for ministers and the regulation of the Rules of Procedure of the House in order to prevent the excessive exhibition of Members who are to work mainly in committees and committees from taking place in the Houses.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents are afraid of.
That as a dictator you will run the government, control the camera with 101 MPs, destroy the countries and the Senate, and by means of grateful concerns and primacy you will rule the entire country.
I'm sure it's not.
There is nothing wrong with discussing the number of Members.
French President Macron has announced a reduction in the legislative body of the third, while there are 57,000 French lawmakers there, while we have 17 thousand Czechs.
However, the macrono one blames for the threat of democracy.
Even if someone in the Czech Republic won most elections, we have mechanisms that would prevent him from making any dramatic changes.
The consequences for those who have a parliamentary majority are big enough to look at Poland or Hungary.
Nothing like that in the case of the U.N.A. is at risk.
We just need a team that will work in the government for people, not for their parties or resorts.
I don't understand why we couldn't agree that there's only going to be an increase in the salaries of teachers, employees in culture and social services.
Why have I been voted in and added 21 percent to the GIBS members who are already taking 60,000?
Would you like to do that as a prime minister?
The prime minister is supposed to be affected when ministers behave uneconomically, messing with government with travel offices, and for the money of the state they would like to run like Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
The ministers in the government don't argue, they're supposed to argue outside.
The cabinet has to go with the finished material, where there's no room for coalition cracks, force voting and gossip, there's gotta be a decision.
How do you want to have a coherent team when ministers are mostly partying?
There's a constitutional law on the sides.
When the bread was breaking, Saturday said the coalition agreement was not paid, and Grandma left the government.
Any prime minister can do that.
But if he's a person and he has management skills, he doesn't need a similar plan gesture.
It measures everything the same and requires perfect performance from all.
Do you know who you would propose to the Minister of Finance?
I don't even think about it, because we're not even in that government, and nobody wants to cooperate with us, even though I don't know what I've done so terrible.
There's not so much sepsis in place.
The mayors have won the Grandfather's business, who would like to cooperate with you, may win the wing of your beloved Jiri Chunk.
I don't think so.
ČSSD leads Lubomír Zaorálek, which does not exclude the U.N. Coalition, may be located in the ODS Václav Klaus ml., which will also not oppose.
I'd leave it on the voters.
Deputy Prime Minister and Vice President of the United Nations Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with SPD Tommy Okamura, for example in the field of economics.
So the ocamuracians come to be considered as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec claims he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, he's running for VV as a Vita Bart for VV, then he's got his company's money from the Uzvita, and he's been there for a while.
He is, of course, an outstanding person.
But it's kind of disgusting.
When I take his program, there's a wide involvement of people in the management of society, direct democracy, that's what we can agree with.
I'm not asking you that at all.
I wonder if you are an acceptable person who has xenophobic opinions speaking in demonstrations with matches and wants to get out of the EU?
We don't consider cooperation with Mr. Okamura, I can't imagine.
Clearly, he went to politics to benefit from it.
What about the silent support of the communists of your minority government?
I can't even imagine it, but the voters will decide.
It's about negotiating a win with another in order, but God knows who the winner is and who the two are.
Of course, it is important for them to be able to agree on a coalition government program.
Let's go back to your attempt to become a company.
But the government just has to drive, Prime Minister Sobotka has let everything go, never decided.
Coalition matters such as CEB or EGAP did not function.
Because Saturday is his doll, and I think that was also why he threw me off.
As soon as he did, CEZ ruled the Czech government.
However, it is incredible that the prime minister has brought a resolution written by the ČEZ management, which saves the Minister of Finance, how to vote on the ČEZ rolling stock.
If you become a prime minister, will you change your personal relationships in the Supervisory Board and exchange top management ČEZ?
Jesus, if I'm a prime minister, he'll see you.
I'm not yet.
It sounds like ČEZ has already sent signals in your direction.
Good cooperation with the ČSSD would like to exchange for even better cooperation with the UN.
Well, maybe after the election, everything will go on.
I don't know anything about that.
I don't have a Humor or Pink lobbyist, I'm a single unit, and I don't even solve this.
Then respond directly.
If you are in charge of the government, will you try to exchange ČEZ, Czech Television or General Health Insurance, or institutions that you are criticizing?
I'd like ČEZ to be a transparent company.
So far, he's been doing what he wanted for years, and thanks to the traditional political parties.
It's enough to look into Mr Schwarzenberg's verdicts.
Although he was supposed to be in the ČEZ majority, he never drove him, he was only there, which is wrong.
It's a trivial matter for me.
ČEZ is to take Dukovany, assess them, transfer them to a subsidiary, arrange financing, make a supply competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The concept that the state should finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
What about Czech TV?
Some of her shows against me lead a permanent target campaign, but I don't have and I won't have any powers to throw anyone out.
But control yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens are paying about 7.2 billion a year for public advertising and pay television, but they don't really know how these institutions operate.
How come they don't know?
However, the House approves the report on their economy, which has a direct impact on the position of the Directors-General of the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic.
Look how those reports are being handled, about that super powerful pact Sobotka Kalousek, which always worked.
It applies both to the present parliamentary committee for the escapes from the investigation files and to lex Babish.
And Saturday was so stupid that he let Kalauske push me out of the government, which earned a percentage of TOP 09, but the ČSSD took them off.
They are afraid of violating their corrupt system, and so they are talking about the threat of democracy to Babish.
Nobody's immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how the first Vice-President of the UN Jaroslav Faltýnek builds a power base by reaching the son of the Board of Supervisors Tepláren Brno and equips his associate lawyer Kvetoslav Hlín's contract with city and state companies such as the Prague Transport Company or the Czech Roads?
There's a permanent dispute.
I don't like it, and I've counted it several times.
Faltýnek argues that the said lawyer works at a significantly lower rate and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As a finance minister, I didn't have anyone.
We were, unlike the Socans, never had a corrupt affair, no Pelt, no Kratosy, Brezin.
If there was any sign of clientelism in us, we just threw out that person.
In this direction, I am uncompromising.
If something like that happens, we get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it is.
