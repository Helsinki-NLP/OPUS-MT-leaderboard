White pawn at f3, black pawn at e6, white pawn at g4, black lady at h4 - failure and matt! This is what we call in the circles of chess the "mad mat".
Whites: round on a1, pawn on b6, king on c8. Blacks: pawns on a7 and b7, king on a8, crazy on b8. Whites put the opponent in zugzwang by playing the turn on a6, after which the blacks have only two options: take the turn on a6 or move their crazy to any other case of the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, the whites advance their pawns from b6 to b7 and offer failure and matt. In the second situation, the whites take the black pawn on a7, with the same result.
