It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her old father.
How do they treat you?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped worrying.
Do we have to help her?
Tom promised to help.
It's empty.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
That'll take some time.
Why don't you go get him?
That's one of mine.
You look like you're studying.
I'm walking.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Did I call you?
Do you like the wheel?
He's a bread lover.
I feel like a fool.
Tom didn't give me enough help.
I'm not gonna use Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean to him?
Tom told Mary he was happy.
Only once we've met.
Thank you for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's give them up.
What's it worth?
Our water was to the gust.
Tom pretended he didn't notice Mary was watching him.
What do you usually do on Monday?
Tom stopped walking back and forth.
Tom raised the flag.
Do you believe me, Tom?
Tom's not my dad.
Tom's my neighbor.
Tom's already gone.
He's probably still got it.
It looked beautiful.
We were in a hurry.
What is this?
Nobody knows this.
The drain was jammed.
Breakfast's from seven to nine.
Tom came back last week.
They were all scared.
I've been watching so far.
You made a good choice.
Nudists consider the nudists to be normal.
We sat there and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
They kidnapped me.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he doesn't know anything about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good woman.
Dan shared his racist views in public.
Do you know who I'm talking about?
That's mine.
The wolves took care of the flock.
That song has haunted me for years.
I'm working.
We'll be there.
Did Tom pay the rent?
This gentleman is my acquaintance.
You're not right, people.
Tom was productive.
The racists are fools.
Are you happy, Tom?
You shot with a gun so far?
I really like that tattoo.
You got a card for your pocket.
I don't want to turn myself in to the police.
You're mad at me, I can know.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you later?
I feel lonely in this town.
What have they been doing so far?
Tom's homeless.
I don't live in Boston.
They sued the government for the damage.
No one trusts Tom.
The clock had a warranty.
How about we meet tomorrow?
I should have known you were gonna be here.
When did the robbery happen?
Did you ask Tom why?
Tom heard his phone call.
Tom was doing as Mary had told him.
Show us where you found him.
I thought I'd never find him.
The competition for that job is big.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom is aware that he wasn't a good father, so he's trying to make up for it.
Tom can't pretend.
Tom said he wanted me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom looked down.
I love honey.
I have to admit something.
He was influenced by alcohol.
Dan decided to leave town.
You don't know anything.
Tom looked around.
They're pretty safe.
Tom's got a bit of a fall in his cheeks.
Nobody cares.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I would have answered negatively.
I have to help him.
He's criticizing himself.
You'll understand when it's time.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom broke the mastic.
I really love your older sister.
Can you make sure Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go to a picnic with John.
Don't be silly with me.
I think you did it.
We didn't come from the monkeys, but we have a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
When do you usually have lunch?
I consulted with him.
Have you ever thought about giving up?
It's been going on all night.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too big for me.
I'll do it if you don't mind.
Tom's right.
You're kind of rude.
Sounds like Tom.
Nobody's judging you.
Stop denouncing Tom.
What could go wrong?
When do I get to Boston?
Tom was having breakfast later.
Are you helping?
Are you two relatives?
He wants ham with eggs.
Just put it on my account.
I'd rather take a subway than a train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle that?
Tom's obviously an asshole.
I'll send you my bill.
I'm fat.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Should we call them?
Tom will be ready.
But I like it here.
Did he give up?
Mary wrapped up the movie.
She's got a nice handwriting.
Tom knew why Mary hit John.
I wrote this report to Tom.
Is this what they buy?
It doesn't look very good.
Hey, can you give me that back?
That was personal.
I better go, too.
Excuse me for a moment.
Take off your hat.
Acting is very good.
Please don't mumble.
Last night I saw a ghost.
I'm in London.
I'm not gonna be alone here.
He asked me to look at him.
We'd better not get out of this storm.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Do we really eat pizza so early in the morning?
Can you come back?
Tom and Mary spoke French.
He's gone.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't even know Tom and Mary had been married before.
Do you want to sing?
You're lucky.
My nose runs out every time I'm tired.
We've met several times.
Nobody likes the soup.
The tree's green.
The moon's surface is wrong.
I'm trying to explain this to you in a way that you'll understand.
Everyone's looking for luck.
Did someone else come into the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something in it.
Tom treated me terriblely in high school.
Tom was wearing a hat that was still at the price.
Tom promised to help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really love Tom, do you?
There's got to be a difference.
The ring is cursed.
We need to call for help.
That's what you wrote in the paper.
Tom said it was urgent.
I'd agree with that.
Tom would lend you money if you asked him.
Tom was obedient, even submissive.
Where did Tom open?
Mike said he'd come.
I'm just having a little fun.
I wanted to call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're humans.
You don't make a man with a helmet.
She tried herself.
Run!
Is he paying for the delivery?
I want a rep.
Why are we meeting here?
The glass breaks easily.
Tom's bed is empty.
He's got a weak heart.
Did you buy them for me?
You haven't seen one like that, have you?
You'll never guess.
I think I'll be all right.
The mosquitoes carry malaria.
You've been delaying this for too long.
I don't understand.
That's too bad.
Let me tell you something else.
What about you and him?
Whatever you do, hurry up.
I think I know how to find him.
We're taking checks.
The newspaper costs one dollar.
How did that get up there?
Tom drinks a lot of water.
There were eyewitnesses.
You hit one.
Macedonia has four Google ways: declared, conditional, ordered and transmitted.
They haven't left yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The peaceful surface reflected her drawings as a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom laughed.
Tom's not very happy.
Can I talk to you, Tom?
These pants are right.
I don't have a gun.
I need permission.
We're the champions.
You scared Tom.
That's exactly what it is.
Shouldn't we help him?
Don't throw garbage on the ground.
I remember how I met the queen.
Tom's really rich.
I had to pay in cash.
Tom's a martyr now.
Tom seemed angry.
What Japanese economy will be next year?
That's how I got into trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
How come you don't sleep?
They're giving me advice.
Tom started screaming.
This tooth needs a bullet.
I have to think about myself.
I was trying to find him.
Our court is big.
It's a children's game.
Tom, don't be mad.
I'll be back in six and a half.
Tom took me to my mother's pussy.
I wasn't just an hour away.
I'd be happy to help.
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
The play must go on.
Make a good stand scandal.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did you have to?
Don't attract attention.
I almost fainted.
Pick your favorite stick.
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
We're running out of gas.
Tom's a tramp.
Who do you have on the list?
He's got a lot of alibi.
Look in the mirror, brother.
Let me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Should we wait here?
And the girl saw that.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you took Mary's flowers?
What don't you like?
Let's see what we're dealing with.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't want ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
May I go with you?
Tom looks pretty sleepy.
Tom's spending a lot.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things Tom's been complaining about is food.
Make sure you don't get stuck in the muddy bar.
They're both coughing.
The train went through a tunnel.
Tom's too sensitive.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
We didn't wait for them.
Are the meals included in the price?
That would follow.
Do you want a tennis?
It'll be all right.
Sauna's here.
She can't be.
Today is the day that they will try to escape.
Everybody's gone crazy.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom knows Mary from the garden.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer is still confirmed.
I'm here to look for her.
It's all wrong.
Why do you work for them?
Your future begins today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good show.
Tom's already been questioned by the police.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still don't believe Tom's gone.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Maybe Tom's playing chess with Mary right now.
Looks like you're right.
Don't talk about her.
How strange!
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Tom's got a Russian room.
No survivors.
She was supposed to shut up.
I'm not like you!
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
They're laughing quietly.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I got him a skank.
Tom's not alone.
Tom needs to take a shower.
Take Tom with you.
It happened before.
Who's the loser?
That'll do the job.
Tom didn't answer.
Moral values are important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were more than a hundred people at the party.
This will make you happy.
The king was particularly tired of speaking because of a serious speech flaw.
She didn't accept the invitation.
Tom seemed surprised when I told him Mary wasn't here.
This bag is too heavy.
The weather forecast is defective.
Don't look so upset.
The rebels tried vainly to submerge the submarine.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
It's easier not to end up in prison than to escape.
He's getting close.
When do you learn?
It was hard for Tom to swallow his pills.
It's worth quoting a well-known passage of his essay.
Tom's making Mary happy.
Tom's reckless.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by men.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't look busy.
We'll catch up on it right now.
Didn't you hear me call?
Go for a walk.
Don't overeat.
Just ask them to give it back to you.
Pull out the pen.
I don't have plans for tomorrow.
Tom went ahead to listen.
Why don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep his promise.
So you didn't want the prize?
Watch the demon.
I'm glad you're happy.
Don't be honest.
Why can't you go now?
You will learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
Look at the star that shines.
I don't know how to help him.
Tie it up.
Make him admit it!
None of them know.
She likes short skirts.
Can you explain why?
You can stay in here.
Shut up, Albert, your theory is stupid.
We've been bankrupting.
Everybody knows you hit Tom.
Can't you at least help me?
I like this school.
Call me if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the light.
When do you need to renew your passport?
Mary has no courage to face Tom directly.
My son is not a snob.
It's from Tom.
There's no line height in his story.
The battle was short.
I'm so retarded!
We discussed this.
Tom caught the ball.
Where's the nearest club?
Let them call me.
The power grid heats the ceramic tiles from the bathroom floor.
Tom helped Mary.
I know you'll give me back when you have the money.
Dan came to visit us yesterday.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This task requires skill.
Are you happy to help them?
I'm sick of this war.
In the woods, monkeys came down from the bushes.
Let's forget about it for now.
Because of his father’s sudden death, he gave up his plans to live abroad.
You're getting the data fast.
You can't give up.
Didn't you get it?
Hello, ladies.
I'll sum it up.
I don't know.
At first I couldn't stand it.
He's stuck in his sleeve.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know yet.
I'll stay here and help him.
Quiet!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he wasn't cold.
We're trying to help him.
Everyone left but him.
Tom's here to protect me.
I didn't know you were playing chess.
It's getting dark.
The pipes are closed.
I offended you, didn't I?
Tom can't drive.
You can't control me, Tom.
Don't die.
She's stuck next to him.
Tom's not a vegetarian.
I think he's right.
We slept in a tent.
The kids cry again.
Tom didn't do what he asked.
Tom mistakenly told everyone that I was dead.
I think we found one.
The deadline for the reports is next Monday.
My baby wants to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I was beautiful.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I thoroughly investigated the situation.
Tom's just an ordinary man.
The dog's name is Ken.
I'm the one who'll help her, not you.
Most whales feed on plankton.
We need to get out of here right now.
I'm ready to do that.
The water came to my knees.
Let's make the cake.
You need to help me find him.
I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm the crazy one.
Unfortunately, you're gonna have to release Tom.
Shame!
Don't get so excited.
Silvia really liked the concerts.
Invite them to join us.
Where do I park?
Does anyone care?
How do you feel about that?
Tom beer from the bottle of wine.
I fell off the wheel.
Come in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in this book?
Do you mind?
When does this start?
She sounds disappointed.
Tom's socks are broken.
Tom told Mary to donate money.
I have it with me.
Didn't your name be Cookie the old dog?
I just bought a boat.
But he's been cheating on her.
I'm not married yet.
Is the lake deep?
Tom's my assistant.
I suggested it.
You're weak.
Tom started laughing.
This is Tom's school.
I don't feel very good today!
Tom didn't approve of the plan.
After I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with that.
Did you ask her for money?
Hold him!
We need to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It's a multi-phase process.
I have a little gift for him.
This is my plan.
You're talking too much about Boston.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
Tom's not shy at all.
Tom runs down the valley.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
Senf's really hot.
We're advertising our products on TV.
I was kind.
Tom was a good man.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
I had a few auditions, but I didn't get a job.
That happened almost 30 years ago.
Tom's too old to live alone.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try to do that before.
You were a great mentor to me.
Tom listened to me.
I have to find a way to help them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Do you have a pen?
Tom's my age.
Gold weighs more than iron.
He hit me in the head.
Is there anyone in there?
Have you read this?
What if they say no?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom would panic.
Tom was 30 years old.
She's gonna have to go.
You should try this.
I expect a call from them.
They've blocked it.
Tom's struggling.
Tom developed the map.
What's that smell?
Anyway, he didn't get what he was hoping for.
I just fired them.
This was fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it that obvious?
Tom really needs help.
You have to stay as far away from him as possible.
Tom would understand.
We were laughing at Tom.
Didn't you know Tom was gay?
Tom found me a job.
I knew it was real.
Is that enough?
Tom, put your hands out.
There's nothing you and I wouldn't do.
He says the previous dentist told him he'd remove the fibers from his nicotine if he stopped smoking.
Don't expect everyone to share your thoughts.
That's exactly what Tom suggested.
I kind of feel wrong.
Tom's a smart guy.
Carita's right is a mixture of more spices.
Yes, my angel.
Tom heard everything they said.
It was a hard night for me.
Tom was driving through town with a high brake without notice.
Yeah, anyway.
Do you want a camp?
Who broke the bowl?
Who's gonna be there?
We didn't want to turn Mary out of the plan.
Are you planning on sitting here for a long time?
She teaches English to advanced students.
Tom seems suspicious.
Keep it to yourself.
Now you do, don't you?
I'm pretty excited.
I'm not employed.
My old English teacher must be turning into a grave now.
People often complain about how others treat them unfairly, and they do not view their own behavior as undesirable.
He wears high heels to make himself taller.
You want some bowling?
I'm sorry. I think you've dropped something.
All you need to do is talk to Tom.
I'm right.
I've been robbed three times this month.
Can I come?
Do you need a break?
I want to practice.
Tom owns a blue car.
Don't shout.
I'm here with Tom.
Tom was completely humiliated.
Don't call me an asshole.
And what does it have to do with it?
We're finally seeing each other, Tom.
I bought him that book.
This house isn't big enough for our family.
You gave up on the idea.
I'm sure I sound funny.
It's nice and fresh.
Tom was celebrating.
What's going on?
Did someone hit Tom?
We have a rule here.
Tom made up his mind.
Tom won't be very effective.
The day was so beautiful that we decided to climb.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom used indignant expressions.
Your coffee's in your power!
Tom was a nice man.
It's a big mercenary for football.
Why did you ask me about that?
I thought he was there.
Did you feed the dog?
Sometimes I'm afraid of darkness.
We're gonna miss you, Tom.
Tom works in NASA.
Tom's writing.
Something very similar happened to me!
I'll make sure Tom writes his homework.
Dan no longer felt safe in his own home.
Tom already told me.
They have to fight the idea.
Tom's really upset.
Why'd you go so sudden?
We all experience her behavior as a negative.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Whose composition is this?
Avoid her.
His eyes lit up with anger.
Why did you yell?
Well, I have news.
This is a good place to set up our tent.
That was beautiful.
Let me stay.
Tom's running to help Mary.
Tom may have cancer.
If we work as a team, we can achieve everything.
That's what you're gonna have to ask.
You gave me a word.
If you're ready to go, we're ready.
I want you to keep your promise.
I can see that no one needs me here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom's the smartest man I know.
"I want to travel." "I want to travel."
There's a lot of birds in the woods.
Please let me stay.
Come on, let's go.
He just wanted to meet me, Tom.
You should ask for their help.
I'll never tell you.
Tom could be richer than we thought.
I never meant to cheat on you.
What the hell was that all about?
I don't have such a desire.
I called a few people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the sword and fled to the window.
I know your soy.
Excuse me.
I can't find the hotel address.
Smoking means suicide.
The hardworms, the peppers and the livers are insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's light a fire.
I wanted to bring you this as soon as possible.
What hat is yours?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom raised his knee.
Where do the pineapple come from?
Can we talk upstairs?
It's made of leather.
I need to get some rest.
Can I take a look at the menu?
He's smart.
Tom took off his coat.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.
Tom showed up, and the crowd cheered up.
I think it's Tom.
Tom worked very valuable, but it didn't work.
Dogs are white.
Get him out of here.
I don't drink gauze drinks.
I want to find Tom.
He's also a writer.
I almost got a heart attack.
I recognize the guy.
Help me, Tom.
Find out where Tom is.
That was really touching.
Get her in there.
You're cooking a peanut cake.
There were no other customers.
I'm not going so whatever he wants to be.
Dan was a very caring father.
Are you a vegetarian?
Day, you've had five sleeping pills.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I quit smoking curses.
I know how it sounds.
Tom apparently didn't stop him from sitting alone.
I'm already feeling much better.
I gave them another chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm hungry.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want them to see me.
Too bad the concrete doesn't burn.
Why is Tom doing this?
Tom stopped at once.
My father carried me here when I was young.
You're such a drummer.
Let go of the bottle.
I'll try to find Tom.
I knew I should've kept my mouth shut.
I'm upset.
Tom's here early.
He was drying his wet clothes at the end of the fire.
He always fought with his knowledge of English.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have blankets?
No part of the pig fell.
She buys an everlasting bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that the last lesson?
My hands are sticky.
What happens next?
Put him in a psychiatric hospital!
You should give them some space.
The cars have four wheels.
Tom's passionate.
What happened is a rare phenomenon.
Tom's packing his bags.
What's the benefit?
That's very useful.
Tom was vibrating his phone.
I decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not coming back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I did last night.
The girl walked slowly.
Turns out you're an unexpected red saying.
Prejudice saves you a lot of time.
That didn't go very well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom wasn't having lunch.
There's someone behind her.
Since the note was written in French, I could not read it.
They made him do the job again.
I'm not giving up now.
This room is full.
I fired her.
Don't be silly.
I can't open my head.
This was Tom's idea.
I decided to let you get back to work.
Tom couldn't hold back.
Tom's still upset.
Do people really have to hate each other?
I didn't hear.
Tom laughed at Mary.
That was the basic idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom, think about it.
I don't mind waiting here at all.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your chain.
That's not a big priority.
Take this.
How much is it now?
Do you understand?
I couldn't help her.
Tom always had everything he wanted.
You're not gonna make it.
Tom cleaned his room.
You know that he would do anything for your beautiful eyes.
I was ready for the war.
Tom slipped on the ice.
I'll never capitulate.
I hope you're ready for a challenge.
Tom likes that idea.
That's the first liver I've seen this spring.
Do you want to play?
Why did he fire us?
I was home last night.
The girl who works in the bakery is cute.
Do you think I know what's going on?
Tom seems happy.
Tom's not too young.
There's phosphorus in our DNA.
Take care of yourself!
Linda was pregnant and suspected of being pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Pick me up at 2:30 from the front gate.
The meeting began more than an hour ago.
She's a bitch.
I feel kind of sick.
I'll do as I know and I can.
I got money.
You can study here.
Tom wasn't told why Mary wasn't there.
Tom, fix yourself.
Tom threw the gun.
They're not cockroaches.
I'm not safe here.
To my great regret, Mary came to the party in a dirty dress.
I'll tell you what you want.
I hope it's useful.
Don't mention anything.
The worst kind of hangover is the emotional hangover.
Let's get in touch.
The bees remove the cane to collect the honey.
I need to help them.
Don't turn your back on me.
I'll never forget him.
Tom won the fight.
You brought them here right now.
Tom lives abroad.
Do they work here?
Tom got his eyes lighted when Mary ran into the room.
I'm relaxed.
Could you even help us?
Maybe it'll take a long time before you see me again.
He was sitting next to the river.
My cat's hungry.
We need some tools.
Be ruthless.
That doesn't seem possible.
Thank you for helping him.
The girl greeted me with a smile.
There's a lot of big cities in Brazil.
I haven't solved that puzzle yet.
Tom respected Mary.
Tom wants us to think he's richer than he is.
Tom was moving his toes.
You know me better than you seem.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He's got big problems.
This isn't blue, it's purple.
Who were you with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
Sheep usually kill them before they're over a year old, and they eat them.
Could you get this gun out of my foot?
I've forgotten how much you know to be smart.
Can I see that?
He spends his money on water.
We're not hiding anything.
I guess I just didn't think so.
I'm not really sure.
Let's put an end to this.
I've already told you a million times you don't have to exaggerate.
Are you really happy?
Ask her to explain.
Come on.
The book is heavy.
Why do we have to find her?
I'm just telling you to be careful.
Tom keeps lying to me.
The rooms in this hotel are obviously very poorly suppressing the sounds, and I hear him in the next room chewing gum!
Are you scared?
Please feed the cat.
We'll be fine.
Let's walk through the market!
Try to be optimistic.
Well, obviously you have romantic feelings for Tom.
I can't find the key.
Look at us.

Let's celebrate.
I didn't play Monopol from college.

Maybe we're relatives.
It's my fault I didn't call you.
Can I use this pen?
Tom washes his face every morning before breakfast.
Why are you asking?
It's not back.
Tom's sleeping tight.
Be smart and don't tell your parents about it!
It was written in front of her.
There are more exits.

He gave me six linen shirts.
I'm safe.

Wow, look at this.
You know, sometimes you should hear it.
Do you know what you're doing?
I got a lot of money.
Don't worry, we'll find him.
I'll use my dream.
What about a sandwich?
I know what to learn.
Hand over the compositions.

Who was Tom talking to?
Why was Tom in there?
Don't drink too much.
We'll follow her.
Everyone here loves you so much, Tom.
This afternoon, we'll eat corn from Italy.

I'm not here for you.
Has anybody hurt yourself?
Tom and I are in love with each other.
It's really weird.
They paid me to paint Tom.
I know it wasn't her.
Tom heard Mary yell.
I couldn't believe this was really happening to me.
The amebians are alive.
If you do that to me, I'll cut off your throat.

Take a clear glass of the poster.
This isn't a joke.
None of that matters.

They say he's very rich.
I'll pay for myself.
I wouldn't mind helping them.
There's a chance they'll kill.
I left a message.
Did you just see that?
That would be a disaster.
I like how the French write their word for "bubamara."
The diaphragm can go up to 20 tons of concrete.
You're beautiful.
I think it's too risky without any help.
Is that what you care about?
We're pretty good.

That's kind of kind.
Tom wiped his forehead.
This book has not yet been translated into French.
Tom's here.
The gangsters made a lot of money from the rich man.
No one ever comes here.
Actually, it's pretty boring.
You're biting your conscience, aren't you?
I wanted blood.
I need a minute.
France's capital is Paris.
I wanted to tell you first.

Tom had a bruise on his hand.
Take the hammer. Your nose's leaking.
Tom went with Mary.
I just saw Tom.
Attention, please!
Tom repeated the question.
They were farmers first.
You just have to trust me.
I just don't want you to do anything you'll regret.
I'm upset.
Tom rarely comes out.

I thought it wouldn't rain last night.
I'm glad you noticed.
Why don't you just ask him?

Go this way.
You're back.

Bring me some food.
Maybe it'll be hard.
I don't curse their children.
You have to help him.
I thought maybe you could help.
I think they lied to you.
Tom ran to his car.
Tom's downstairs.
I don't understand why you want to do that.
It makes us work too hard.
Slow down.
He wants every wedding to be the bridegroom and every funeral deceased.
Tom's probably okay.
I believe in spirits.
My dad's home.
You want to ride with us?
Why don't you wait a few days?
Tom wasn't surprised when he saw Mary and John.
Have a good night.
I told you the truth.
They offer free condoms.
Wet climate conditions are not the property of the peninsula.

We could talk about her.
I'll find you later.
What do you think of Boston?
I've never surfed.
I'll find something.
We've been eating bunny soup.
We can work in the open if it's light.

Where's the phone?
They'll pay us well.
Tom seemed torn apart.

I've got a car wrong.
I'm not smart.
Maybe I'll die tomorrow.

What's the story?
So these are the weirdest prisoners I've ever seen.
This is where I spend most of the day.
Should we wait here?
If you go out this big, you'll get it.
Does it still hurt?
It was pretty funny.
I set it up.
I'm a member here.
Hey, what's going on?
Did you say something to Tom?
Are they all busy?
They don't want the people to be independent.
I'm dying of thirst.
What kind of food do you want to cook?
I'll do it myself.
Allah knows.

Where were you last year?
Let's find out more about Tom.
I should go home.
Tom didn't resist.
We were doing a quiz today.
I'm dead serious.
Give me the wine.
All stores are closed.
You made white again!
Stop squeezing the dick.
Tom's done with the orchards.
That didn't happen.
Be a man.
No need for a drama.

There's only one way to solve this.
I'd better go.
I was the one who dug up this hole.

No matter what you do, always do your best.
Dan encouraged Linda to report rape.
Tom's a responsible adult.
I can't call them home.
You're a racist.
I already forgave you.

I still can't believe it.
What's the short one?
Thanks again for coming.
Mom.

Do you intend to help him?
We went between the trees.
I'll do it anyway.
I knew you'd stand on Tom's side.
They couldn't get away with it.
We need to find them tonight.
It's too impressive.
It's my fault I didn't call them.
Pray to the Lord, not to his prophets.
Tom was acting like a knight.
Now we're even with him.
We're walking to school together.
You're so talented.
I need to fix this.
Where are you going?
I have lunch in the afternoon.
I hate it when you fight.
I was supposed to be more cultural.
Have fun with Tom.
It's still growing.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
This fits perfectly.
He was slapping his bow with his bowel.
I'm sorry, but my answer is denied.
I'll get it for you.
Tom wrote two books.
My advice is not to give Tom any gift.
Tom was working.
Tom lived right next to me when I was a kid.
Tom puts his hand around Mary.
She has short hair.
The crowd laughed.
I'll send her to stay with you.
Tom didn't buy it.
I don't have a Turkish keyboard.
I came here to learn.
He came down the stairs.
Can I make something up?
I have to put water in the radiator.
I'll go with Tom.
Tom and Mary will probably never see each other again.
Let's see.
The European wants to drink wine.
My husband's a good man.
He's got a lot of debts.
She knows the major cities.
What's under the roof?
Nobody wants to play with her.
Tom, everyone's having a drink.
Are you ready to go?
Tom's obviously out of his mind.
Tom came to them.
You think you can fool me?
My name is Ivan.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
It can't be him.
Tom certainly didn't want to say that.
Who needs rhetorical questions?
Mary was proud of her face.
The teacher's teaching.
I wasn't even here.
The question is when.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
The waiter was rude.
That's not good enough.
First of all, I have something I want to show you.
Why are they afraid?
I'm wearing my passport.
It was a masterpiece they talked about a lot.
What was the question?
Science is not a fantasy.
Who's your boss?
Ask her when she gets back.
I don't have a pen.
When should we start caring?
I thought about what Tom said.
Tom wants vanilla ice cream.
Aren't you ashamed to talk like that?
They concluded that the ship was sinking immediately.
Did you buy the medicine?
Did Tom drink?
It hurts my work.
The question is who will do that.
I'm leaving for Boston tomorrow.
They despise him.
Are they all happy?
I thought we'd have some time here and talk.
Forget about that, okay?
I need to call him.
You're acting weird.
That guy's pissing me off.
That's a reasonable compromise.
I'm sure Tom would really like to see you.
I wasn't right at all.
Please, ask me what it is.
Hey, what's up now?
I'm not ashamed.
Tom's under medical care.
Ask Tom where he is.
What do you look like?
Tom's a wunderkind.
That foot goes to school.
It's starting to get in our head that we can't ignore nature.
I don't understand why you don't want to help.
Tom seems very clever.
Now the question is, what should we do?
When was the last time you talked to Tom?
He's finished fourth of 56 racers.
Don't shout.
Do you trust Tom now?
We haven't seen Tom.
When Tom was a kid, she was obsessed with the girl who lived on the opposite side of the street.
I think I can.
Tom forgets.
Sounds really good.
Tom really likes Boston.
Tom upset Mary's silence.
They'll be there soon.
Tom found what he was looking for.
I'll be in my quarters.
They weren't acting fast.
I'm weak.
You're wearing a wooly sweater.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
Vampires live forever unless someone kills them.
I wouldn't want to hang out with Tom.
They'll never take you to that club.
Tom wasn't born blind.
Is Tom looking for them?
Here's the bride!
I know my job.
Tom hasn't reported it.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I didn't know you lived in Boston.
They left me alone.
These animals are in danger.
Tom made a suggestion.
Don't make me a liar, Tom.
Tom left the door open.
It's not that small.
Mary divorced her husband a few years ago.
Can we talk about them?
Tom was the first young man to break my heart.
They all turned around to look at her.
Don't you dare ask them that.
That can't be true.
Tom's ready.
We need to help them.
These are very immature.
Tom didn't answer right away.
He has enormous potential.
Dan's messages were scandalous.
We listened carefully so as not to miss a word.
I already have plans for the weekend.
Why are you so upset tonight?
Tom fell back.
We're exaggerating.
Please, let me finish.
Tom says it's not too late for compensation.
Is the house ready?
Tom's jokes are angry, and they get even better when he drinks a few beers.
You've got a very kind eye.
You don't understand business.
Is this your bag or his?
Tom called to say he can't come and help.
Why do you hate us so much?
Yeah, yeah, he'll fix it... when the worm gives birth to a grape.
Tom's a counselor.
Can I talk to you?
He insulted me by calling me an ass.
Who's got a light from?
It could be Tom alone.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.
What happened to all that money?
Tom wants the same thing as you.
I didn't betray anything.
I was thinking about you just yesterday.
I know where to look.
Tom wrote me a letter.
For him it's impossible to quit smoking.
My hair's falling.
The big question that no one has found the answer, including me and me, despite thirty years of research on the woman's soul, is "What do women want?"

The villagers reap the harvest.
Tom won't like it.
Tom and his friends went to the circus.
How deep is the failure?
I can work wherever I want.
What's on the table?
Tom's not violent.
Don't talk about them like that.
We're not bad people, Tom.
Did you ask her to leave?
Keep your promises.
I've been looking everywhere.
What was the subject?
Every time we're separated, we taste death.
Tom was a fanatic.
Is it over your head from me?
Tom wants to talk.
Tom looks like he's ready to cry.
She looked around.
They're vegetarians.
Tom was angry.
Tom needed advice.
My laser printer knows how to scan images.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
They put him in jail.
How would you describe her?
Maybe Tom doesn't realize how valuable that picture is.
Everyone's up.
Money is not a criterion for success.
I want to know when your birthday is.
Guys, what are you talking about?
Keep me lucky!
The concert's over with the people's gym.
We were looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I won't move.
Wait a second.
I've got something to do with it.
Your propaganda isn't interesting.
He was running as fast as he could.
I won.
Every nuance is lost in translation.
Tom had nothing else to say.
How would you help me?
Go find them.
I have no comment.
I think he's hiding something?
I hope there's plenty of air here.
She's married to a man's zero.
The wind is cold.
Nothing's changed.
You don't have to wear anything disgusting.
The old man was a baby before he died.
I don't like this book.
Luckily, I hit him.
What would Tom be looking for?
The sun is a star among billions of others.
I've got some Spaniards.
Can anyone help me?
We're leaving this afternoon.
I can't ask anyone to do that.
I need to get over Tom.
You can ask them yourself.
We want to be famous.
That's pretty normal.
Did you ask Google?
It's not yet spring.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't bother me, Tom.
How old is this TV?
This mystery is solved.
Tom was taken to the hospital.
I hated her.
I still have a lot to learn.
Drinking alcohol on the street or in the park is illegal in most of the United States.
Well, there's an explanation.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope that's exactly what I'm hoping for.
Are you sure we don't have to order first?
The one who can hear the butterfly laughs knows and the taste of the clouds.
We played golf.
This is my grandmother.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
We need someone good.
He wouldn't lie to you.
Tom's going to be obedient.
Just find them.
I can't get through to them.
They pulled a trap to see who would go first.
I gave him a chance.
You've got a great job.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
There's no hope.
Iftar is not to eat like goods!
But if I were in Brazil, I would be much more afraid.
Did you work as a bartender so far?
Did you forget that again?
I don't like it at all.
I just finished my working hours.
Where will this product be used?
I'm not a student.
I have flu and I'm tired.
Mary had flowers in her hair.
Tom looked under the couch.
If the food is cold, warm it up in the microwave oven.
The stream is right of us.
Tom's not an old man.
This looks too simple.
I want to get my old life back.
Is that your package?
Dan gave Linda all the money she had saved.
I think it's time you left now.
This guy's a bandit.
It's possible that Tom saw it.
Tom's a little bit of a bitch.
Tom's very unsuspecting.
What did they mean?
How's the cylinder volume?
He was a great musician.
Tom's not drunk, but he's got a drink.
I like your company.
Tom, you have to get up.
Tom wants revenge.
Tom put a fork in the drawer.
Will I be replaced?
I need help.
You can count on us.
Tom found a new job.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks it's too cool for me.
The whales are kind of titties.
Dan fooled Matt and forced him to apologize to Linda.
I totally understand.
Tom seems shaken.
Are they brothers?
"Do you like his music?" "No, and you?"
Thank you all for coming.
Tom said he didn't want to eat in that restaurant.
He's getting ready to turn around.
This will make our job much easier.
I think that's terrible.
What's on the desk?
Are you still jealous?
Why would he leave here?
He took over the business.
You don't even want fish.
I saw Tom do it.
Her mother speaks Italian.
I'm on vacation here.
He's got wine.
His feelings were not returned.
You're not that young anymore.
I love the rhythm of funeral marches.
We're probably lying.
Tom ate his dinner.
If you're interested, tell me and I'll give you his number.
Tom knew he wouldn't be able to do much about it.
I like this.
Squeeze your sleeves.
I can't believe we really did this.
How many miles from here to Boston?
I really care about that.
Does it hurt so much?
I just want to be able to support my family, just as I am.
I'm ready for the storm.
Tom poisoned Mary.
He has developed feelings for her.
He was still there.
I have a bunch of questions.
Who's in charge of things here?
I've heard a lot about you.
Tom might say something we don't want to hear.
Every nation has its own language.
You'd never accept it.
It'll be even colder.
What are you drinking?
As it happened - as it happened.
His legs were broken.
Tom raised his keys.
It all stopped.
Maybe Tom's drunk.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
We don't want any new accidents.
I'd like to go, too.
We don't need Tom anymore.
The value of music is underestimated.
Can you show me this place on the map?
Tom's unmistakable.
What's the matter with you?
Tom went to Ajillak.
Look ahead.
We've never done that before.
Here's what I think happened.
Is Tom mad at you?
This is my newest look.
I haven't been doing well for two days.
It's a waste of the stomach.
We don't think so.
I think Tom's rich.
I must have invented it.
Tom doesn't know the difference between the brain and the donkey.
The police arrested her.
Take these.
We're expecting her.
There's no point in getting out of the rain.
I'll tell them to go right away.
Tom wasn't supposed to marry Mary.
I got an asylum.
There was no living soul in the city.
I think you know who I am.
I haven't seen you in a while, guys.
I can do this all day.
That's not a problem.
Would you like to sit down?
Tom had doubts.
Tom was kicking Mary with a fucking egg.
We're all safe.
Okay, I get the idea.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me take it.
Tom may not be as busy as he says he is.
None of what happened here makes any sense.
I set them up.
What are some of the symptoms associated with fungal poisoning?
And what are you doing here at all?
Don't despair.
I want to watch porn with lesbians.
And who are you?
Tom wants Mary to make sure John writes her homework.
I can handle her.
Can you play that keyboard chord?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Shut up, please.
Tom's worried right now.
I don't have any feelings for her.
I guess I was expecting a little better.
I already do.
She writes a letter to her mother.
They're different.
What did you write?
Tom was acting like he was surprised.
It was impossible for the boy to cross the river.
Tom had arrived earlier than Mary.
The feeling was mutual.
We want to know about them.
They're delicious.
The old house has some charm.

What's the answer?
Did I say I'm done?
Tom doesn't like girls wearing high heels.
Dream you know.
I looked at her.
A great crowd gathered.
Is this a good time to talk?
I'm worried about your health.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
The time in April is unrelenting.
Get your hands off Tom.
Are you crazy, people?
I'm warm.
Tom was the boss.
Can you give him a minute?
We laughed at them.
That's how I like it.
Would you do me a favor?
This is between me and Tom.
I'm irreplaceable.
Give him a second chance.
I cut the sandwich.
Can I see you later?
Tom's legs were cold.
Boys and girls read.
Tom has two kids.
In short, it's your fault.
I'm surprised to see you here.
Tom despised Mary.
Tom ran into the fence.
I met your girlfriend.
You're my luck.
Accept Tom's advice.
Tom left unsweetened food on the table.
Tom's changing course.
There's no living man in the school.
The rocket flew.
We were laughing.
Tom was a little sloppy.
Tom was only here for a visit.
Where do we start?
I know you're a spy.
I wish you a happy trip.
Go back to your seat.
Tom was considerate.
Tom tried to seem busy, so Mary did not ask him to help her.
I don't eat meat very rarely.
I'll go ask her.
I'm keeping his seat.
Tom couldn't help it.
I'll call her later.
The flowers come fast after you cut them.
I called them yesterday.
I'm wearing a bag of rice.
I can do it for them.
Tom doesn't write well.
I ate late last night.
I just don't like it.
Plus, I can fly.
We've been spending our money.
There was hatred between them.
There's nothing to be seen here.
Does that sound stupid?
You wouldn't want to be late.
I really want to help him.
We're friends with him.
I may admire others, but I never hesitated to be anything but who I am.
Sometimes it's hard to determine whether Tom's happy or not.
This doesn't warm me up.
I'll read it to you.
Let's go inside and talk.
Did you imagine a wish?
Children sometimes fear the darkness.
Stand aside.
I had to stay.
Tom's the only one who doesn't understand French.
Tom asked for Mary's money.
Who bought you this?
Tom's gonna catch you.
My bags are packed.
Tom's on.
I've got hair.
This is the best restaurant in our area.
There he is, I like him.
He crossed the street.
As long as there's life, there's hope.
I heard them go missing.
It's a shame I didn't drive by the wheel here.
I have to visit Tom.
What are you uncomfortable about?
Do you still need a babysitter for Monday night?
I'm not wearing provocative clothes.
This is classified.
That's not so much.
That's what you said an hour ago.
I don't want to die.
Let me be damned!
I'd have walked alone first.
How many herbs do you buy?
Come back as soon as you can.
Mr. Jackson, your son died of overdose.
Nothing can stop us.
He's not in the mood.
What did you get?
I motivated you.
I don't want to shadow you.
I didn't see where he put his car keys.
Are you sure you don't want to consider another option?
He didn't give them a chance.
He showed up all of a sudden.
I'll do as you order.
It's a long story.
Tom's gonna be great.
Tom was kind to all Mary's friends.
That would be fun.
He's trading half-cars.
Appreciate the thought.
I'm not leaving.
Do you know that?
You've done a bad job.
Tom's cold.
Emily's a teenager.
They think it's too many.
Who was the thief?
He's got a charm.
The question is who decides what to do.
Tom won't catch me.
You're absolutely right.
My voice in the photos doesn't sound like my natural voice.
I told you this was gonna get tough.
I didn't know if to get mad or laugh.
I'm mad at you.
We've been waiting.
Tom got up at seven o'clock.
I've always wanted a dog.
You're totally safe.
Tom seems to have everything he needs.
The question is, will he visit us next month?
The puppets run them with wires.
I don't want to talk about time.
I'm not as fast as you are.
The other girls were wearing her because of her clothes.
You're gonna get confused.
I'm not following you.
Maybe Tom already did what he was supposed to do.
I'll give them another chance.
He just called me.
Failure made him depressed.
How are you these days, Tom?
I can't stand to see him.
Some people are afraid of spiders.
She doesn't even understand me.
Bees believe that genetically modified plants are harmful to bees of health.
Now you can go.
They're pulling back.
Tom's a second year.
If I can understand, then everyone can.
Tourists weren't satisfied.
Tom, I've got the socks.
I'll check the list.
Didn't I tell you not to?
Tom, he's a whacker.
Laws are like spiders -- they hunt flies, but they let the axes and the cowards break.
You're too proud of a peacock.
When did Tom go to Boston?
He left the key to the desk, as he was used to.
He took off his fur jacket down, got up, and gently knocked on the door.
Tom seems so happy.
We don't look at the same subject, but I'm not the one who's wrong.
Something was on Tom.
You love your life, don't you?
Your desserts are tempting, but we're all set.
We were looking for you.
You're my neighbor.
I'm happy to help.
We're leaving Boston.
I'll wait in the gym.
Tom doesn't want tennis.
How long has Tom been here?
She sends messages to her boyfriend.
Did anyone see Tom?
He avoided the danger.
What did I tell you?
How many times do I have to do that again?
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
Tom seems desperate.
You sound like you're relieved.
Tom's unforgettable.
Kyot is an exceptionally beautiful city.
This handle doesn't turn.
I think you're right.
Everything's so weird.
I'm writing my will.
"Why did you break my lips?" "Dearly."
We were very close.
It's after me every day.
Give me your knife.
Nobody's defending my country.
Tom never gave up.
I asked her not to interfere.
We're not expecting a big day tomorrow.
Tom's a drug addict.
We weren't hungry.
This is amazing.
Wait for me to be surprised.
What do you know about cloning?
Where's my wallet?
Now he's watching TV.
What happened here?
Why is Tom crying?
That's a coincidence.
I'm so glad I'm home.
Can we stop?
I guess that's okay.
You can hug me, torture me, and even destroy my body, but you'll never catch my mind.
It's poison.
I need to know who helped her.
It happens all the time.
I wish I could be as happy as you are.
Try this sweater.
The cat put his claws in my hand.
"When did you sleep yesterday?" "At four o'clock." "What did you do so late?" "I spoke on the phone with the former."
How did you catch them?
No offense!
I was a little overwhelmed with another.
His heart was broken by unrelenting love.
When is it too much?
What does a man like you see in a woman like me?
You're bothering me.
His rank isn't high enough for that position.
Are you deaf?
I belong here.
You're my friends.
He's a professional chair.
Tom's not as naive as many people think.
I hit a box in his jaw.
We have two daughters and one son.
I'm gonna take a break for lunch.
Did that man attack you?
Fill out the form.
There was no one there.
Do you speak English?
Is there a word at all?
You're not a Canadian.
I'm really getting married.
They all rejected Tom.
You can't fire him.
Ken's collecting old money.
There's a lot to say.
I heard what you're saying.
We have to face the facts.
No harm.
I really want to know what's going on here.
Tom's scaring me.
Tom's sleeping on his back.
I'm here with Tom.
I can call you a cab.
You're not in any danger.
What can I choose from?
We have to put them in bed.
The only meal Tom puts on meat is a pepper.
That's how I got close to Tom.
I don't want to derange them.
Tom was beaten.
We're really good.
He fell asleep while he was driving, so he caused a traffic.
I brought a few bottles of wine.
Do you like Boston?
Tom was very upset.
Why would Tom do that?
I have a job for you.
How does a set of names form?
You saved my life.
It was too little.
It looks different.
That's very rare.
I've got a bad stomach from him.
It's improved.
This world is a valley of tears.
You don't have to be crazy to work here.
I saw Tom.
Don't even get mad.
Tom put the gun down.
Tom needs a bottle.
Get me some coffee.
You're gonna be okay.
That was a subtle trick.
We'll leave the theory to the mathematicians.
Where's this from?
We're not done.
Tom was put in prison for spying.
Is there anything we can do to help him?
I hope you and Tom aren't too disappointed.
These little letters are only read with a bow.
I don't see the end.
They'll come looking for her.
This tooth is a cutlery.
We're here to help.
He's a military officer.
He was very brave.
I'm not gonna keep my breath.
Don't buy him anything.
I hear grief in your voice.
She's crazy about him.
The thermometer shows 10 degrees.
When did you buy that from me?
Where are the guns?
Did you kiss anyone?
I'll do as you say.
I would do anything to make money.
I recognize you now.
I don't want you to say something you don't think.
I decorated my room.
This is just crazy!
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see how he is.
Stay with Tom to get his boss.
Our turn was approaching the small island.
You won't win.
Wait a minute. I'm done. I'm gonna go get him.
Tom was a miner.
It's all white.
I wish I had enough power at my will to keep my diet.
The man in question is currently in America.
He's considered guilty.
I'll take a look at Tom.
I'll be at my desk.
I'm here the first time.
That pipe sounds really bad to me.
My eyes are tired.
I need to get away from her.
Tom makes 300,000 dollars a year.
Do I really need this?
Are you expecting them?
It's a quick favor.
We had to help Tom.
That's all they're talking about.
One boy grabbed my bag while passing by with a wheel.
When was the last time you needed the baby?
I'm a little hurt by my muscles.
We have experience.
Tom doesn't look very good.
I'm a scratch.
They'll fire me because I'm too late for work.
I thought it'd be nice to buy you a couple of engagements.
Tom what's he gonna do now?
That's right!
There's always a nice thing.
Why don't you go to a doctor?
Ghost, are you there?
There's no smoke in here.
Are you still working on the freezer?
The city restored that old, historic building.
I can't ask him.
She's really ugly.
Tom's back covered in mud.
It's not for you.
Tom was wondering if Mary would know what was wrong.
I have nothing else.
Tom's in the pool with his friends.
Tom wasn't paranoid.
You're very good with kids.
I just threw it in the trash.
We just got out of here.
Tom booked a seat.
I want to use this.
What color was Tom's socks?
Tom baked my cake.
I've never been a jury before.
I've always admired Tom.
I don't want to be touched.
Look at the clouds.
He was so angry that his veins were jammed.
Travel abroad is not considered.
Tom ended up winning.
Tom just got here.
I'm here to apologize.
It won't be enough.
I'm hiding from Tom.
I returned home and told my wife about the work in Boston.
Tom took off and lay down.
And the opposite applies.
Tom's very naive.
Tom didn't want to go that early.
I'll explain later.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I'm chewing gum.
The girl playing the piano is my sister.
I'm not sure anymore.
Don't lose hope.
Were you there?
She's wearing shuffles.
They don't miss rocks.
Tom's gone to the wheel.
He's back at 6:00.
It has been proved that the pain in dogs is higher than that in cats.
Be careful when you climb the stairs.
Were you with anyone?
I'm not a monster.
What's this made of?
The butler opened the door.
Tom was wrong all the time.
Get your hands off me.
Don't say that name about me.
Are you gonna throw it away?
Tom's got a good profession.
They're my stuff.
Tom went for a walk every day.
The same thing happened to my friend.
I can't feel it anymore for you.
Tom's not stupid.
Tom's changing the subject.
We'll deal with this.
It's a very nice feeling.
What's Tom drinking?
I'll read this.
Give me the glasses.
I'm helping them with something.
I know about him.
We have the key.
Tom had a disastrous failure.
He just got back from vacation.
Tell your son to stop bothering my daughter.
The text is too long.
When did you come to Boston?
I'm late for something.
The caves contain significant quantities of minerals.
Tom left them.
She's avoiding me.
Tom's back to work.
I want you to find them.
Shouldn't we wait for them?
I wouldn't like that.
I hear you're rich.
Most people are more afraid of making a mistake than of making a mistake.
This is a stupid question, but who's stronger, a lion or a tiger?
We'll have company.
We're students.
Tom took the tape out of the champagne.
She's a missing girl.
Tom despises your stupidity.
Don't eat live pig.
Tom made a list of places he wants to visit.
From his point of view, I concluded that I was angry.
I miss Boston.
The girl brought me red and white roses.
We should ask them.
I think you know Tom.
They don't make you happy.
It's time to get to work.
He shot three times.
I'll regret it if I like it.
They're free.
Will you come back?
We can talk about it.
My daughter sings in chorus.
I don't even have a word to say anymore.
You can make it easier for yourself.
You know my dick.
It wasn't easy for me to admit I was wrong.
We're the best.
Now go ahead.
Tom can't help you.
Tom's not going to the market.
Give me a few minutes.
You know how to recognize children's voices without problems.
I suggest we go home.
Tom refused to talk to me.
Tom doesn't like me.
Don't you happen to know Tom?
Tom wasn't sure if he liked the plan.
Tom's very young.
Tom's so stupid.
Tom wants to see it.
Tom was just joking in part.
I'll find out who did this.
Tom hates his job.
I can make a call.
Why don't you trust me?
Tom was trying to avoid stealing it.
Did you find her already?
Tom's there alone.
You did a good job.
Don't be a faggot.
Freedom of speech is limited in certain countries.
Tom raised his hat.
We're looking for them.
I think Tom's right.
Could you recommend a good book for me?
I'll take you home.
Does the stomach hurt?
Is Tom dead?
You don't tell me.
Try to wash yourself.
I think I love you.
I'm taking care of all of you.
She was quiet next to her.
You're a pig.
You're not reliable.
Tom can be trusted.
It'll be hard to convince them.
Don't be suffocating now.
Did anyone see Tom?
I'd like some help with this.
I owe Tom a lot.
It was an incredible night.
The smells of jasmine and lavender are my favorite.
I just want you to turn around and look at me.
Tom seems to have been bored.
She's very personalistic.
The knife had a very old top.
Get ready.
Put him down here.
I swear, I wouldn't even catch you burning and you being the last bucket of water.
The universe is expanding.
I thought you lost your watch.
Now you're in charge.
Not all of them sleep.
Did everyone agree?
These are my prayers.
Aren't you going?
Do you know anyone who could help?
This week is amazingly hot.
No one wanted to get out of the table.
Do you think Tom would like this?
Tom's been through a break.
He's a fool.
Maybe you can help them.
The heart of the broken mirror lay flat on the floor.
I can't ask him for that.

I'm sorry I lied to you before.
I've got a few minutes off.
I'm sorry, but it's not until now.
When was the last time you were in an art gallery?
Play that song again.
I really like vanilla ice cream.
I just had breakfast.
Step by step, he goes down the stairs.
That's not supposed to happen.
Let me change the subject.
I'll make cracks.
Tom put a stethoscope on the chest.
Should we call him?
My sister for Christmas got more presents than I did.
What's going on with you at work?
What's the taste of languages and not tastes?
Let's play football.
Tom stopped yelling.
Did you have any survivors?
I'm still at work.
Tom's hot.
Where's the bathroom?
Tom seems to know everything.
She gave birth to twins.
My boy's a journalist.
What's Tom afraid of?
Tom would object.
What brand of shampoo do you use?
It's about playing cards.
We all love you.
What were they doing?
I think you should get rid of this yourself.
As far as I can see, nothing's medically relevant to Tom.
I saw him playing cards with all of them.
Tom seems confidential.
Shame on you!
Is Tom still alive?
Does Tom have a tail?
I thought you'd live with us.
How do I know how to get back?
I'm going to dinner with an old friend.
Foods can be cooked without being angry.
Bring her home.
I'd help if I could.
Anyone who wants flowers can't be a bad man.
Get your computer.
What's this key from?
Tom needs to thank you.
I'll see you when I get there.
That could be true.
I wasn't sure what to do.
Camille, I wish I hadn't married Tom.
I know what it is.
When does Tom arrive?
Could you give me the remote control?
I'm gonna make him take off your lawn.
You're helping once.
We cried in a duet.
I'll set the table.
I have a lot to say.
I was in the bedroom.
There shouldn't be any trouble.
It's hard to imagine that.
Where's the nearest digeridua repair workshop?
Where did you go with Tom?
Does anyone know Tom's phone number here?
I don't know what I got.
I haven't fixed it yet.
I don't work for him.
I can't wait to go home.
Tom killed himself on his 30th birthday.
Let's go and see what happens.
The concert drunk has no pedals at all.
I'll save you a place.
We were all shocked.
I don't react well to threats.
Take a breath and hold it.
I love Boston very much.
I know a city whose inhabitants never smoked.
I must have forgotten.
Tom told Mary to go to the party with him.
Tom knows how to do almost anything.
We arrested him.
What else could you have done?
Please sign here.
I'll check if it's in there.
It'll be beastly.
I don't think I can move.
I'm glad I can be yours.
He's talking a lot.
I'm not very normal.
I thought they found him.
Why don't we order pizza?
The worse, the better.
Is your head full of straw?
Tom doesn't seem to speak French.
The fruit contains seeds.
You're doing fine.
I don’t have enough time to do everything I have to do.
The forest is my home.
There's a swelling in the head.
Vampires can't cross the threshold of a certain house without being invited.
I think Tom's upset.
I need peace and quiet after the hard day at work.
If you ignore the past, you threaten the future.
The windows in my room are broken.
Do you hate him so much?
I want the truth.
Why don't we go and collect them?
Please, find her.

I'm not ready yet.
This bird doesn't know how to fly.
I'm not a trucker.

I saw him right now.
What's going to happen to us?
My hometown is by the ocean.
I left home at 7:00.
How's it going, Tom?
The wind changed the direction.
Please don't ask her.
I have to take them home.
No one will ever forget you.
Why didn't you call before you got here?
I can't get an answer from Tom.
I'd love to know this before.
Is there something missing?
I didn't do it for him.
She felt quite lonely.
I'm going hunting at leisure.
Where'd my driver go?
He's got a flaw in him.
The coat's beaded with fur.
Tom's ugly.
When did you buy that with Tom?
I've been reported.
He was sleeping hard.
I didn't even doubt it.
The pins are made in bottles.
Tom doesn't experience it like that.
Tom was sitting on the stairs talking to a girl named Mary.
I know what you were doing.
I always eat.
Tom gave Mary a message from John.
Your wishes are my command.
I have an apartment in Boston.
Can I ask you a question?
I want you to go to Boston with Tom.
Someone just called.
Can I show you something?
I'm not a big sailor.
My dad got a light on the white drops last month.
What a sad story!
Try to get a good night's sleep.
I don't think I'll live long enough.
You need to help her.
Take care of him.
Tom wasn't aware that Mary was hoping to kiss her.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I don't have any friends.
Tom's playing a band and he's very handsome.
Why can't you take it?
Put the gun down.
Tom lost interest.
Let's play a volleyball.
It was fun yesterday.
Tom may help us if we ask him nicely.
Tom enjoys eating at restaurants.
Tom says he's used to hospital food.
This is my problem.
I don't think he's gay.
That was a secret, wasn't it?
I wouldn't think so.
I ate chicken medallions.
My dream came true.
This is a wooden table.
The situation is tense.
I'm interested in Greek mythology too.
The observatory has a good location.
I'm in charge of propaganda.

They're pretty good.
Did you admit it?
Tom's a diabetic.
Call him whatever you want.
I'll send Tom to take care of it.
How would you fix it?
This sounds familiar.
Would you like to watch TV?
Of course!
They're not happy.
They were verbally abused.
Why were you chasing me?
I was pretty busy.
I couldn't do what you were doing.
Are you always busy?
Tom, you heard the walnut.
You're below her level.
Wisdom is a curse when it does not help the one who owns it.
What is the origin of the universe?
Whoever calls, tell him I'm out.
I convinced Tom to go to Boston with Mary.
The sheep feed on grass.
Tom's gonna give up.
I didn't know you were unhappy here.
Tom gave up thinking of going to Boston.
I didn't find anything wrong.
Tom works efficiently.
I should be alone.
I can take it from them.
I read Tom's story.
Why are you tired?
Tom said he'd leave at 2:30.
I'll take it with him.
It has nothing to do with luck.
I think you know the rules.
I'm sincerely complaining about that.
How are we today?
There's your wife.
He's back at 6:00.
Let these people go.
Tom didn't blink his eye.
You're a good son.
I'll get you to talk to Tom.
I was about to call them.
Lamia looked at her.
I have to turn the phone off.
Time's good.
This was the wrong information.
No one wants to be around him.
Dan saw him talking to an unknown man near the restaurant.
Tom did it with ease.
I know you're tired.
Why didn't you graduate?
There's a mess in front of my house.
He's the boss of the company.
Peace at home, peace in the world.
They hate each other.
I'm very busy getting ready for the party.
It won't improve.
He's already done his job.
My ears are shut.
We're not worried.
Don't stay too long.
Tom lives in a boat.
Let's be creative.
You look pretty bad.
I don't want to push myself any more.
We went to the same church.
I arrived in Boston in two and a half.
How could Tom know?
She's going to school for the deaf.
You have a habit I don't like.
You sound very safe.
How desperate are you?
I don't know why I stayed so long.
I don't want to wait.
What's that, to be invisible to him?
The radio's off.
I turned him down, Tom.
You should be proud.
I'm in love and confused.
I keep most of my money at the bank near my office.
Remember what happened last year?
You're gonna go with me and the point!
It's not worth much.
I need you to find them.
Everything went well.
Where are my bags?
We all know Tom.
Let us do our utmost.
I'll pay.
Tom can't help us at all.
I'd rather sit down.
Read this.
I got here a few minutes before you.
I'm helping him.
That's blackmail.
I'm starting to worry.
Tom and Mary work in the same office.
Envy is a sin.
All children are foreigners.
They shot me.
Tom's not inclined to play.
I finished twenty-five projects in just one month.
Tom couldn't leave to look through the key.
Tea smells good.
Well, I lied.
Do you trust them?
That column isn't exactly vertical.
Let's see what happens if we let Tom do what he wants.
I'm very good with animals.
Did someone tell you that?
Why are you calling?
They were talking quietly.
Tom wanted Mary to teach him French.
We need to get back.
I mean it.
I don't think Tom knows how to do that.
Tom's got a little dick.
Tom believes everything Mary told him.
Let's make a deal.
I'm not going anywhere.
Well, what's the point?
Can you sign this?
He's as tall as she is.
They were chasing them.
I didn't believe him.
Now you can't help us.
Do you know how much it costs?
I was thinking of visiting the museum together.
Ah, I've been here before!
That was the idea.
You were chased.
Let's go down the street.
A living soul was not in the parking lot.
Tom knew Mary didn't speak French.
I'm not digging your wells.
I've got a few more minutes left.
Wait a minute.
Tom loves you very much.
You're cooking nice.
There's no shorter way to the top, just to the gaps.
Tom's pretty weak.
His surface was as flat as a mirror.
Don't you want to keep it?
Tom's paying a lot.
It was sad.
It looks like you cared about her.
Come and dance with me.
I've already asked everyone.
Auto cars are now being distributed.
I can't make that decision.
I told the police that Tom was with me at that time.
He went to eat.
Then there's a problem...
Tom's wearing the chairs.
No matter what you do, you have to give up on yourself.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's the new money.
I fooled Tom again.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I have to be punished.
Who ate my dinner?
The organ was an older man.
I played tennis.
I think you can help me.
Is his aunt eating apples or bananas?
You're a moron.
She was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do as I showed you?
I'm making kygan.
I want the blue color.
The girl released the bird.
I didn't tell you to accept the bribe.
Don't suck my coffee.
Tom gave his daughter a hairy rabbit.
I think we should help him.
If there's no pornography with that, it'll be done.
I've been ringing for hours.
He died a few years ago.
Can you teach me how to play dumb?
They picked her nice.
What does that mean?
I did what I could.
We have three children.
I'll give you mine.
I hope that didn't really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
She was a mystery to me that I was spending the night with a smart, spiritual, and beautiful girl like you.
I'm a little rusty.
The girl ran away from home and got rid of parental control.
Tom's a wreck.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
A census took place in 2005.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
You said you'd text me a quarterback, but you lied to me, obviously.
Guess.
He's dressed up to take a bath.
The river of the floor began to lie down on my face.
Mary gave up her moral values and became an unbeliever.
Let's just get rid of it.
I'm learning math.
The pianos are expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
How were you doing?
The movies are a great time.
I haven't seen anything before.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's just a temporary solution.
We stole it.
Make me love jazz.
They're staring at you.
I would do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you're planning on leaving.
How many guests do we expect tonight?
She's in the hospital.
Looks like I misjudged him.
I appreciate your help with this.
Everybody was smiling.
I didn't ask for your opinion.
They canceled our flight because of unfavorable weather conditions.
If the universe is the answer, what is the question?
Tom was patient.
Singers use microphones to make their voices loud.
They can come back.
I'm so scared!
The whole board is against that.
The world lights up the sun.
His argument was logical.
Come here now, Tom.
That wasn't exactly true.
I'll go see what I can find out.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom made himself a tree.
Oh, that's great.
Avoid bad associations.
The airport is nearby.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom's not scared.
I cut my finger.
What did I do with that brochure?
It didn't get that bad.
The tape doesn't come out.
Tom killed himself.
Tom promised to watch over Mary.
Mary wants to drink hot coffee and Tom's milk.
I gave you a fake address.
I'm out of my mind.
I'm not angry anymore.
There's a great chance Jane's coming.
I'm hungry.
I think so.
I think you panicked.
The wallet I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl has a deaf ear.
You're gonna need this.
I don't care what you think of Tom.
They started shooting.
Tom's stuck.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you make that up, Tom?
What's my lawyer gonna be?
The nuns sing.
Tom recommended Mary.
Who were they?
Tom started talking.
Tom doesn't look very good.
I'll really try to be kind to Tom.
Tom eats everything.
Where's Tom buying?
It looked terrible.
They're all liars.
How can someone be so stupid?
Tom left without me.
Everything is quiet again.
That's a minor mistake.
I really hope so.
Have a good time.
I've got a lot of problems right now.
Answer me right now.
Let me help.
Tom has problems with anger.
Get him.
You're paying me very well.
I feel like a new man.
Bring me a drink.
I think I'm real.
The question is whether or not.
Tom's running up.
Tom's gonna kill me when he finds out what I did.
He's still there.
Aren't you going to eat?
You should make this work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you were only dating girls that were inferior to you.
I have to tie my belt.
Tom was about to have a fight with Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom didn't listen to his parents.
I don't want Tom in there.
Let's go get some burgers.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
Did you talk to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary said.
This isn't a place for a three-year-old.
I can ski.
He built a new house.
I didn't expect you.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom went to Boston last week.
I'm sleeping all the time.
I'm getting weak.
The cake looks nice.
Did someone break your heart?
That's how I feel.
What's the matter with you?
We want to see Tom.
Where'd you go, Tom?
Who won the prize?
Please, come here in time.
The Germans have a weak attitude toward the goal.
Now we can't help her.
Please don't move.
You can't deny that.
Tom won't come back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister's asleep.
Dan visited the restaurant last summer.
Is that why you don't want to help us?
When their leader died, they put his body in a large grave.
Women like men with mustaches.
Did you forget your wallet again?
Do you accept a kiss?
I want to know if Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't do that, then who?
I wish I could be like Tom.
Suddenly, I heard a loud noise.
They both woke up.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much money do you think I can get for a kidney?
I told you to open the door.
I didn't expect that.
Can you deliver this?
I wasn't lucky at all.
His body was raised with a brown fur.
Tom didn't want Mary to cry.
I got really mad at Tom.
The week is seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know that sounds naive.
Now get in.
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm the one who'll help him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The inhabitants of the island are friendly.
Let's try Tom first.
I've always loved secret characters more.
Drop my ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm anemic.
I voted for you.
I want to eat pineapple for breakfast.
I thought I'd tell you.
What's the gate for?
Tom is one of the most prominent American singers.
It can't be a coincidence.
Is that necessary?
Don't bother Tom.
Tom will never come back here again.
Nobody wants to cry.
She was crying for a toy.
He tried to climb the remote mountain.
I missed the game.
It was just a joke.
I'd do it if I could.
Tom's really fucked.
Try to explain it to Tom.
We got here first.
I already gave her your number.
The soap burned my eyes.
It's good to see you all again.
Tom loved Mary very much.
Tom tried the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started talking.
I'm happy to help.
It's all very informal.
This is not the right way.
I know I can do more.
You're learning fast.
We ate very nice food.
Tom's been unemployed for three months.
Tom can't offer much.
I was kicked out.
No one's gonna bother you.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't even know you had one.
Look out the window.
Mary buys smelly garbage bags.
I'm suffering from asthma.
He's used to working in the garden two hours a day.
Tom rarely comes out.
Tom caught malaria while traveling to Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where Tom hid the diamonds?
Is everything there?
Tom ran out of his passport.
You deserve a medal.
They're strong.
How did you make such a mistake?
It's good to remember.
Can he do anything he wants to do?
It's time to say good-bye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really hot.
We've got bad news for them.
We should go home.
Tom hit me.
I planned to vote for him.
Tom was the only one in the room who didn't know French.
Why did you go there?
Clean it up.
Tom's still not quite aware of what happened.
Cocaine is a drug.
This is a little hard.
Looks like you already know the answer.
Could you take us?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood robbed the rich.
Tom didn't leave.
Who owns the ship?
Yeah, and?
I asked where Tom is.
It was of great benefit to us.
What do you usually do at leisure?
I'll come and save you.
I got a rock in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We fucked up.
Who made the doll?
I didn't lose hope for a moment.
Her long hair was boneless coffee.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please give him a chance.
I'm never looking for my hands.
I didn't tell anyone, not even your mother.
Don't come into my room.
We're just getting started.
I didn't want to thank you.
There was no need to talk.
My jaw hurts.
Tom wanted Mary to go to the post office with him.
What's his point?
I want someone else.
Don't talk.
They may need our help.
I got a couple of donuts.
I'm learning French.
I don't see you.
It was too late.
I live on the lowest floor.
Girls won't play tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I've been mindless.
Mary broke up our friendship.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to make them stop.
I enjoyed Tom's sensitivity.
We need to call Tom.
They're gonna hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You won't need that.
One day I went to walk in the woods.
Let's leave him a little alone.
I never wear clothes.
The beam's broken.
He's gone.
His clientele is made up of mostly poor people.
None of us were right.
Find the differences.
That's terrible.
Why do you mind?
Tom says he wants to do it, too.
Women like men with mustaches.
We spent the afternoon fooling ourselves on the beach.
I don't care about them.
People die all the time.
He's too perfect for him.
Can you make that stop?
Call me if there's a problem.
He's ruining his clothes.
He drew his sword.
I can't wait to go to Boston.
Tom doesn't like to go.
Tom seems a little depressed this morning.
No one understood me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where he was.
Tom's got his brain pounded.
Tom died a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss that with you.
Did you ask for their money?
Don't talk so loud.
She works at the bank.
Death, whatever form it is, is disgusting.
Do you want to vote?
The more danger, the more honor.
We should've bought another bottle of wine.
Add the chromium.
We're old friends.
Tom took out his hat and politely gave presents.
That's one reason.
Give me my book back, I need it again.
Marco thinks he's writing.
Tom looked.
My ears are ringing.
I use the opportunity to thank her.
Tom's not very well.
Don't listen to him!
Can I say something?
You're such a jerk!
Who makes him breakfast?
I don't understand this song.
They call me Captain.
Tom's complicated.
Tom didn't want to kneel.
Tom was suspended.
They were laughing.
She'll become a teacher.
I don't mean to tell Tom that.
I'd like marined fish and seafood.
I was terrible.
Tom seems upset.
Something's weird.
You're not that old, Tom.
Did you become an angel?
That is all we know about them.
Do you think that's what stopped us?
Maybe we can find help in the nearest village.
We hope it's okay.
You're capable, but you're suffocating.
She worked at an embassy three months ago.
Now we're out.
Maybe we'll have a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll get them.
Tom got violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this alone.
Is anyone surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him as much as I can.
Tom's mad.
It's from work.
We'll handle it.
Commendation motivates students to work better.
Tom's not very photogenic.
Tom unlocked the door from the car.
I don't agree with that.
Stop spending my money.
Tom's about 30 years old.
What's the matter?
I see how upset you are.
Okay, I'll order it.
We'll figure it out.
I can make you a deal.
He's on his way.
Dan was attacked by two.
Tom measured his weight.
Something must have happened to Tom.
Tom's had a lot of change since last year.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
Tom raised his nose.
Tom seems a little shaken.
He's fucked up.
I'm just so proud of you.
At that time, the title "lady" was used only for noblemen.
Tom's been learning French for years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak for yourself.
Do you believe that?
How to choose a man only one?
I came to feed Tom's fish.
Actually, I came to help you.
I don't feel it.
My uncle's farm was there, spread out on the bloody bed, with a dagger rolled deep into the heart.
Someone is trying to kill us.
They pay me to clean Tom's garage.
You can rest.
It couldn't be safer.
How long will you stay with us?
You must be very proud.
You used to be so funny.
Could you stay a little longer?
Don't talk to anyone.
She licked the spoon.
I'm just thinking out loud.
You're specific.
You should give him some space.
You almost missed Tom.
Where's the mailbox?
I'm listening to your kid laugh.
Tom suspects Mary and I are cooking something.
Just leave us alone.
Tom's pretty skinny.
Tom usually wins in disputes.
You can handle this.
Did you hear the thunders go off?
Don't mix up work and pleasure.
I'm working in Boston now.
He put a crown on the king's head.
Tom kept his breath.
Tom was busy with work.
I'll meet you.
I'm glad you're okay.
Your patent has been unlocked.
This is one of mine.
There's nothing to stop.
Tom's sweating.
Tom got off the couch.
Don't be mad at Tom.
I turned on the fan and directed it to the wall.
This is a domestic jam.
Tom asked Mary for help.
There are no examples.
Just give me one day.
The police found Tom's body in a platoon grave behind the pool.
Tom writes very well.
That's not exactly true.
The rats are small.
Please stay close.
We're done talking.
I brought you water.
Let him lie like a dog.
I'm tired of Boston.
Tom had a severe headache.
As soon as he got older, his heart stopped.
It's probably hard.
They're locked in.
Tom was driving to the back seat.
The bank borrowed a million dollars from the company.
I still have a lot to tell you.
I always write.
What are the conditions?
Will you stay, Tom?
I know what is important to you, and I will do all I can to destroy it.
Play relaxed.
My son always interrupts me while I'm talking.
Tom's calling.
I'll drive myself.
Looks like yesterday I had too much to drink, I don't care, I'm really hungover.
Tom was having a good time.
Tom said he didn't know his name.
I'm gonna grab your baby.
It was pretty funny.
Tom closed the door.
I'm interested in sports.
I have a surprise for her.
Do you have to borrow me an interesting book?
Tom was moving carefully.
Just get inside.
He took a sword out of the steel.
I moved into a new house last week, and yesterday I studied the library.
I told myself.
You're funny.
Is that all we need?
Tom cut his nose off.
When will I see you?
I promise I won't do anything to hurt you.
Tom's one.
The woman calls the man.
Tom really found something interesting.
Theirs had a lot more of them than we did.
It'll be all right.
I can't believe you.
What did Tom want to see?
I'm so scared.
The day's angry.
I don't even know what it is.
I'm not calling them.
I'm not sure where to put this.
Tom couldn't bear it anymore.
It's hard to explain.
What's their aim?
I'll send him to stay with you.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
I couldn't let Tom die.
Did they put Tom in the hospital?
You'll feel better.
The rules are here.
This is the pool Tom learned to swim in.
Tom cut the apple in half.
Don't you want to play tennis?
There's something under the table.
You can't leave Boston today.
Tell Tom to wait for me in front of the mail.
What college did you go to?
It's about integrity.
Please don't let go of my hand.
I'd better call him again.
Tom's not very funny.
Tom knows too much.
Are you the new assistant?
Don't mess with Tom.
He was doing a lot more than I expected.
Clear your eyes.
Tom just got inside.
You broke my blood right now in my eye.
That's where Mary visited yesterday.
She's going through it!
There's a son who's gone missing.
I'm trying to work.
What kind of taste do you want?
Let's talk about Tom.
I have a feeling that the show will give up; they didn't sell a lot of cards.
Tom's on his way.
Tom doesn't think he should use deodorance.
Does Tom swim a lot?
The girl's asleep.
Go write at home.
Don't force the child to eat.
I'd like to ask you about them.
You're laughing.
Tom paid me.
It's my concern to read books.
They killed him.
Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted to have a lot of kids.
Tom seems so upset.
Go to sleep, Tom.
Tell me the details.
Tom was very warm.
We must always support our children.
Everyone has their own flaws.
Tom was sitting behind the wheel.
What do we do with them?
Tom knew what he was planning on cooking for Mary for dinner.
What are you looking at here?
I have the impression that it's been raining all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom look upset?
They'll probably come by car.
Thank you.
You already got a new boyfriend.
Although Jane had a case less than I did, they complained that she had too much to carry.
I really miss them.
You're terrible.
Where does he live at all?
Mary's a real expert.
Excuse me for a moment.
I don't think I want to do that right now.
I can't sleep with the light on.
There's too much acid in the orange.
Tom came to help.
It's been too long.
I had a crack in the name of Cookie.
Tom's on a business trip.
Tom said he'd land the buffoon.
Do you know how that could have happened?
I'll write you a note.
You're very lonely.
Please don't add any comments.
That was Tom's only flaw.
Do you remember what you were wearing when I met you?
The mollusks usually join the thunderstorms.
Tom wants some tea with his roommate.
I know his address.
Tom knew Mary.
Can I come with Tom?
Tom seems nervous.
I have a little temperature.
Tom put it on the ground.
This lecture isn't over!
The glasses are in the glass credential.
Give us some time.
Tom was wondering why Mary didn't want to fuck him.
Excuse us for a moment.
Maybe it's time for a change.
You should wear a helmet while you drive a motorcycle.
We're worried about him.
Tom's British.
John and Eve are best friends.
I'm as strong as you are.
Tom wanted to dance.
She called the psychiatrist.
How can you stay awake?
Everyone knows I hate her.
He's incapable of doing that.
Tom didn't have the courage to try to do it again.
Not all aliens are bad.
They made love.
I burned the waste.
We both saw him.
That would be uncultural.
Tell us where they are.
Tom's a famous conductor.
After the storm, the ocean was calm.
I think I'd better help them.
One of my friends is studying abroad.
In tropical areas, there are only two years.
I think I made myself clear.
I'm replacing her.
Look at the clock.
Isn't this wonderful?
Tom said Mary was down here.
Why'd you draw a face on the wall?
Do you think about them?
Actually, I'm back with my ex-boyfriend.
Just do this thing.
I think Tom's beautiful.
Tom got a little pie.
What's Tom looking for?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom said he knows how to play tennis, but he doesn't.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
What does the sign say over the door?
Sit down.
I was thinking about your problem with Tom.
The hair and the way you keep your head remind me of Mary.
Don't block my way.
We're looking for them now.
My shoes are soaked.
Tom would've come back.
She's always worth it.
What state are you a citizen of?
Trade in elephant bones is illegal.
I've always wanted to travel with Mary.
I'll meet Tom.
I prefer cats to cats.
There is still little space in the closet.
Thank you, Tom.
Mary's been painting her hair for years.
That wasn't funny.
Tom doesn't know how to swim yet.
That's usually not a good idea.
How many languages do you speak?
I know you cared a lot about Tom.
I was home.
I should've asked her first.
Tom's the father.
You know what I need.
It doesn't hold on to this heat.
Looks like these two are calming down.
Unfortunately, I can't let that happen.
I need you urgently.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We didn't even have a broken money.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I did this for you.
You were brave, weren't you?
I can do better than that.
I didn't want it like that.
Did Tom do anything?
I see you're awake.
Keep doing your job.
When are you closing?
We want to help them.
I'll bring Tom with me.
I'm lonely, you can say.
Can not get message: %s %s
Looks like we're gonna have to try harder.
Shouldn't we go looking for her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to his party?
I'm looking for them now.
I can't tell you what you want to know.
They're both good.
What are you looking for mother in Boston?
At first, I didn't understand anything.
I went to the bathroom with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I'm still worried about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree's floating.
We'll keep in touch.
We're almost together.
That's my plan.
Tom heard Mary call John.
Put your hands together.
I don't want to bother him.
Tom never sits long.
Go with the sticks.
I thought Tom was sick.
Everyone was talking.
I'm so proud of you.
Tom was looking for the drawers in the kitchen.
Many people in Africa have died as a result of the storm.
What did you put on?
I'm gonna get over you.
This is Tom's picture.
Can you call her?
By the way.
Then the forest was quiet.
Don't run away from me now.
I have every disease.
She was depressed.
We're playing with fate.
I thought he had bigger tits.
Maybe I'll be ready to go soon.
Tom doesn't know how to feel.
There's some more tea in the teapot.
I must have parked my car somewhere else.
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
I was nervous by the storm.
This is justified.
I didn't even know you didn't like Tom.
I know some things.
Was it just a dream?
I'm too excited to get to Pluto soon.
"I see," the blind man said.
Everyone laughed at me on the beach.
Tom turned into a pop.
I'd like to see a warrant.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
Tom said he lived here before.
Why is Tom like that?
I have problems with the sines.
I had low expectations of him.
I was really curious.
I told Tom to tell you that.
Tom's running out of water.
Esperanto doesn't belong to anyone.
She's handing a chicken.
Turn it off.
I don't share my real name on any website.
They threw out the plan.
I don't want to lie.
"Time is not money." "Time is life."
Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I've got three Chads.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very beautiful.
The police are looking for me.
Tom's not that tall.
It's been a week, up and down.
He's slowly recovering from the disease.
I want a vortex.
He's too old to go fast.
Tom seemed really angry.
Let Tom talk.
I know you still love Tom.
Get away from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How do I get Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of them could be her.
I'm taking you to school.
The fly's on the roof.
Her face was tortured with sperm.
Tom's just right.
You have to do this first.
We met around noon.
I'm not doing anything tonight.
Get him a drink.
Thank you.
Thank you for telling me.
That's an order, Tom.
It's from the Bible.
We're eating apples.
Is that moral?
Do you know what that looks like?
Pretend you won.
I'm so confused.
They were waiting outside.
He was ugly and irresponsible, so he was ordered to leave the company.
I'd understand what's going on with you.

I wish you a nice week!
Do you still want to go to a zoo on Monday?
One is life.
How many people are there in the house?
Tom needs to go now.
Why did God make me so ugly?
Why are you blaming them?
Get over it.
We're acting childish.
Tom was a boson.
Tom would enjoy this.
Tom, get up there.
Let's go outside and talk.
Alcohol is the answer, but I still don't know what the question was.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You're all the same.
Look what started now.
We're a team!
We agreed to help them.
You can't sell it.
Sheika dropped the tire.
We made ourselves a tree.
This is much better.
I'm gonna make her take off your lawn.
Tom's a math guy.
Tom pulled his money from the bank.
I just wanted to help Tom.
You have to sit down.
The harder it is, the better.
You can rest.

Tom was always stubborn.
You make bread in your ovens.
You're a brute.
Your sons are pretty handsome.
I know how much that's worth.
Call me if you find her.
We ate lobster and straw.
You have to forgive me.
The girl went to school despite her illness.
Tom tried to help me.
They knocked on the door.

She decided not to pay the fine.
I admire them.
My car's in the back.
Tom wanted to find out where Linda was last night.
That's so terrible.
I'll get her home.
We gave them an apple.
I can't argue with that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I don't have any benefit from that.
It's still not working.
Give me an example.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
In case this happens again, call me.
Were you honest?
Filjan was empty.
Don't talk.
You're busy, aren't you?
They won't give up.
They're getting close.
Mom and Dad won't come with me.
The vampire lived in a dead coffin.
No, I'm not mad at you.
She's our neighbor.
I'm done with my job.
We'll deal with them.
Please, move quickly.
I'm too young to die.
I hate opera.
I'll call someone.
Where should these documents be handed over?
Tom has a bruise in his eye.
Tom's firm is under threat.
Have you ever done that?
Maybe Tom's wrong.

I couldn't call you.
Is it true?
I know you're angry.

If I shower with hot water, the mirror in the bathroom is clouded.
Tom was painting.
Tom thought Mary was gonna be at Tom's party.
You're the only one who can laugh at me.
Unfortunately, I don't have enough money on me right now.

Did you see his face?
I don't speculate.
It's just wrong.

Would you like a dog?
We'll always be here.
I didn't know your father died.
They raised my salary again.
I'll never get there again.
I'm filming.

What do we do today?
Do you believe in a horoscope?
I know I'm going.
I'm contributing.
It was a real disaster!
Tom's good at his profession.
I thought about it.
I'd like to know why they deleted my name from the list.
Tom has arranged all of this.
I'm not gonna betray her.
Flowers attract bees.
The water is soft.
Pretto, there was no plant life in this climate.
You're incapacitated.

Who are we?
It was worth a try.
I did the right thing.
Tom's very far away.
Tom wants to write.
Tom is very practical.
I can't say for sure.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
Let's ask them something else.
Why isn't Tom's name on the list?
Yeah, well?
I have a lot of interest in learning Chinese.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
I can't give him these.
I'm not taught that.
She's got tight hips.
I don't waltz.
Maybe Tom doesn't tell the truth.
Will you vote for him?
The famous critic and poet travel together.
There's no time to explain.
Are they going to arrest me?
Unfortunately, that violates all the rules.
Why aren't you home?
You have to resign.
We tried to get them to tell us.
Come on, beer.
Some Mr. Kimura is waiting for you on the line.
Men and women are people of the opposite sex.
That's mostly true.
I know Tom didn't play fair.
The wound was released to the gnoo.
No, and it's not even under the chair.
I'm a little drunk.
Can we talk to you?
Tom couldn't hold back.
Tom covered his head with a pillow.

Tom still doesn't speak French very well.
Mary was in Hungary.
They're strangers.
Moral choice is for the translator whether to translate something or not.
You're disgusting.
Tom avoids Mary when he can.
Before you do that, you should ask Tom for permission.
You look beautiful.
Think about what you want.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
Do I look normal?
Are you going to eat?
I need a box of kids.
I did it.
Take a look.
Give me the French key.
Tom seems upset.
It was a ambush.
Tom and Mary know what happened.
We just hired Tom.
Tom won the lottery.
I was impressed by Tom's courtesy.
Tom has no hope.
Tom's wearing glasses.
I'll keep working here as long as I can.
Who do you know in Boston?
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
There was a big crowd at the party.
Because the orbit is oval, the distance between the planets and the sun is constantly changing.
Tom just told me.
Tom looked Mary deep in his eyes and laughed.
It was very boring in that room, because all the windows were closed.
Tom could get hurt.
It's all right.
The stars are shining.
Really?
I can touch the floor with my hands without turning my knees.
Tom's a white man.
Tom could do better.
I didn't call you for that, Tom.
Maybe it's too late.
To find them.
I couldn't sleep too much.
That's good enough for him.
Tom's home.
You'll be known in time.
I don't know.
Tom was brutally killed on October 20, 2013.
I thought you were in Boston.
I don't think we should wait anymore.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
That woman had a child.
I really like you.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
You shouldn't write more than 400 words.
With a friend like you, I don't need enemies.
That's why I brought you here.
We can have lunch on the bus.
Tom told me not to.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
You're squirting.
We're gonna go shopping.
Tom knew Mary would like John.
Tom's dark.
I just cut my finger.
I'm gonna go ask Tom.
My head hurts.
I wouldn't recommend that.
We only have one life.
Why does Tom have to go?
Would you lie to me?
He's got a passive character.
Someone might have followed her.
My wife was here once.
It's a cure right.
We went down the coast.
I don't want you to abuse them.
Depends on your decision.
That's feasible.
Tom's reacting badly.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
Tom was thinking about you.
It's not attractive.
Few people understand that.
You're very cut out.
Aren't you a banker?
She was delighted to meet her lawyer.
That's our best chance.
It smells like flowers.
Tom's screwed up.
I asked them to turn around.
I trust the teacher.
Tom's a fire extinguisher and he's started to spray.
She's a tennis player.
I wasn't even in Boston the night Tom was killed.
I need you for a second.
Have as much fun as you can!
Whose are these?
Talk on your behalf.
It's been going through a lot of trouble.
She slowly developed a hatred for me.
I don't think that's what it's all about.
I don't cry when I'm happy.
So we agreed?
I'd like to help him prove it.
Your arguments are illogical to me.
Tom seems indecisive.
I asked them to leave.
He was waiting for her.
Tom can't hold back.
I'll never forget her.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or I'm wrong.
My computer's stuck.
My grandmother lived with us.
We'll be right there.
You forgot your backpack!
And so the conscience really makes us all cowards.
There's no need to panic.
I gave him one of those.
I don't expect anything less than perfection.
I think that hotel will be a little expensive for you.
Tom's picking up the box.
I should have checked.
He couldn't take off his pants.
I don't need to convince them.
What are you drinking?
Tom didn't want to help me.
You're wrong.
It's good to see you.
Now you're allowed to leave, sir.
Maybe it's him.
You're ready to cry.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
Tom visited Boston.
The screen emits green light.
The English became my favorite object.
Things happened fast.
Where's the evidence?
When we woke up this morning, we faced terrible news.
The knee wound is now rotting.
Clear your eyes.
Mary was scared.
It's none of your business!
Tom wouldn't do anything.
Tom's an agricultural worker.
We helped them once.
Tom seems to be enjoying himself.
Maybe Tom will hear you.
Since when does Tom sleep?
Our job is to help them.
He suffered great losses.
Tom just needs a little rest.
What are you eating, anyway?
Promise me you'll help us.
I'll stay in the car.
Would you like some menthol candy?
Why would Tom do that to us?
I don't even want to know.
They'll do it.
I'll have to spend the night here.
I almost cut myself.
I'll get down here.
We're paranoid.
This isn't silver.
Blood now broke into his brain.
How many spare keys do you have for the car?
Is that your mother?
Tom wasn't the man you could easily agree with.
I don't want pork.
She wants to run.
I need a sea turtle.
This was a crime of preconceived intent.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
Tom reads the note.
The kids drew pictures on the sidewalk with a chalk.
You wonder what you've been holding back so long.
Did you get an answer from him?
I need to take her home.
These nuns live in the monastery.
I went to Boston twice.
Tom's married to 26 years.
We've already cleared it.
You want me to pick you up from the airport?
We're playing with the computer.
No, it's not even under the chair.
Tom and I are drinking friends.
I didn't see the spirit.
I just don't think it's appropriate.
Tom knows he's listening.
Tom always tries to do what he thinks is right.
Tom apparently doesn't often understand what's going on.
Come visit us in the near future.
Did you have breakfast today?
What's this about?
She invited me to dinner.
She wants to miss out on the magnificent mirrors in the house.
I'm not a local.
What do you got in the bowl?
Tom can't find Mary.
You know what's going on right now.
Tom refused to tell us what happened.
You smell like shit.
Who's your favorite nail polish?
I'm studying piano.
They need the money.
It's a good swim.
You won't find us.
I heard from her.
You don't get involved in this.
Thank you for giving me as much time as I needed to finish this.
I watched TV when Tom came.
You're not following.
Do you think you can stop me?
Actually, it's very common.
I decided to forgive them.
I know you know.
Didn't I do something to get Tom mad at me?
The triangles don't have four angles.
There's not enough light here to read.
Tom's counting on Mary.
Tom was just listening.
Mary opened the carmine.
Let me guess.
Tom's ashamed of me.
Guess what you told me.
When did you buy that from us?
Let this stay between us.
That's where I asked.
I'll talk.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everyone's waiting for her.
It could be risky.
I'm a teacher too.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
Your moon's coming back.
Tom's wearing John's shirt.
He found his parents.
He gave us a dubious answer.
Wake me up as soon as they break up.
Mr. Gorbachev, break down the wall!
Tom seems surprised.
Tom's on the line.
That's what it's supposed to be.
Let's try and agree.
That's gonna be hard.
I don't like retirement.
Thank you for asking.
I have a good reason not to love Tom.
That gave me an idea.
Can I start eating?
I'll investigate it right away.
These shoes are hers.
Let him call me.
The rooms are abandoned.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter should not have been sent at all.
The girl who wears a joke is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks old?
This puppet is my only friend.
My lawyer's coming.
I don't think Tom's gonna fight much.
What are you making?
I'll call him right away.
That's our secret.
Dan gave Linda money for abortion.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
What were your teachers like?
We had meetings.
Tom'll be back in a few minutes.
The prince inherited the throne.
You won't find me.
Are those my glasses?
I know that for sure.
I've never felt so loved.
I can't control it.
She's driving me crazy.
I'll be back in time.
It's nothing urgent.
I'll collect it now.
If you kiss me, I'll be happy.
I don't care about all of you.
I'll come by subway.
I didn't get an answer from them.
Tom's not really my favorite.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom's coming.
Tom's married to Mary last year.
Tom goes to school with a car.
Did you see?
I'll have to think this through carefully.
I'll buy a calendar.
Everyone's talking about me.
Do you ever think about us?
Do you write the words?
It was a great show.
We need to go find them.
Last time I was home on Friday night when I was 13 years old.
Tom knows Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Take off your hat.
I don't know what you think will change.
I'm doing it for him.
She can be trusted.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
What did Tom find now?
We stayed up all night trying to figure out a plan.
Tom's still angry.
Tom's going to sleep.
To protect our peace!
Tom's well armed.
We were worried.
I forgot to tell you when the meeting starts.
I forgot my passport.
Tom said to stay here.
I'm not armed.
Do you hate them so much?
We need to buy him a gift.
I know what happened at school today.
I have a glass of beer to satisfy my thirst.
Tom's here in time.
It's boring TV today.
Oh, great!
Tom found a kid with four leaves.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Tom seems really sad.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
You can't take that from me.
Please look at me.
She quit smoking.
Tom found the evidence.
We got to say hello to them.
Didn't you smoke?
All visitors must be examined.
Where'd you get that scar?
You're nobody and nothing.
We won't find them.
The association was founded in 1990.
Isn't that dangerous?
This sounds quite valid.
It's a law!
The water is tearing down the stone.
You should ask Tom.
Please write that down.
Tom's safe.
I can stay.
I don't see customers complaining.
Here, I want challenges.
He's not sitting on the bench.
I should have done it yesterday.
We're very similar to Tom.
Tom's not my cousin.
Watch out for the fireflies that fly from the fire.
It's just made up.
Tom was silent to Mary all night.
Tom wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
I dream of you all the time.
Let's find out more about her.
I won't tell anyone your secret unless you tell me I'm laughing.
Let's gather the soul.
I'm sure he'll put in the next test.
Let's go to Boston.
Tom's a good dad.
Stay here, okay?
Don't you know it's hopeless?
He's passionately kissed her in the mouth.
Tom went to the store and bought three bags of bug spray.
It was disgusting.
You don't owe me anything.
Tom turned into a werewolf.
I bought these drugs for my father.
Children love cake.
He was quite restrained.
I can end up with Tom.
Tom's getting mad.
This is from us.
In an emergency, what number should I call?
I still want a horse.
I didn't even touch him.
Who's in charge here?
He confessed he had to lie.
Mary collected all the money from Tom.
Enough of the crap.
Otherwise, Mike, please tell me how to get to you.
Tom always wanted a son.
Tom has a big mouth.
That looks like tea.
Tom has asthma.
Tom started knocking.
The peppers are beautiful.
I didn't bring them.
Maybe it won't be as hard as you think it will be.
We'd like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom came out of work early.
We have everything.
I made him these cookies.
When does the school year end?
You're right from the start.
How did you do that without our help?
Why didn't you say "bye"?
How many instruments can you play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last one.
I haven't found them yet.
They're ignoring me.
Hold on to the fence.
These must be fakes.
Beauty cannot be determined objectively but depends on personal aesthetic criteria.
Tom is unmistakable.
His girlfriend's weakened.
Between me and Tom, it's over.
Tom didn't know who Mary's parents were.
Did I invite you?
Tom's always here.
You left me in despair.
Tom screaming out of the nightmare.
Tom's got a weak look.
The twin didn't work, so he couldn't paint in the dark.
We agreed to start right away.
Is it over?
Everyone wants lasting peace.
We met the other day.
Where's Tom's stuff?
Is the coffee hot?
Tom put his eyes out.
The tribe was not too happy for a peacemaker to come.
Open up.
Put on a chair.
You could be wrong.
I also baked the cake.
Tom has a plantation.
Why is Tom still in school?
It was an honor.
I talked to my counselors about what items to take.
I had already written everything I needed to write.
Make sure you don't worry about me.
We can rest.
Boston is worth seeing.
There's no one in the school now.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe Tom was the one who stole Mary's wheel.
Is Dan aware of what he did?
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
I'll say whatever you want.
Tom has no friends.
Who lives in this room?
I want you back here.
Tom wants you to do it so he doesn't have to do it himself.
I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom's a nice man.
I never change my sleeping schedule.
So, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the bench.
Guys, come here.
Have you seen him?
Tom wasn't sure about anything.
What do you think of her?
What's the worst thing that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you saw here.
Come on, I'll carry you.
I set Tom up.
You must be confused.
Mary whispers something in Tom's ear.
Tom knows he's very vindictive.
I've seen it go.
We're gonna miss Tom a lot.
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't do anything like that before.
You're so stupid.
I thought I'd mention it.
Is Dadbea really very slow today, or do I think?
Did you ask Google for me?
Emotions are contagious.
I was just showering.
Tom's probably in the kitchen.
Tom's back with him.
That's what you need.
I fell in love with you.
We're modeled.
What do you want?
Tom's got a new job.
Tom won't be back before dinner.
Tom betrayed you.
I need to pack.
That responsibility for him is a burden.
Tom's still playing golf, isn't he?
I've had breakfast today.
My pop music is my favorite kind of music.
Half an hour passed.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
That was amazing.
I can't see anything.
He's quite an unpleasant man!
They blew up the tent on the beach.
I didn't want that at all.
It's better to be alone.
I have to warn Tom.
The two brothers are musicians.
Tom seems jealous.
Tom took the picture off the wall and stuck another one in that place.
Stop!
Do you want cheese?
I'll call you.
He's getting tired fast.
It's different now.
Are we ready to leave?
Cows are never clear.
That was very rude by Tom.
It's dumb.
I'm helping Tom with something.
I'm mad.
Let's get you kicked.
Sequencing is energy consumption.
Tom went to rehab.
They'll pay well.
Tom's probably out.
We didn't fight.
Tom looked inside.
At the same time, you are difficult and easy, and pleasant and bitter; I can't live without you.
Let's just say for now that you're right.
Tom's doing great.
I don't hear anything.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
No one's worried about that.
I'll see you later.
It's hot here.
That's what disappointed him.
Don't talk about us.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in the city.
You have to try, Tom.
I wish I understood.
Tom's a coward.
I guess most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
You've been thanking us.
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do that.
They all look like each other.
Don't forget it.
We have to find them first.
I'm keeping an account.
Tom hit Mary on the head with a table.
Tom's gonna kill you.
We'd better both get some sleep.
I always mix those two names.
Tom's wearing a jacket.
I found a place to live.
I need a musical instrument.
This report is very fussy.
You need to help them.
Tom didn't even cry.
You wrote a book, and that's great.
Tom turned the hook.
I hope this is good.
If they lied about it, then we have a much bigger problem.
I'm looking at ghosts.
I was tired and I was cold.
Nothing is sad about stupidity and indifference.
They're all cashing.
Tom wasn't protesting.
What's the point of the website?
Vampires live forever.
They both laughed.
What do you got in your hand?
She's a young student.
They're sympathetic.
I hate slippers.
I didn't say I did it.
Dan wants to be a dictator.
It's been spending all day cleaning up the snow.
His paralysis is getting worse and soon, he won't be able to get out of bed.
Do you want to run?
I need Tom.
Changes are never easy.
Is it far from Boston?
They're paying me to help you.
My jacket's too small.
I got fired.
I asked Tom if he could prepare that by 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I don't mind.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you happy just as you want to make me happy.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom went to Boston with a plane.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
We're very efficient.
Please don't vote for her.
I'll take care of it later this afternoon.
Tom bought a paper and read it on the train while he was going to work.
You're very direct.
Tom pulled the tape out of the bottle.
And Tom will be there.
A guard is coming.
I can't confirm that.
Don't let me wait!
Tom gave me the picture that's stuck on the lock.
The pigeons symbolize peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
Traitor!
I'll do anything for humanity's good.
Did you really stay home all night?
Annie's music is beautiful.
Is she a cab driver?
I'm sure I'm losing my hearing.
Now it's over.
He's sleeping with me.
It's not scientifically proven that there's a connection between the character and the blood group.
She sounded angry.
Honestly, Tom wasn't trying hard enough.
It's from England.
Is there anyone who doesn't agree?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom's brave.
Avoid smoking too much.
Tom's a hairdresser.
I pressed the button to turn the radio on.
We're playing on a computer.
Maybe you're right.
What are you holding?
This is a product for men.
We've been looking all over for them.
I really like your website.
I'll catch you.
Push this button.
Tom's really capable of fighting.
What's really bothering her?
Do you have the keys?
Tom's tearing his car apart.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
Tom didn't want to break Mary's heart.
All the lizards carry eggs.
We'll take something.
I think Tom is cruel.
You didn't answer my letter.
We calmed down.
You look disoriented.
The bread boils in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad.
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I see how things are.
I'm making very stupid decisions.
Let's move to that table.
Wait a second.
I just got a message from them.
Where's your family?
Where's Tom heading?
This is very similar to mine.
I just ate, so I'm not hungry.
Please, get out.
His words sound reasonable.
There are many rivers in India.
Why don't we meet at 2:30?
I can't ask Tom for more money.
Tom wants adventures.
They don't have a dump.
Many trees have fallen.
Lions don't make a difference in colors.
That wasn't true.
The answer's fucked up.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're so far from home.
Friendships last longer than memories.
Look this way.
I want you to pay my money back right now.
Tom believed Mary was innocent.
He's too proud.
I'm having a really nice time here in Vancouver.
Maybe we shouldn't try to do this without Tom's help.
Can I help you?
Tom and I are married now.
I guess we both lied.
I was happy here.
Only a few passengers survived the accident.
I can imagine you getting married to Tom.
Tom seems polite.
Tom wants to know what Mary's doing in Boston.
I missed you so much.
I'm inferior to you.
I'll quote a passage from one of those letters.
Tom noticed he didn't have his wallet.
The woman was sitting between two men.
Why do cows survive?
I'm runnin' through the groove on my right ear.
The cartons are bleeding.
My stomach hurts after meals.
We're really in danger.
Tom never told me he didn't speak French.
These don't get names.
It's fair.
I'm here to teach.
I forgot to tell you about them.
Tom promised to stay in his room.
Mounting the calendar on the wall.
I really missed you.
I love you more than anyone has ever loved you.
We packed their bags.
Why couldn't you sleep last night?
They don't throw a curse at us.
Did you get Tom's invitation?
Just turn it around.
You can't deny that.
That would be very funny.
This is for your own good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.
Maybe I could talk to Tom.
What is the text about?
Tom wrote a letter to Mary and thanked her for her help.
I decided to go.
They eat sandwiches.
The frogs have lived for a long time.
Tom's a strong man.
Tom's sleeping very hard.
Are you helping him?
Looks like she's drunk.
You can talk later.
Get her a drink.
Yeah, I got it.
Did you get here by car?
I don't know the end of the story.
We're done.
I'm sure.
Will you wait a minute?
You're between friends.
Something's weakened for me.
I know you don't speak French.
Did you call?
The question is who will make that decision.
They'll find him.
Start again.
It was a warm night.
Thank you for receiving me.
Susan's actually your half sister.
I told Tom about you.
Tom, do you still love me?
I'd rather be a subterranean egg.
Can you explain that?
Where's his house?
Love is for crazy people.
Why would you help him?
Tom's got his shoes on.
We've lost faith in humanity.
Tom shakes hands with the manager.
I was actually born in Boston.
And how am I to blame for that?
Why do all of us hate one another?
Tom, lend me some money.
Do you mind?
End violence; fight for peace.
Look how I do it.
You're stronger than Tom.
Hold the candle.
Tom understands.
Well, just let me know.
Most plants died.
Hold on, Tom.
You're very helpful.
Tom is still unable to talk to us.
They're gonna be very happy about that.
I'm gay.
Let me see what I can do.
Tom wants cheese.
May I honor you for dinner?
Tom wanted Mary to teach him how to swim.
I should take a look.
Come down, Dick, it's dinner time.
I'm hunting.
He drove fast.
You can use my car.
Just relax.
Tom had a daughter.
Maybe Tom will at least apologize.
He's getting in to the boss.
The next morning, he found a handwritten letter in the mailbox.
Come in.
Does anyone sit here?
I have to cut my expenses this month.
Nobody's talking about us.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
Have you paid already?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom wiped his face off.
How do I benefit from you?
Let's take a closer look.
I love you more.
We don't have to follow her.
It's on me when she's wearing that dress.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
Nothing was funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
Now they live on the floor under this one.
They believed.
I think they saw me.
Tom's parents didn't come to a wedding.
I tried to explain it to him, but he doesn't.
I have to help her.
I already think you're crazy.
The dolphins are kind of boobs.
It's red.
Tom set me up.
Tom may be alive.
Will the future be like a science fiction?
Tom's laughing at you.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
Open the door, even though I told him not to open it.
That narrows the choice.
It's not hard to point out if you're surrounded by fools.
Tom asked us to take care of his child.
I underlined the word "Alice" to highlight it.
Good luck.
We need to get out of here.
This is an airy fat that's popular in the Philippines.
Nobody said anything.
Pursue virtues and give up vices.
You're the smart guy.
I'm against a project.
Wasn't he tired?
I know what the problem is.
Tom was listening to Mary.
I'm a zombie!
I'm too late.
I could have known Tom was really tired.
I never win.
Tom's pretty safe.
There's reports for writing.
It hurts here.
You're alarming Tom.
Where are we headed?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask him.
Just be careful with that.
I was just hitting you.
Tom never showed up again.
My advice would be to get some sleep now and finish tomorrow.
You jumped a button.
Diseases are often reported at the most difficult time.
This dog's staring at me like he wants to eat me.
They were animals dressed in human skin and they were not real people at all.
The man's starving.
Tell him we're busy.
We wanted to talk about him.
Everything is gone, but the beautiful memories remain.
Say what you want.
What do you want to drink?
Tom says he can make any woman fall in love with him.
What did Tom think?
It was really nice.
Everyone's dying sometimes.
I know how to stay calm.
We love beauty.
I've been thinking about it all day.
I suggest we focus on looking for a way out of this cave.
They don't trust me.
Dan wrote Linda another check.
That's right, people!
This building is a magnificent building.
Tom wasn't disappointed.
Do you know how to write?
I think you did it on purpose.
I got this fax from her.
Black cats have bad luck.
Tom told me a secret.
We're flying over the clouds.
I love it so much!
Is this exactly in English?
Let's follow him.
Tom gave Mary a towel.
She's got ears like a sail.
Give her a table.
Where's your school?
Tom was sitting alone.
How's your wife?
Tom didn't know exactly how to answer the question.
This is a ginger drink.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only 18 years old.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom was wondering what Mary would say.
I don't like what it sounds like.
That should be possible.
I'm a social worker.
Let me try.
I'm not incomprehensible.
Tom's safe.
I'll wait for Tom.
I guess you read my report.
Tom's back.
Don't repeat yourself.
The blacks are red.
Maybe we'll find something.
You look really good.
He's been hit by Tom.
Burn it.
Tom seemed to disagree.
What else can Tom do?
I want to become physically and mentally stronger.
She's a lively girl.
If I could stay, I would stay.
Please, stop.
There's no hot water.
I bought you a dragon.
Tom sounded upset.
They're starting to go.
Do you have a map of Boston?
Remember you didn't fall.
"I got nine on the chemistry test, and you?" "The same."
He was lucky they survived the attack.
Tom apparently wasn't in a hurry.
Tom was handsome.
How was the dance?
I'm a student.
That's enough.
I don't understand why Tom wants to go to Boston.
I'll take Tom for a walk.
I don't like it when I'm alone.
I fell in love with you the first day I met you.
You always leave your spot dirty.
He moved here from Mexico five years ago.
Do you have professional experience?
I didn't ask you.
Let's have lunch.
I guess I was a fool to expect you to do something.
You're my pride and joy.
What would you say?
Make two lines.
The titles should draw the reader’s attention.
He was sitting right in front of me.
I'd rather die than obey.
I'm actually working here.
Tom's suffering.
I don't have to call anyone.
I like how you're dressed.
I could stay with you.
That worked.
I was watching a French film with an English translation.
Tom was laughing at Mary.
Tom's back full of self-confidence.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
My mother says the child's diseases are fake.
Dan had a rough relationship with Linda.
Everyone's back.
Do you have any violin?
Give us a call.
Maybe Tom could sing to us at a wedding.
Which one would you choose, Tom?
The hospital isn't that big.
Most people have to work to survive.
Nothing ever changes.
Mary's pregnant.
We'll stay.
I'm not kicking their dog.
I didn't sleep properly.
I don't want to, and I can't serve in a political party.
Girls enter puberty from 10 to 11 years of age, and boys from 11 to 12 years of age.
It's gone.
Tell Tom he can't forget to renew his passport.
The sky will soon be dissolved.
The wall is cold to touch.
He thought someone put the poison in his soup.
A lot of people are doing this.
I still can't tell you.
Mary decided to buy a son's dress.
She was touched.
Epten was cheap.
Marriage scares some people.
Was the door closed?
I've got a big scarf.
Why can't you come?
The inhabitants rebelled against the ruler.
Let's talk to Tom.
He wants strange animals, like snakes.
We need leaders.
His first day at school.
Don't get dressed when you get home.
Tom taught me to sing.
"What book do you read?" "Roman."
You're burning your car.
That gun isn't a toy, boy!
Half of the species is women.
They're staring at him.
That's for them.
That's Tom's dog.
Where's the vodka?
The room smelled bad.
I don't want to hate you.
I have to go again.
What's out there?
I saw her a week ago.
Don't talk to me.
I want to do social work to make up for anything that I have done.
Tom's got them on the tops.
Are you still afraid of spiders?
I don't have any tears.
I still don't understand women.
Is Tom aware?
Tom's beautiful.
This sentence could be interpreted in a number of ways, which I had to take into account when translating.
He's a werewolf.
I knew you'd like that restaurant.
Are the axles poisoned?
The kidnappers tied their eyes.
You're lying, Tom.
Who stole my keys?
Dan invited Linda to a student party.
Mary provided much support.
Tom's in danger now.
I give you my word.
Who's gonna pay the rent?
You're a little rude.
Hey, put that back in place.
I wanted Tom to come.
Does Tom like Mary?
I was waiting for you outside.
I want my money back.
Tom doesn't care.
Tom wanted Mary to take John to the library.
Let's find out who beat Tom.
Tom knows the bonton.
You've seen what I can do.
We have a lot of money.
Does your appearance match your age?
Can I have it?
It is not all honey and milk in Canada.
I have information on this.
Tom was moving.
Do you understand the difference between what is right and what is wrong?
Don't be silly.
I still respect Tom.
Tom wouldn't trust anyone to do that.
He's got a bad look.
That's my specialty.
I'm trying not to secede for you.
I was preparing a speech.
The juices have an old look.
I wrote that to them.
Last year I lived in Boston.
Tom was squeezing.
We want a new carpet.
Let's share a cab.
I don't have to follow him.
Tom was politely smiling.
The teacup's pretty dirty.
You should sleep well.
Tom took down the shed.
They went for a walk.
This is his grandfather from his mother's side.
I want specific information.
Friendships are magical.
The volcano has become active again.
Tom told me he should take care of things.
How will that help?
Dan probably killed Linda by suffocating her.
The little island from far away looks like a turtle.
Are the pastry bites?
What did you ask Tom?
Stop babbling.
I'm thirty years old.
His act in no way is perfect.
They're definitely them.
Don't wait.
You don't know how long you've got.
The dog lied to him.
Let's go to a movie.
Beautiful women are much older than beautiful women.
Tom has sheep.
He's asleep.
Mary feels her face warmed.
I know what's bothering Tom so much.
I thought Tom was retired.
Tom missed it.
Please come with me.
I can't go anywhere.
Stop following them.
Tom's a little shy.
Tell me where Tom is.
I don't mind.
Tell me again what happened.
Tom lifts his jeep without any need.
He deserved better.
Don't give him your number.
Let's do it for her.
I'm not gonna pick up the dragons.
Do you think I care what you think of me?
She's been working for nine.
Can you just go home?
Do you know the right words?
It hurts awfully here.
I hate this carpet.
I'm a little sick.
Tom's been interrupted.
Tom couldn't remember where he left the tent.
Get out of the way.
I'll take my gun.
That's where you belong.
You're not too old for her.
That job's over.
It's unnatural.
What did you steal?
Tom will never finish the job he started.
Tom's a gentleman.
Do you have any pets?
You were wrong about the picture.
I'll get it.
Tom wanted Mary and John to be kind to each other.
Tom's a replacement.
I think I'd better help him.
But you're smart.
Tom said you'd like my help.
You all look so busy.
I was sure we could trust Tom.
Everybody's making a move on him.
Faith means trusting in what reason can’t be hoped for.
Tom was hanging out with me.
Tom was wondering why Mary didn't want to help him.
You've been ruining your whole life.
I couldn't imagine this world without music.
I live nearby.
There's a button on the inside of the door.
Both books are equivalent to value.
We rented a movie.
Smurf's coming back.
Tom filled the trunk to the top.
Pick your weapon.
They chose a new government.
"I'll wash the orchards." "Well, I'll wipe them."
I'd buy it.
He's the one who's pulling back.
We appreciate our customers.
We have to respect the rules.
It's a circus!
Tom's wet.
They asked to raise their salary.
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
Did you know Tom was gonna be here?
The earthquake caused the fire.
Tom's not here today.
If I hadn't eaten, I'd really like to have lunch with you.
What do you need, Tom?
He'd say something.
Grealt stopped working.
I'm talking about him.
Tom knew he'd never see Mary again.
Drop your weapon on the ground.
And see you tomorrow?
I'm the one you want.
We bought them those books.
That's all possible.
I still don't know how to do that.
It's working like a sub-match.
That was a wonderful experience.
Tom hated them.
I want you to let Tom live.
He's a game.
Tom asked me if I liked his plan or not.
The fan doesn't work.
It's not my fault.
I couldn't do anything.
Tom thinks we don't want to go.
We believe in democracy.
You got it?
My day was filled with activity.
Is this yours, Tom?
My dad's suffering from flu.
I haven't been waiting long.
Just look at you.
This is wonderful.
It's not empty in front of both points.
Tom lives on this street.
You should go to a dentist.
Soldiers shot.
Tom can't stand it.
The store's closed.
They've listened.
Tom came out.
This is all I can do.
He adheres to his principles.
Tom's angry.
I'm just here to help him.
Their plan sounds interesting to me.
I still remember the first time I saw you.
They unplugged him.
Tom's a big shot.
Can I put this here?
I didn't see anyone.
I'll take you home.
Tom died of cancer.
How do you think it went?
Tom doesn't believe this at all.
I was wondering about them.
I'm asleep.
I'm planning on going to Boston for Christmas.
Is Tom in Boston?
It boiled like an angle.
You should pay your rent in advance.
Put all the garbage in the storm.
I'd love to drive with Tom.
It's time for that again.
I'm happy to pay you a lot of money to do that.
"Will you think?" "Yes."
I don't own a guitar.
I teach Chinese.
Tom was sitting on the desk.
The ship had three decks.
Tom said he'd never see me again.
Don't talk so fast.
You go get Tom and get back.
I don't see a conspiracy here.
I'll give you the little money I have.
Tom wants me to have his birthday party next Monday night.
Take out the mask.
That's an option.
You can go anywhere.
I'm kidding.
I like the way you dance.
I need you a little bit.
They beat us.
Tom's the one who's right.
Tom seems scared.
The police will investigate the case.
Now you've got him.
She's white.
Sit down.
Iron is stronger than gold.
I was wondering if you could help me tomorrow afternoon.
Tom got violent.
When does the show start?
Can I just talk to you?
We won't let you die.
The conductors are rubbing me.
Tom didn't say anything about it.
It's probably true.
We had to walk home after the rain.
I like it when I'm alone.
Tom's got a lot of money, but there's no friends.
Each color has its own meaning.
The old house was in bad shape.
I just don't feel safe about it.
I lost my breath.
Can you get those?
My dog really likes oranges.
Your police are full of books.
Tom wasn't sleeping well.
I'm flattered.
You kicked me out.
The answer is confirmed.
We knew you'd come.
I live in town.
Let's go wake Tom up.
How am I gonna find him?
The ice's melted.
I sucked blood.
You're after them.
What can you tell us about him?
Why did you attack them?
I'm afraid of dogs.
Tom asked Mary to bring him a cup of coffee.
I always get early.
I'm sure it's very easy for you.
I've never been caught.
I love my homeland.
I haven't learned how to write.
They stopped.
Tom can handle it.
Don't lecture me.
Tom's comfortable.
Tom didn't answer my question.
The room was locked.
I can't justify it.
Tom was stealing from me.
Victory is bitter.
They're looking in the mirror.
It's not my own fault to cry.
Tom wasn't tall enough to reach the top cop.
Tom sent Marie to the door.
It looks very delicious.
I need to understand.
You two have come up against me!
I've never worn a sleeper in my life.
Don't sleep in the bathtub.
That's what I'm trying to do.
Do you have a cigarette?
The kids are sleeping upstairs.
I'm studying music.
I didn't go through that bad.
Why does Tom have to go to Boston?
I'm pretty proud of that.
Make sure you don't mind.
We live by the sea.
Soldiers wore steel helmets.
I'll send Tom home.
What are you talking about, guys?
I guess you didn't get my message.
Tom assumed Mary caught the fish.
It's boring sitting at home.
It's not that bad.
They're freaking out.
Did you ask Tom why he was late?
Probably won't be worth waiting for.
I've got to buy a new set for the room.
Tell Tom to write to me.
Do you want to go to work?
I couldn't stand it.
It's sunny today, but it's also cold.
What's the point?
I'm not an expert.
My greatest ambition is to become an opera singer.
Help us as much as you can.
Tom's running down.
Tom gave the word.
Tom and Mary have left us since the first day.
Come on, let's get started.
Girls run and play.
I'm not sure Tom just did this.
"Will you not eat the Spanish?" "I will eat it later."
This is my favorite item.
Tom took down the shed.
You're driving me crazy.
I'll find you Tom.
Come and talk to me, Tom.
My new shoes are of real skin and have relatively high heels.
What did you expect me to say?
I feel safe when you're with me.
Tom sang.
Tom's not that tall.
She wears a leather belt on her waist.
They're shutting down the fire.
They finally left.
Tom gave birth to Mary.
I'll go look for them.
Tom came even though he was cold.
I don't want to use a dilda. I prefer real dicks.
I'm not cooking him.
Why are you calling her?
You really need a psychiatrist.
Tom gave the speech.
We're playing Sunday.
Tom's surrounded.
You can only stay if you're quiet.
I want to know what's going to happen next!
I can't believe Tom just did it.
Tom kicked me out.
I didn't want you to hate me.
Have I not already told you everything?
Don't fight.
I expect help from you.
Tom's gonna go on his own.
Tom had only Fridays at school.
Tom agreed with me.
I'm sure your intentions are clear.
Tom was talking too much.
My brother's out.
He was great.
I'd like to be able to tell people my real name.
The fence's built up a temporary breach.
Tom actually laughed.
Tom's allergic to pollen.
They contacted local politicians.
Tom grabs notes.
They gave me this card.
We'll have a discussion about the forecast.
Everyone has their own style.
That doesn't prove anything.
May I eat this apple?
How long has it been since Tom died?
Tom's weird.
That was really nice.
My dad gives me a $10 pocket a week.
I hear you didn't like Tom.
I'm glad you're safe.
How long did you work for them?
I need to help Tom.
Maybe Tom knows French.
Tom was cutting me off.
When was the last time you had to do this?
When you pour wine, it's useful to wipe it with lactose, isn't it?
Men have about seven or eight times more testosterone than women.
What games do you want to play?
Tom wants you to know when you can come to us to help us move the piano.
Tom used to be shy.
It's cold.
I couldn't sleep all night.
Trust me.
I'm looking for you.
Do you want a job?
They're losing their mind.
He really fires me.
I can go wherever I want.
Tom was often abused at school.
When does it start?
The bear's gone by itself.
Tom's over the field.
I put three coffees of fake sugar in your tea.
I like her dark eyes.
Is it time to go?
Tom calmed down.
The glove has a hole in his thumb.
Tom always got what he wanted.
That's how I doubted it.
Tom doesn't do what he has to do.
Dan was still alive.
The universe is neither your friend nor your enemy.
We did everything we could for her.
You should buy some sugar.
What'd you make for dinner?
What did you do next?
Watch out for Tom.
There's fruit and meat in the market.
When she started talking, her voice was less dry than before.
Tom doesn't want to spend the rest of his life in prison.
Tom looked the other way.
Tom's the only one who can make Mary smile.
Can't you cut the price a little bit?
I'm gonna change first.
Tom is now 30 years old.
I didn't ask her to go there.
I hate him.
She became a mother-in-law just a few days before she was ninety-nine years old.
You've been looking everywhere?
It's important to think that nobody's ever anything 100%.
He's gesticulating while he's talking.
Sit next to me.
Tom's adorable.
Tom never lends money to anyone.
I'm really happy for Tom.
Galileo was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1633, but because of his age and poor health, he was allowed to serve as a housekeeper.
Scientists claim that people who laugh more often live longer than those who run the truck.
I often talk to her.
Please don't ask me about them.
Tom crushed the tree.
The land is still watered, and the sword is likely to be abandoned.
You got me sleepy.
What a collection!
Everyone has names.
Have you ever smoked a dick?
The dog was following me.
That was Tom's last word.
I think Tom's gone.
He's trying to become an actress.
My plastic bottle broke.
Is this our cabin?
Let's do this.
We're fine.
I threw my money in the water.
I think that's crazy.
Tom's very rude.
It's expected that the cloud will sink into the swamp.
I can deliver her a message.
She's a little red.
Tom is a patient man.
Tom drank too much.
I have a few questions about them.
Tell Tom I don't know Mary.
We need to help her.
Tom stood there and kept quiet.
I'm collecting stamps.
This time tomorrow we'll be in Boston.
Do you live here?
This room looks like a cat.
I'm not talking about him.
Tom Fusher's stuff.
We don't have to go.
I'm talking to Tom.
You asked me to help.
Tom will tell you when he wants to.
I wouldn't want to talk about her.
Tom wanted Mary to go and leave him alone.
I already know that.
Is that a rhetorical question?
Tom's the brother of one of the victims.
The powders are soft.
That doesn't matter.
I want comics.
You have a really good manuscript.
The wind kept blowing.
Meanwhile, the stupid uncle was sitting in the living room.
Did I talk to you?
Mixes fall from the tree.
Do you have a band?
You can wait here.
I got Friday in French.
I want the class to shut up.
It must be perfectly symmetrical.
Tom wants to go to the beach with us.
I voted for him last year.
The wind's blowing.
It's a risk plan.
How soon does it get from here to the post office?
I don't want Tom involved in this.
It's nothing terrible.
Tom was laughing at everything.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are you still dancing?
Listen carefully, you need to know this.
Are you going to wear a mask this year?
I'll do whatever you want.
I'm not so warm either.
Do you want to talk to me?
If there's an unforgivable act, it's an act of refusing to forgive.
The door's stuck.
Tom asked me for a glass of cold water.
How did you react to the news?
Where did Tom say he was going?
Tom betrayed Mary.
I'm looking for him.
She's lying out at home.
I'm not even sure I remember exactly.
Tom noticed how Mary looked at him.
You're forcing me a lot.
Ask him to explain.
It's still working.
Tom's a nice man.
The eagle is the king of birds.
I'll call you later.
This is blackmail.
Why don't you rest?
You don't have to ask why.
Tom didn't sound as excited as Mary.
Let's talk.
I think Tom's nice.
The sky has cooled.
The gala will wake up the baby.
Just look straight.
That's not something for a man to get ready for.
Tom and Mary play rhymes.
I made up my mind.
Take care of our planet.
Tom leaned on Mary.
I'll call security.
Tom, you think he'd prefer a son.
How did you get here?
He picked up the book.
Don't catch my guitar.
He's very kind, just like you.
I'm gonna go do it.
Tom read Mary's secret journal.
The priest will take some of the blood.
We talked for two hours.
I found out about you from him.
I know you're upset right now.
He's gone.
A long walk gave him an appetite.
I have to go help her.
Tom served himself with a cup of tea and a doughnut.
Tom could tell you.
It's just no way to get Tom to swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?
I wanted to tell you how to do it, but Tom asked me not to tell you.
They both laughed again.
The wedding must be perfect for me.
Tom felt strong.
The meeting's already started.
We want to hear it.
I really like what your hair looks like.
Is he studying outside?
You should lie down early.
Tom's in danger.
He's addicted to pornography.
It's just stupid.
Tom's an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair's broken.
Tom's the tallest guy in the class.
Tom, you grew up fast.
That was our only comfort.
No one would care.
Did you write in a diary today?
I just want this never to happen again.
Can you do it alone?
Is it your radio?
Tom died three weeks before I got out of prison.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to look through the key, but he couldn't see anything.
I couldn't stand it.
I've known the deceased for a long time.
We can't get into that right now.
Why are you bending?
Come on, Tom.
I'm just gonna try and get there in time.
No one came here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking dirty water can cause illness.
Up and down we're ready.
Tom's got an old ear.
I bought them.
I told you I can't.
Tom's books are translated into many languages.
I'm not comfortable with him.
Tom stole your money.
Don't take the tape off.
I helped him break the table.
I was eating steaks with potatoes last night.
It's better for your health to go up the stairs.
Tom bought the coat.
We gave them a sedative.
Your faith is bad.
I'm sorry I told them something at all.
I wouldn't have asked you if I could find someone else.
Pick me up in two and a half.
Tom owns it.
I slept in the couch.
I kind of enjoyed it.
That's exactly what it can do.
Aren't you cold on short sleeves?
Tom's the best.
He's got an eye for art.
That was the worst party I've ever had in my life.
I need a cover.
Tom's very late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know any real Japanese movies?
Did you get them?
The French language was slang first.
Don't you ever call her?
We baked them cakes.
The fingerprints of the knife confirm her guilt.
Can I wait here?
We can look into a dictionary.
Go find him.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
We need directions.
It was ironic.
I made you cookies.
That can be done.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
Maybe I should help them.
I sent Tom the schedule you sent me.
It's not expensive.
It's a real damage.
Having too many books to read is a good thing.
We'd have fun going to the party.
You didn't save the bell.
He hit me in the head.
You have to be careful.
Tom seems suspended.
You're having a party that keeps you young.
You're free.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom looks lonely.
How don't you know?
That was a surprise.
Do you really think you can get here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
It smells like meat.
Demek need to know you?
Tom was skilled at hiding all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
I don't care.
She's running slow.
How can you be so sure?
The picture features bottles of various vegetable oils.
They live in trouble.
Tom's fat.
Tom said it was time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just pulled Tom's room out last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a dead coffin, unlike most vampires.
I'd sell this dog if it was higher.
I'm going to help my friends.
Turns out there's no air from Dan.
Nothing here is mine.
My son really likes rockets.
You need to hurry.
Everyone's talking.
Oh, what's this?
Tom's a wimp.
We despise her.
He came in front of them.
Here, brother, half.
Tom sent the new flies he just bought at the table.
Tom will help Mary.
Dan grew up in an orphanage.
Tom's pissed off.
The landscape is superior.
It's locked.
I found your dolls under your bed.
I can't get in there.
We need to test it.
Freedom of expression was strictly limited.
We're gonna have to hurry.
Tom celebrated his victory with wine.
We don't have a whole week.
I'm gonna try and take it easy.
Esena's here.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Did you challenge the traffic?
The water only needs three minutes to call.
They could fire me for this.
What's the intention?
Tell me where to find him.
You're drunk!
It was so great.
Dan was about Linda for a very short time.
It's impossible for me to answer the question.
I want to sign up for a course.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, gifted with reason and conscience, and should treat one another in the spirit of universal humanity.
What happened was an accident.
This building has a thunderstorm.
They kissed.
I have a friend.
Tom wants to do everything alone.
What's the best?
I'm making a snowman.
Have you seen how it works?
Supeva is salty.
Why don't you go pick him up?
Tom kept practicing.
Try to understand.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Tom looked at the tunnel.
How can you want to be my friend?
I think it's familiar.
I'm jealous.
I offered to smoke his dick, but he answered that he wasn't in the mood.
There's someone in the tunnel.
It's got its boundaries.
With all that noise, I couldn't sleep last night.
Bosiloc, jacinth, rosemary, thyme, and orchid are popular plants.
We're haters.
You're a smart man.
It seemed all right.
Leave this here.
He was sitting on the bench.
Ignorance always creates fear.
They don't pay me much.
I know you like me.
The door's open.
That doesn't sound good enough.
I'll go to the park.
You'll find your toys and books.
My brother and I shared the room.
I knew he couldn't trust Tom.
I know how to keep secrets.
I don't want to run.
Well, I'm kind of flattered even.
I'm practicing.
Maybe she lied to you, but I don't!
Let's just catch the fog.
Forget what I said.
Give him the whole thing.
I'm gonna get it.
Tom put his hand in the bag and pulled out a few coins.
The room was a buyer.
It's just to solve this problem.
They must remove the bullet that stuck to his back.
Epten's fun.
Does Tom look upset?
If you can, this weekend.
I know how it probably sounds.
One of the bags is completely empty.
I'm so sorry, but apparently I lost your sunscreen.
I don't have a sword.
Suspect confession.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're good.
You don't seem to know how it hurts to be alone.
We're importing grain from the United States.
Here's how I wrote it.
I've never seen a fat vegan.
I need paper, pencils, ink and so on.
I don't know how Tom did it, but he did it.
Tom's gone because he's sick.
Cats have the ability to look in the dark.
Tom's busy with his research.
The wipers don't help against the ice.
I was beautiful.
Why are there people in the daytime?
I have a question for her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
Looks like we're not considering asking Tom.
My brother will arrive tomorrow morning.
You don't have to like everything.
Are the calories compressed?
They'll get it soon.
We made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary off the rope.
I broke the vase today.
That's what I care about.
I'll go ask him.
You're lucky I didn't delay you.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I want to make him grizzly.
I was waiting outside.
You're impressive.
You need to grow up and grow up a little bit.
Tom came here from Boston.
I was lucky.
Take me to the Hilton Hotel.
Can I have your name and your phone number?
Tom was kicking me with a stone.
Everyone knows about her.
Thank you for helping us.
What's so mad at Tom?
Tom's gonna be here a few days.
I hope we're the last.
They were under a lot of stress in front of the store to avoid the rain.
I've been reminded of a few reasons.
Tom became a father.
They were weak.
Tom didn't even know Mary had cancer.
It was my fault.
They hired me to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't understand.
Tom was persistent.
He didn't go there.
I need to break your neck.
Why would he be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
One of us can help him.
I'm gonna go check on Tom.
That's a nice jacket.
I like your coffee.
They're all blowing up.
I'm still thinking about her.
Today I found out there's a movie called "Russians are coming!
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was away from school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Thank you.
Let's just say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Is Tom still unable to write his name?
Tom put the diary in the drawer.
Give him a chance.
I'm paying.
How many more days till Christmas?
I wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom's in trouble?
I don't care about that.
Tom has a collection of grandmas.
She was making tea.
Thank you for yesterday.
Do you have enough?
The deaf are transporters to the plague.
I'll call him in a minute.
Tom said it.
I'm starting tomorrow.
I wasn't being honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I can't write that well.
The king did not foresee the fall of the monarchy.
I'm eating from Tom.
I want roasted bones.
What did Tom do here?
He fell asleep while he was driving, so he caused a traffic.
We were suffocated.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove it.
It was so beautiful.
Tom greets Mary by waving.
That's okay.
Tom seems worried.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How is this camera used?
It was snowing last night.
I didn't mean to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak French very well.
Make sure you don't overdo it.
Tom's a bookkeeper.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
Do you need help with something?
It's so beautiful.
I don't understand English, I don't understand German.
It'll take us about three hours to get off this mountain.
I'm just starving.
I was disqualified.
Are you done packing?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom's recovering.
Why would Tom do that?
Who are you with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not get involved.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to trust you.
You're getting too shaky about him.
The president announced that the United States would launch a satellite in orbit.
I can't lend you this book.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
I want to be sweet.
Tom helped me a little.
Am I too early?
It sounds really loud.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom's old-fashioned.
Is this in place?
Do you want to stop?
Take care, Tom.
Tom's on the tops.
I can't turn it off.
We shouldn't have stayed up until 2:30.
You really do.
Do you think we should give up?
That's not reasonable.
Women in America didn't have the right to vote.
My neighbor called a fireman.
Tom said I should talk to someone about what happened.
The trees are green.
Tom's dying.
Tom was very open.
Did the dog give it to him?
Tom doesn't listen to us.
Tom's a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Was that all the excitement?
Tom's gone somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The alarm bell rang.
I'm sorry I didn't give you any more support.
Is there any objection?
Tom was lying on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'll stay here.
I wonder why they picked him.
It's a silent fact.
Is it delicious?
Watch out!
We should give Tom a chance to admit it.
The sky is cloudy.
We don't talk much.
You're a kind man.
Tom's getting a little sloppy.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer the black one.
Tom surrendered to his fate.
I don't need it right now.
Tokyo is similar to Bogotá, and Osaka is similar to Medellín.
Did you stop beating your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why did you stop us, Tom?
I said I'd get it.
You're going through a kind of titties.
I'll start.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I'm cooking soup in a big tangerine.
If I know Jesus, I'll examine his stomachs.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell this to you if you're willing to pay the price.
Where's the wheel going?
He wiped his wet hair with a towel.
If an adult lies, he thinks he's always right.
Wow, it's really late.
You'll be in danger.
Try your luck!
I may not graduate.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I heard about that.
Tom pulled a screwdriver out of the toolbox.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy this sentence.
Dan decorated the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom was waving his hands.
Open the teapots.
You can't let that happen.
Tom opened the parachute.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do anything.
Tom went on to the next question.
That was considerate.
I want life.
Tom's not in his bed.
That was all my idea.
I don't want any puzzles.
This book will help you write your skills.
This area is located in the valley.
Do you really want to stay until Monday?
I didn't think you'd be busy.
That's not scary.
I hope Tom finds happiness in his life.
You said we'd never catch her.
Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston amongst me.
Please blow up the room.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates laughed at her.
I'm sorry, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he already saw Mary this morning.
I'm going to have toss my toast with honey.
They've tasted the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I have a lot of land.
The area is very isolated.
I guess the parrot escaped from the cage.
We went to pick up strawberries.
We live on the planet Earth.
I love sunglasses.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not absurd.
You'll get them back.
Tom threw out his girlfriend.
Just give it to Tom.
No one's excited.
I almost wouldn't have come.
I was making cake.
Look at the number.
I was impressed by your design.
You told me to call whenever.
What's that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Turn it off.
Tom's suffocating.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
Hi, how are you?
Last month, I had an infection of the urinary bladder.
Look at the girls.
I'm going to take down the shed.
That's exactly what happened before.
I have my own theory.
I appreciate the foreign languages!
And Tom can help you.
I wonder why we got married.
How do we benefit from that?
I'm just with the one I want to be with.
You invited me to your wedding.
Tom just got fired.
Now you can sit down.
But I didn't see anything.
"How are you?" "All right, thank you!"
Mary was a beautiful bride.
Tom should be ashamed.
Wait a minute, Tom.
For me, every Finnish sentence is a quick call.
The lock's broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll figure out what's going on.
Where do you want us to go?
We didn't do anything wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary might agree.
Why did you leave me?
I don't want spring.
Everyone has to stay.
We were just confused.
You're not Japanese.
Tom has very good qualities.
Go to the others.
Well, that's good.
You need to eat more.
Tom doesn't care about sports.
Shouldn't we help them?
I wasn't sorry about them.
Tom feels he needs to be redeemed.
It's a message for them.
When am I gonna get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this.
Tom raised his knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'm gonna say.
I'm not your shoulder.
The company fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was here.
We don't hang out.
Where's the mailbox?
The Internet is a serious thing.
Mars is the red planet.
You fooled the dog with a stone.
Tom kept staring.
It's already seven o'clock.
I'm curious.
We can try.
Demek wrote this book himself!
Don't put so much pepper in the soup.
Let's not be fooled.
They looked around.
Tom looked through the window and saw Mary play with her dog.
Tom was drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need Tom's help.
They were happy.
How can we help?
To prepare the ground for planting, you need to empty it.
Tom's not good today.
We don't see.
Mahmoud can't stand to lose.
No one's listening to you.
All right, convince me.
I'm ready for him now.
It's not possible!
Tom missed the bus.
Forgetfulness and hate usually go together.
Tom didn't know that happened.
I'm at the library.
My pants are off.
I asked them what was wrong.
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
If I had wings, I'd fly.
I agreed.
Tom admitted to pouring out the red wine.
Do you want a dog?
I live near the dam.
You're all cowards.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is a virtue.
Bush respects human rights.
They broke the rules.
Did you hear about us?
We visited Laura's castles.
Tom's a hopeless case.
It's a little ahead.
I think of him every day.
I'll help you find Tom.
We're almost there.
I realized I hadn't eaten yet.
I'd love to save him.
You knew, didn't you?
You're all here.
Stay as much as your soul wants.
Just grab my hand.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Who would know that?
I can't get into that.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He's very pedant at his job.
Come to the house.
Why is music so fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did that?
They're not alone.
I remember you were in Boston for a short time.
How many stomachs do I have to do every day?
Will you cry?
Tom turned around to go.
Tom's kind.
What was the party yesterday?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come here and watch a movie?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is nonsense.
I hate to do this.
Day turned into a question.
You've got a lot of hairy eyes.
Isn't that what you mean?
I thought I was tired.
How long should I wait?
Take Tom to town.
We should let Tom get back to work.
I want you all to shoot them.
I think I'm writing pretty well.
Are you going back to work?
I'll be with you soon.
Let me in.
Don't fire them.
You need a friend.
Tom seems rich.
Tom seems more confident.
Would you like to have some water?
Tom's not friendly.
However, the quantity is not correct.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me a little about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to the party.
The squares have four angles.
I kept working.
They're developing addiction.
Would you like me to come with you?
We'll wait there.
Can you check those?
Give them a second.
They sat down and kept quiet.
Bring the shovel.
You have many different kinds of people here.
Mary was messing with her mother.
Pick one.
What do they want with me?
No one listened to Tom.
You want me to get something from the supermarket?
Finish the Mass.
Tom wiped out the knife from the farmers.
Tom was struggling to stay focused.
Tom has a long beard.
One of them came to me.
I can arrange for that to happen.
Are your nipples bleeding?
Just let her call me, okay?
Tom put his beer on the bar.
The devil is a squirrel.
I didn't say I speak French.
I'm getting a seductive look.
Come on, don't be shy.
I wouldn't want to eat meat from a cloned animal.
How far did you go?
My father is very strict.
Maybe I'd better come back later.
What do the tigers eat?
I'm just gonna buy another one.
Will you get down?
Give him a dollar.
Did you have an autopsy?
Tom's lying.
Explain to me how that's possible.
You looked me through the glasses.
Linda convinced Dan that she was dead.
Why would they mind?
Let's not bother Tom.
It's tough.
I just need a break.
I got a warrant for Tom.
I couldn't do that.
There's yours.
We didn't want that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Did you buy these for them?
I want you to behave the way you do.
I need to get rid of us.
Why is the sky blue?
Where's Tom's keys?
Did you hurt Tom?
Who could have broken the aquarium?
He came over my head.
Tell me what I'm looking for here.
Tom has struggled with depression over many periods of his life.
Should I take your pockets?
I'd trust them with my life.
I'm kind of hungry.
I'll try.
What are you gonna worry about?
I need dinner.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who his French teacher was.
The class is looking up.
There were penguin feet on the sand.
Tom just left.
Dan called for a scalper.
I want to brush my hair.
I respect the decision you made.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
You can eat as much as your soul wants.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move.
I'm not talking fast.
We need to talk in four eyes.
Tom's not excited.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep there.
I live in a town near Boston.
I hope the new boss likes you.
Did you mention the results of the test?
If you want quality, pay.
Tom was starving.
She's studying English.
With such a powerful dream, he will become either a famous writer or a madman.
We both hate her.
They're starting to beat her.
Tom opened the windows in the bedroom.
Don't even talk to me.
We'll survive this.
We're here to apologize.
We will visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end up poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom blew the chewing gum.
Let it be mine.
I bought them something.
Mother, thank you for giving me birth.
Who recommended that?
How did you do that?
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I finally beat him.
How easy it is to develop bad habits!
She's starting to behave weird.
Probably won't pay the money.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda how she was born interested in archaeology.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think will know the answer?
What do we do next?
We want to help him.
Tom used to eat meat.
You always get me wrong.
We're as strong as you are.
The president looked strong.
What do you want me to buy?
Tom went to the window and looked outside.
They stole his cell phone.
I'm sad.
I'll be in Boston this whole week.
Tom couldn't do what he wanted.
I thought you were playing chess better than me.
Is the bridge safe?
Give us an example.
Kennedy was talking about the problem.
I came here yesterday.
Tom said Mary was a Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me.
We tried to get them to come.
I'm not gonna say that again.
Turn off the lights.
I need a clean shirt.
If people are afraid enough, everything can happen.
You're a narrow town.
He was running as fast as he could.
Is Tom back?
Tom's neck is stuck.
Grab the day.
What's Tom calling?
He's very handsome.
Let the buyer take care of it.
Tom's been running for hours.
Now it's time for a replacement.
Most virgins have a whole hymen.
You can get out of here.
Why did you just spray two sausages?
When I feed the poor, they call me a saint, and when I ask why the poor don't have food, they call me a communist.
I don't care about that.
I wonder what's for dinner.
Tom is interested in French history.
Because the bus was delayed, we waited a long time for the rain.
You'll manage.
Is there that dog?
I'm resting.
Mary was wearing fake twitches.
Here's how I did it.
I've always wanted to get to one of these.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he was speaking French better than he really was.
How much time do I have?
It's almost summer.
Maria didn't understand the lecture.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
My shoes are soaked.
That medicine calmed the patient down.
Tom's next crime will be his last.
Please accept the job offer.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look stupid.
His mother is an American.
Relax a little.
Is Tom amusing?
Tom and Mary don't even know each other.
The sphinx began to circle around him.
We need your help to find her.
That means we can't eat it anymore.
Tom missed the party.
Tom Füsherski did his job.
Tom closed the drawer.
Tom seemed upset.
Please tell them what to do.
Bacteria are microscopic organisms.
I decide, Tom.
Don't listen to the boss blind.
I've been looking for him for a while.
It's good.
Tom's getting sick.
Anybody else here?
Tom always liked you.
We'll never know now.
Should we wait for him here?
Enjoy the day.
Tom just freaked him out.
I prefer goat cheese than cow cheese.
We get that.
How's that different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I haven't eaten dairy products in a long time.
I'll be able to see you next year.
That was our plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Have you met Tom?
Is everybody having fun?
I've been awake all night.
I've got unfinished business with Tom.
Did that happen to you?
I know it's yours.
Tom reminded Mary to renew her driver's license.
It was creepy.
The carpenters cut wood.
I think you've been here before.
That's all I needed.
Where are you born?
It's all over.
One sex couples shouldn't be able to get married.
The cow forgot it was a body once.
Give them this picture.
Tom was buried alive.
Swim is a handy thing.
Let's go see Tom.
I'm so confused.
Tom, if there's a problem, I want to know.
Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister drop the letter.
Let me try that.
Could you put the cigarette out?
What were they laughing at?
Why would he believe her?
What's the girl sitting there?
I didn't know about them.
My stomach hurts.
Look at this place.
I want to be a taxi driver.
There's still no sign of Tom.
That's when I was home.
Don't push me.
I'll see you later, okay?
I want to live in New Delhi.
Let's talk.
The Alligator ate the dog.
Lies give birth to other ships.
I don't have any more money.
The table is plastic.
Sunlight is a supposedly best disinfectant.
You'll get a copy.
I need to feed them.
She's always heartless.
They're getting hurt.
Tom knew he didn't speak French as well as Mary.
That was very helpful.
You hung me up.
Did you call for quick help already?
Bring me lunch. Our plan is to take a walk in the park.
You have to answer the question.
Red light's on.
John's at the airport.
Tom was supposed to be ready an hour ago.
Let your conscience bite you now.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
The first snow fell today.
Her charm is indescribable.
I'm at work tomorrow.
How much do you bet on?
Now we need it.
I don't know what you're looking for here.
Blood's going through the body.
I'll make him go.
This is a vertical line.
He always smells like a mayonnaise.
They won't help lies.
My right leg hurts.
The apple is healthy.
I wanted to be just like Tom.
What can you tell me about him?
I have to buy them presents.
What would the prince like?
Where do we come from?
I really don't know.
Do you have a chopper?
Tom's hot for attention.
Dan had no compassion for any human being.
When did Tom arrive?
Can I leave her a message?
I gave that order six hours ago.
Look at the drawing.
Their houses are built of stone.
Yeah, I said that, but I wasn't right.
I think we should talk about this now.
The meetings were held at intervals.
Tom seemed so happy.
I don't know English, I don't know Spanish.
What are you doing with this?
No one's gonna bother you.
Tom didn't think of things like that.
There's wind.
I'm just kidding with you.
I don't know where that is.
We've all noticed that.
I'm one of your students.
And I bought a hand watch.
Just sit there.
Tom barely knows how to go.
So you said you wanted to go with us?
I expect visitors.
They saved the entire team.
At what age did you begin to masturbate?
You're scaring me.
But not in front of people.
The company went bankrupt.
I'm 12 years old.
I'm focusing.
Tom's not much of a talker.
You were right, guys.
It's happening.
There were no other injuries.
I decided to take a train.
I'm sure you'll manage.
Are you going to eat at home or out?
I have three cousins.
If I eat more, it'll hurt.
Are you kidding me?
I think I know him.
I'm drinking milk.
Don't be mad at Tom.
That's a tough job.
You should make him listen.
I'm surprised it's so easy.
Camoli would have been here.
Tom wasn't hungry.
Tom often calls Mary.
Thank you, darling.
They have increased the territory of the kingdom.
I didn't come here to hurt people.
Tom must've already knew about it.
My mother's sister is my aunt.
I've been looking everywhere for them.
Tom's incapacitated.
My school has a band.
Tom can't deny it.
He's gone red.
I have to go.
Whoever sleeps with dogs wakes up with pain.
His aunt's all alone in London.
It's not a big wonder.
I'm sick.
This neighborhood is very lonely.
Maybe he'll come back tonight.
I fixed his radio.
This is a leather belt.
Tom's stuck in his belly.
When did I try to give you money?
How's your mother?
It doesn't matter.
Listen.
Tom says he can pay for it.
She didn't show up.
I'll admit it.
I'll ask him in your name.
Don't tell my mother.
You can avoid such problems if you have such advice in mind.
His excuse is far from perfect.
I hope we win Tom.
Put your things away.
Where'd you put it?
Tom can't accept a defeat.
Tom's my husband.
What do I get from that?
Don't you think Cookie would be a good dog name?
Tom wasn't very busy.
Tom told me he'd be back by the end of the week.
I want a room for a man.
You shouldn't be here for this.
Do you have any idea where Tom might be?
He asked for a beer.
Let's not ruin that.
You're so passionate.
My headache's over.
I don't like that word.
Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planets.
You want me to ask him?
Give Tom the scarf.
The weather here is very unpredictable.
Is she really that beautiful?
Hey, don't let it be your fault.
Isn't that unusual?
I'm out of the wall.
The clock's broken.
Tom must be stopped.
Isn't that too much?
They know what happened.
Tom took the joke off his face.
Your hair smells like spring.
The tower was standing in the middle of the ruins.
Tom's a great materialist.
Tom says he's rich.
Just relax a little.
Have you read it?
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
Give me your claws.
The hazelnuts love cold weather.
This is a little loose on my waist.
Tom never lived in Boston.
Did you forgive me already?
Did Tom know?
Would you lie to Tom?
I'm not even tired.
She's afraid of losing money.
Tom swallowed his ex.
Canada makes good wheat.
He loves his dad so much.
Let's get up.
It's not that we're doing something.
Tom went well today.
Milton didn't sleep well all week.
When's the big day?
I worked for him.
How long did Tom say he was planning on staying with us?
Give him everything we have.
It's not a secret that Tom disagrees with you.
Tom's still in bed.
What are you preparing?
Now this is your house.
Why don't you try some sushi?
How are you?
I feel better.
What's the difference?
I wish I could live my life by doing only what I love.
It's not my decision.
Despite our expectations, there were no charges.
The hunt is one of the seven fatalities.
Tom's irresponsible.
I always wanted to be a teacher.
Tom saw Mary ready to say something.
I won't be in this town next week.
And they sown seed, and grew up, and reaped; so the river was shut up.
He feels hatred for his father.
Tom helped us escape.
Tom was in an accident.
Tom took Mary home.
I often ski.
I'll get the beer.
What other reason could there be?
Did you see anyone?
I have to be free.
I'm as qualified as Tom.
When will my turn come?
Tom didn't make it.
I'm a new student.
The baby's asleep.
How rich is Tom?
It's obviously a print error.
It's not often that someone buys a $1,000 hat.
Is the police coming?
We need to find him first.
Dan made fun of the assistants with their comments.
You don't have to go.
I barely escaped being caught.
I can't get involved.
You beat them.
They shut up.
Tom's coming back soon.
I'd be for you.
History writes the winners.
Tom was the only one on the ship when it exploded.
Who's gonna make up for the cyan?
Tom doesn't like the house he lives in.
Nothing's bothering me here.
You cheated on me.
It's for heat.
Nothing's sacred.
Looks like Tom's pretty proud of himself.
Actually, no one knows.
Give me the shovel.
She's here.
He was looking for the key.
This is bad for the environment.
We're squeezing.
Do we have a choice?
I don't know why I reacted that way.
I was on three points.
I'm here to talk about her.
We have fish for dinner today.
I don't eat restaurants very often.
Do we have any food?
That's almost there.
You've got an infection.
I can't remember anything better.
The sky is red in summer.
I came to wish you luck.
I'd like you to come too.
They must be happy.
We have to fix this.
I don't speak English.
We'll handle it.
The bread is made of flour.
Where's the guy who beat them?
Dan, you got this right.
Do you want a cookie?
Who brought this?
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
Dan might have fought Linda.
There was silence in the room.
Everyone loves him.
Tom was driving like a maniac.
It was a hard test.
It's hot here in hell.
I saw that.
This is your job!
Please come back to me.
Study here.
Congratulations on your wedding.
Children, you stay here.
We need your help.
Let's just go find them.
Go to Tom's house.
Does he lie to your dog?
Beautiful!
The palace has a high tower.
The kids have homework.
Let's go get them.
She's a teacher.
The hard question is how.
You have to ask them first.
I made a phone call.
Tom's gone away.
I'm not sure Tom was the one who did it.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I won't mind if you leave.
Tom himself came here.
I forgot my joke.
We've suffered a lot.
Tom wanted everyone to think he was dead.
Scientific research often requires heavy compromises.
Tom just got his prosthetics.
I have to try to find him.
I took care of it.
Tell me the details.
Are you busy with something?
Go wake up, Mary.
You almost missed him.
I hate that pipe.
The doctor gave her a sedative.
Does Tom look like a man who's afraid of someone?
What happened to Tom and Mary?
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I love you as you are.
It's funny.
It's very relaxing.
Keep your weapons ready.
We had our reasons.
His reputation was threatened.
I wish I hadn't done that.
Let me help you with that.
I stole it from them.
Why doesn't anyone want to help us?
The hole's tight.
You should go help him.
Do you enjoy it?
I had a great time tonight.
Tom was in the cabin.
Tom's playing the sound.
Tom and Mary are waiting for you on the porch.
It's nice of him to bring presents like this.
I embarrassed him.
Shut up or they'll throw you out.
Get away from me.
Let's get started!
How long does it take?
I'm good, thank you!
Don't be late for the meeting tomorrow.
That's the message.
It's getting dark.
Tom was raised.
I'm surprised Tom went with Mary.
He's blind from birth.
The book contains fifteen biographies.
Tom worked all night.
Tom was just here.

Sign down, please.
Tell me where to find her.
It was really good.
Did you know that Tom lived in Boston?
Tom, I only wore one shoe.
You don't want to do anything to remind them that you're not really big enough to be here.
I won the lottery.
We could talk about music.
I slept like a slaughter.
I have faith in myself.
Tom's here, isn't he?
Oh, my God, it's coming back.
Ish, you bastard!
They ran into the water.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom speaks French better than you think.
Let's all help them.
This is a glass mosaic.
Tom didn't come home last night at all.
I think we've had enough to eat.
This is very difficult for them.

Tom taught me to make pancakes.
The one who washes the car is Mr. Jones.
Tom seems terrified.
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
I know Tom's in Boston now.
That's her.
I can transport you.
Is Tom safe?
Still, there is a solution.
You're unorganized.
I'm trying.
I'm sure Tom's gonna do it like this.
I don't think I've ever been so scared before.
Can you do the job?
We need to get back to him.
You're uncultural.
Are you sportsing?
It just sounds boring.
Get him in there.
He lied to us all the time.
Tom didn't say he was gonna help us.
Tom took the knife.
The people in Madrid are going crazy.
That's completely incorrect.
I'd better call her first.
He's very friendly.
Tom can't wait anymore.
I'm just practicing to look nice when I'm naked.
Thousands of years are worth a thousand years.
I'll put it on your account.
I'm planning on visiting Tom in Boston next weekend.
I didn't expect you to do that for Tom.
A word of honesty.
We've got three guards working in a different way.
We can't stay together.
Visitors are welcome.
Can you introduce yourself in a few words?
Tom was here.
I want you to call them.
Bring your toolbox.
Does Tom contribute?
This is a little embarrassing.
We were both busy.
I've been away for three hours.
I want crossword puzzles.
I expected them to be here.
Tom painted this.
Tom shut his mouth.
So you don't hate him?
Stop acting like a child.
Tom's not a fire.
He never hired them.
I want some cake.
We didn't do anything for them.
I'm trying to help Tom.
Tom's a retired dentist.
That was very nice.
I'm gonna go hide.

Tom got out of prison.
I'm glad I work here.
Where did Tom say he wanted to go?
I'm waiting for it to burn green.
You want me to massage your shoulders?
Get on my head.
I was right with my head.
Tom told me he was planning on going to Boston.
Tom never gets sick.
But that's a completely different story.
Who's your best friend?
Next night, I didn't sleep well.
I'm gonna go and finish.
I'm going to change.
You dropped my earphone.
It might sound like a suggestion, but the order was.
Maybe I should just tell Tom I want my money back today.
You'd be a great mother.
Tom's still working.
Please find my head.
Why did they choose them?
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Tom doesn't agree.
They rejected our first proposal.
Sooner or later, it'll break my movie.
Can you just give me a minute?
Never, but never at all, it could have happened here.
Tom was burning in front of the fire.

Here's your schedule today.
Tom didn't wait.
I want to eat pizza.
Tom's an architect.
There were candles everywhere.
I finally found you.
That was my suitcase.
The toy is made of wood.
Thank you in advance.
The question is what you're gonna do.
Tom told Mary he loved her.
Well, we're not in a hurry.
Tom won't know what to do.
Tom seemed a little surprised.
We didn't find him.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
You came back two days ago.
It's not a shame.
If you're late, I'll be late for you.
You really should have let me call a cab.
I made an apple pie.
The spear of the horse's spear calmed him down.
Your hands are soft.
Can I see him again?
That's not my real name.
This book fully covers the subject.
I think this is over.
Linda wore modest dress all the time.
Didn't you smoke?
They let me go.
Tom never thanks anyone.
He summoned his fellow students.
These are my parents.
I'm late for school.
Tom got in touch with Mary.
Are you just cooking for yourself?
Tom told me he'd like to go to the zoo with us tomorrow.
I'm sure.
We're gonna need Tom's permission.
His joke didn't all laugh.
The main question is what to do about it.
I'm sure you've seen everything you need.
This is pointless.
They ate.
How many cups of coffee a day are too much?
Tom hates running.
Excuse me, do you know what time it is?
I was dancing with my hands.
Tom doesn't have a brain.
I'm just a farmer.
You'd do the same for me.
Now, let's continue this conversation in the other room.
I don't hate it.
Tom wouldn't do that.
Don't talk to me like that!
I laughed.
Can I see the report?
That's not very wise.
Are you going?
I'm happy these days.
I didn't make that mistake again.
Let's stop cheating.
Try to understand this.
What kind of man are you?
I should try to help them.
Can I gather a soul?
She's helping him.
Always try to see the best in people.
Tom earns three times as much as I do.
I cried one.
Write your birth date.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about it.
I'll call him later.
These are as good as they are.
She seemed excited.
We're wasting time.
Tom said he and Mary couldn't come to the party.
Just try and find him.
Tom put his coat in the closet.
I think Tom's tiny.
Is the difference visible?
Visit us tomorrow.
Tom was visiting Mary once a year.
Nothing seems real to me.
Did you ask Tom for money?
Tom didn't actually do that.
Is this your bag?
It'll help her sleep the most.
This is Nina, your grandson.
I'll take the vegetables.
They've been scanning for half an hour.
Dolkun's been doing a lot of hard work lately, but he doesn't even see the slightest result of it.

Please come to me next Saturday, if you want.
I'm not sure.
That's no longer necessary.
Can you shut up?
Tom didn't know where Mary was.
The house is red.
We've seen aliens.
I have to go to the hospital tomorrow.
Where's your sister?
Tom's sleeping tight.
It was seven and a half.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston with Mary.
I want you to be with me.
She dreamed of becoming a nurse.
Tom has an obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Don't talk about him like that.
Love is stronger than hate.
You've got a rash.
It's written on his face.
Thank you for coming through.
I'm as tall as he is.
Tom couldn't have done that without Mary's help.
So there's Tom?
Last night she spent her night drinking in a meat spa.
I'm in.
Do you need a rent?
Saul's gone.
I didn't say I trusted him.
It's a classic.
Tom's already there.
I'd like to repay you.
They're coming again.
You're really nice.
I bet Tom paid a lot for his new car.
This is a joke.
I wouldn't believe Mary at all.
I've never seen the grapes before.
I don't think they followed us.
I feel like I'm free.
Just smile and keep smiling.
You didn't notice the change.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
Tom helped Mary escape the prison.
Tom has no tea.
I'm tired.
But that's not an argument!

That's a good system.
I don't remember Tom so high.
It was really nice.
I'm free tonight.

How did you get on vacation?
Back then, we were just a few people in a gorilla group.

I'll tell my wife.
If I don't invite Tom to my party?

You travel a lot?
Did you tell Tom about your back pain?
That's what everybody does.
Tom is often unpredictable.
They loved each other.
Tom collects stamps.
I want you to find her.
The light of the sun.
And it's a lot that consists of members B, B, and A.
Tom's free.
Are you sure you were alone in the house?
What did you need?
You're a fraud.
It's generally known that you don't like Tom.
I'd be happy if you three were back outside.
What's stopping you?
Tom has thin lips.
The kids are squeezing.
Tom exercises violin at least half an hour each day.
I'm still mad at Tom.
I'm using this.
This is Tom's book.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
It's so funny.
Let's do it tonight.
I felt their pain and suffered along with them.
Camoli Tom had more time for me.
I'm digging for him.
Tom had a bad day.
My grandmother's death was a big shock.
You're burning your car.
She was able to learn to drive a car.
Tom had a few more things to say.
Let's not panic.
I don't have the strength of will when it comes to exercise.
Come on to Tom.
This is one of the most beautiful sunsets I've ever seen.
Tom's room is slum.
At your service.
I want to watch football on TV.
I'd still like to go to Boston with you.
What did Tom say?
Do we really need that much food?
This is one of the most popular restaurants in Boston.
Tom seemed a little uncomfortable.
I invited Tom to my place.
Tom and Mary seem to be perfect for each other.
I couldn't ask him for money.
The more things I have, the more I have to clean.
I got a solution!
I didn't see Tom.
Don't forget to rub on the sun cream.
Was it hard for you?
Tom's voice barely listened to him.
Don't you dare.
I decided to forgive him.
How many days does it usually take to get there?
Don't forget these.
When's that gonna happen?
We're gonna have to make an order.
His depression ended when she kissed him.
We're not even sure Tom's guilty of anything.
Is she pregnant or is she just fat?
Just get some sleep.
Tom's good to me.
No one will find us.
The room was chaos.
Music is just love looking for words.
Sitting all day is unhealthy.
Tom'll wait.
I'm begging you to step in.
The true story is a little different from what you said.
It was your fault.
The balloon was slowly coming down.
Who wants insects?
It's bullshit.
I asked him the same question.
Take three steps and jump.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I'll be back in half an hour.
Tom never acted like he was ashamed of me.
My real name is Tom.
Tom started laughing.
Is that why you're here?
You haven't changed your mind, have you?
When the phone rang in the middle of the night, she immediately knew something was wrong.
We're avoiding him.
I want to give you something rare.
I'm totally naked.
Her gestures to me don't matter.
This is for you, Tom.
It doesn't matter what you don't want to do; at least you have to.
I did it.
Are you ten years old?
We still need a plan.
Aren't you glad to see me?
Merisole and Johnny are eating pizza.
It's not a big wonder.
We need something that will remove our thoughts from our problems.
I called you yesterday.
Let me focus.
She sells sea schools.
Guard the prisoner.
We all like you.
The kid was crying and crying for hours.
I'll go ask them.
Tom's not like his brother at all.
Tom was in town.
That was brilliant.
Please tell me.
You're not a freak.
Aren't you excited?
Tom couldn't do it on his own.
You're a wise man.
No one went there.
Let me introduce Mr. Tanaka.
Do you know how late it is?
Tom cut the pie into eight pieces.
Maybe you'll need it.
I have chest pain.
I can't untie this knot.
Give me back my money.
You have to show yourself first.
My father is a quiet man.
I'm telling you, you could be a professional drummer.
You stole my new hand watch.
It doesn't look very different.
It's been examined.
Tom and make Mary's room on the bench.
We're kicking him.
It's okay.
Let's go to the zoo.
I don't know whether to be happy or not.
Did you save her?
Tom wrote to me and told me about his trip.
Your excuse is right up and down.
I don't know anyone like that.
Keep looking for Tom.
We're still warming up.
Tom and Mary got out of the room, leaving John alone.
It's so complicated.
I thought you were funny.
The thief stole the precious stones last night.
Green light... red light!
Tom's your teacher.
I've already packed.
Since when do you feel the movements of the fetus?
I can't do that on my own.
You better let me do that.
This house is better than that other house.
I'm sure Tom did it.
Let me see it.
What does it contain?
Did you see anything?
I'm done.
Marry me.
Tom's not a hero.
I'll find someone else to help us.
The sun and the night shine.
No one gets fired.
There's nobody else.
When I was traveling to New York City from Boston, I met a nice girl on a bus.
Tom said you were in Boston.
He pulled the rope.
I don't feel my legs.
How can you say that?
Tom's got a fog.
They tied my eyes.
Do we really want to help them?
He who pays the bills has the right to be master.
You're so lucky.
Yeah, bring me some cheese.
When are you going to visit?
Every day tragedy happens.
We didn't bring you anything.
I'm listening well.
Give me those sheets.
You can take mine.
Tom won't like it.
All comments are excessive.
Did you do this for me?
Can you call them for help?
Tom cried his mouth.
That smells like cheese.
Tom's not in error.
The patient suffers from hallucinations.
Why is it so important to be there today?
Goodness without gold is better than gold without honor.

We're all pioneers.
I'll see you again.
We were so young then.
I hear you've been wondering about me.
While he was eating pizza, he was bothering his sister.
We should've quit before.
That's close enough.
Tom's polite.
Don't count on them.
And I'm surprised myself.
We're having dinner.
My work so far has been in vain.
"Why are you doing this?" "I can do it."
What a pig you are.
Lock the door.
Tom lets the heat go.
We're all the same.
I want to be next to you.
I think we're close to the solution.
You're not that terrible.
Well, I'm here for you.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my fault.
This sounds quite acceptable.
How do you know that?

Can't you help me?
I'm not going to kneel.
What were you doing with Tom yesterday?
I'm not gonna suffocate.

These are wonderful.
Tom's got his hands busy.

That's ugly.
There may be discussions about that.

Before I lay down, I had three pills against my nose.
Tom may not be right.
They may need help.
I don't have a vodka.
Tom's acting like a blurry brat.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
We should ask him.
I'll get them back.
What did you want to see me for?
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
They're very good.
Do you want movies?
Time is eternal.
First, you have no right to make conclusions, secondly, your argument was based on an invalid assumption.
Who would blame him?
The audience seems to be bored.
I'm raising the goods.
She borrowed the line.
I'll see you.
I had to get something.
I trusted them.

Pick one.
Tom's angry and scared.
You're mean and rejected.
I wish I could help you more.
Tom's out of sight.
I think we're done.
Tom saw Mary sitting in the park alone.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
They completely renovated the facade of the building, and when I passed by it with a car, I didn't recognize it.
Is it possible to have only this?
We'll deal with this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This has to stop.
It's fair.
I know you're busy.
All the kids were sitting around the floor.
Tom, forget it.
Invite him to join us.
Doing so will not be easy without great help.
Tom knows Boston well.
This time we won.
Tom works in a nearby restaurant.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
They gave me a seat.
This is not related to the subject.
I'll be back in a little while.
She seemed deeply troubled by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we are not careful, the same will happen to us.
Here I am.
Tom was my boyfriend.
We need some help.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
This is a very difficult test.
I'll get divorced.
That dinner.
My weight's running out.
They'll make you brute.
Tom's a good poet.
The bridge collapsed when one of the ropes broke.
The geezer threw out the flour hot water every two hours.
Listen to your teachers.
You don't suggest we give Tom all the money, do you?
Tom kept packing.
I don't have a home I could go back to.
I'm here by my own will.
It's to protect you.
I've always been helped by someone.
They don't want that.
Tom's taking over.
I'll tell you all about it later.
My dogs are white.
That's comforting.
He says he wants to see you.

That surprised me.
This is the thing we discussed the other day.
I think Tom can help.
Life is a deadly semi-re bearable disease.
That doesn't surprise me.
Turn around at the corner.
She betrayed me.
Why are you whining when we kiss?
Someone will see us.
I'll give him another chance.
Tom finally laughed.
Tom's house is here somewhere.
I left you a message.
Would Tom like that?
I totally misjudged her.
It'll be over soon.
I didn't say I'd agree.
Did you know my father?
Tom was about to shoot me.
Tom's talking.
I had to arrest her.
They know something.
He knows how to play the piano.
Give her a little privacy.
Tom didn't even offer Mary a chicken coffee.
Don't talk like that.
I think we can catch him.
Tom wanted to have a bigger ship than his brother.
God created the semen.
It's not too early.
May I eat?
They painted the frames of the yellow windows.
Tom, are you in here?
You can use this car.
Nice to meet you.
It's like I'm flattered.
We have to wait here.
Is everything okay with you?
Does that sound familiar to you?
How much do you want?
Tom's losing his blood.
I have to stay here.
All or nothing.
This information is confidential.
I came for them.
My life has changed.
Nobody's talking about them.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
Me and you will fly the same plane.
Tom's not coming back.
Tom promised me a lot of money.
Who gave him all that money?
I thought we could help you.
Tom doesn't listen.
I'll get the wine.
I'll remember that.
What time does it start?
Can you move your ears?
I met Tom at the auction a few years ago.
Did you win the race?
One hour to the event.
You were amazing.
I won't give up until I find out who was responsible.
The alarm rings.
The bird raised the border with the clown and flew to its nest.
Tom wanted to go.
I know about the job offer.
It's already open.
That depends on whether we buy it or not.
Tom's not the same man three years ago.
Everyone laughed at her.
Tom asked Mary to let him take care of it himself.
There's something I need to ask you.
Tom's pretty good.
I need to go see Tom.
Tom's unusually calm.
I'm gonna ask Tom to take the time for you tomorrow morning.
What the hell are you buying?
Tom was struggling to get rid of himself.
What am I gonna do to them?
Tom didn't tell Mary anything.
It's not the right time.
I'll be home before noon.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I went and bought ten sheep all at once.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would.
Tom's running by Mary's.
A cat scratched me.
Tom's not an old man.
The question is how Tom did it.
I swear it was them.
Did you have a bath suit?
His nose's the best.
Now I can't ask them.
Tom has a defensive hair.
Long live the USSR!
Epten's strong.
I want to buy pineapple.
I was home yesterday.
That's my only hope.
Don't come after me.
It's just a question.
The bush is burning.
Tom was affected.
My conscience is bothering me.
How did you know Tom was gonna lie to me?
Each country has its own language.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
The frogs are wonderful creatures.
There are three brothers.
I don't know if I'll have time to do that.
Tom's drunk with tequila.
In other words, she's a little deaf.
We humiliated Tom.
You're getting a lot of bluff.
We want more money.
Don't lose it.
Do you agree with yours?
Tom's doing something.
You should have asked her first.
Tom's got a scar on his face.
Don't you believe us?
I respect you.
Be merciful.
Let's follow the others.
Before I go to sleep, I listen to music.
I'll pray for them.
Those benches are mine.
Was that a nice trip?
You have to work together.
Show me your hand.
They're hunting dogs.
You should make a habit of brushing your teeth every meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom gathered his heart.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom stayed outside.
This is the king's most trusted counselor.
Did you buy this for her?
Go change your clothes.
Tom was really angry.
I'll cook for you.
I think we should hire him.
Where'd you get that?
Tom's a great doctor.
Tom's very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else do I get?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you more than you can imagine.
No one's gonna get hurt.
Tom gave Mary a handy watch.
I'm sure Tom added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice Mary wasn't at the party.
He's changing business.
It's too late to help you.
We were trying to hide it.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom's on his way up.
Tom might be able to set your car on fire.
Did you hear that?
What did they find?
You lied to me in your eyes.
I'm gonna go find her.
I wanted to change.
They're listening.
I wasn't aware Tom did that.
If I ignore him, he'll leave.
They'd just stop Tom.
Maybe I should help her.
Don't touch the exhibits.
Maybe I can find her.
I've learned it by heart.
I have nothing to give you.
They found an isolated beach and spent the day there.
Nothing's changed.
Everyone was on strike.
He's a little deaf, so speak up.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom's heading south.
Love is like oxygen.
You're for now.
That's a very simplistic explanation.
The breakfast snacks are refreshing.
Because the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read it.
We'll make it work.
It's too risky to fight them on their own.
Wasn't it awful?
Tom tried to kill himself yesterday.
I despise his rude attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
They set him up for murder.
There's no answer from him.
We're all eager to see the movie.
It's simple.
I'm coming for her.
Tom wore his shirt at the same time.
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Let's not fight, shall we?
Dinner was real good!
Control yourself.
Multiplication is commutable, and sharing is not.
I'm in a hurry.
Tom took off his hat and gave it to him.
We're running out of oil.
I don't think Tom's gonna go.
Whose manuscript is this?
Did you see what it says in the newspaper today?
What did we do wrong?
Tom drinks three to six coffees a day.
Tom was loud and loud.
It was Bether.
Tom started to cry.
I'll ask you to stay for a while.
We're watching two goats.
I see Tom every day.
Everyone showed up for her.
Maybe Tom will die by tomorrow.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll be there in time.
Tom was pissed off.
Limenka is empty.
There's a fever in the fridge.
Why did you ask me?
Why did you pretend to hear about Tom the first time?
Tom loosened his arm.
Einstein considered himself a philosopher.
My money's clouded my glasses.
So it wasn't.
I didn't mean to say that.
Tom wasn't with me.
That's a fact.
We all cheered up for her.
Haven't you seen the Alo flag?
Take a break!
I told you it would be hard to do.
I think I found one like that.
You're gonna try, aren't you?
Tom's been out of food all week.
I don't understand you.
Although I am a devout man, I am a man.
Tom's sorry he's late.
Are there any problems I need to know about?
Tom needs to work.
I can't find her either.
Don't be so angry.
A lot of people are hunting.
He deserves the reward.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Where are we headed?
Tom basically does what Mary does.
We need to look into something.
Tom, open your eyes.
They can't get out.
That's actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have much time.
Tom was on the phone.
How are you feeling?
Tom was drinking in silence.
I'm hit!
Who said anything?
Tom started saying something, but Mary kept it quiet.
We met in mine.
How was Tom?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
I had nothing to drink.
I turned the whole city around looking for Dom.
Let him go.
Nightlife is better in New York.
Please come in.
The drug has to drink on an empty stomach.
Tom's not involved.
Looks like it's our job not to let that happen.
Why is the universe black?
It's my fault.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Tom said the house was cursed.
I made you an everlasting bread.
Pigs from marzipan don't hug.
That's what I'm talking about.
Tom was mad at Mary.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
That's what Tom's up to.
Tom may come today.
Tom doesn't make a difference between reality and fantasy.
Tom's a hero.
Tom doesn't have the power to will.
Will you help?
Don't make me unconscious.
Tom wasn't home when I got home.
I still don't get it.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Come on, now.
You'd better die on your feet than live on your knees.
They're digging a hole.
Tom seems sad.
I've been home all night.
We got out of there at eleven o'clock.
You can ask me what you want.
You used to love Boston.
We don't have that kind of money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of relatives are you?
You deserve a higher salary.
You only got 65.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human because it's from another dimension.
They're bothering me.
What time is it?
I found the room empty.
I've already written my part of the report.
I don't think they've invented a cure yet.
Each member must be present.
You didn't understand her joke.
This is the proudest snow I've ever seen.
He's hoping to go abroad.
Tom is obviously frustrated and depressed.
You must have jumped.
Who would want Tom dead?
Do you understand what his name is?
It doesn't seem to help.
You have to let me deliver a message to Tom.
Where's my golf bag?
Read these instructions.
We're not criminals.
The flour is made of wheat.
Don't touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom disagrees with Mary on the subject.
You're right.
I'll go.
Today's my sixteenth birthday.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's go back to Boston.
You look familiar to me.
I'll eat it.
Well, then I'll go to Tom's.
Did Tom buy presents?
You two are very sweet together.
You're beautiful.
Tom and Mary had fun together.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
What's happiness?
Dan hurt Linda's dog.
You broke your key bone while you were playing.
I think Tom's funny.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
I was there with Tom.
The show's over.
You can use this pen.
Tom's blind.
Do you really believe this guy's a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was naked.
This isn't an easy decision.
His prophecy has been fulfilled.
I can't believe Tom's dead.
And then something wonderful happened.
Tom adheres to a strict vegetarian diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please report them.
I have to call her.
He asked me if I was cooking something.
Watch out for the road.
We'll stop by the way.
I heard Tom climb.
This tastes like tea.
I wouldn't spend any nerves on that.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look angry?
So didn't you know how to play the piano?
It's time to close.
Let me go.
The stone ran down the hill.
She went to the hairdresser.
Tom's so crazy.
Come on!
It doesn't make his heart.
You don't have to comment.
The chicken is raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom's not that young.
That time, Tom was swimming.
Penguin's very sweet.
You're such a jerk.
Sorry, but we don't accept credit cards.
You were all right here.
They look awful.
I could make it easier for you.
Put the phone down.
I'd never get out of the house after the papal.
I think Tom's a cedillac.
He's sick of a terrible infection and the ovaries are coming.
I don't need advice.
This doesn't work.
It doesn't matter.
Tom's headed for the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
He's always acting weird.
We'll hang them.
Now is probably not the right time for this.
I'll be back in a minute.
I have a list of her.
That was very stupid.
How'd it go, Tom?
I have other things I should do.
Believe in justice!
What does Tom say?
Why don't we take everything?
Who took the money?
I'm not incapacitated.
Tom bought two tickets and a bag of popcorn.
You're very influential.
I have a message from him.
Bring the kids home to dinner.
Why don't we make a cupcake?
I need a secretary.
This girl is the smartest.
I had to protect Tom.
This is really relaxing.
Call him now.
Hold on to the subject.
She really wants to talk.
I have questions on the tone.
This is an interesting, funny and even shocking story.
I'll call Tom later.
Every language looks different in the world.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put on your pajamas.
This way.
This is a holy land.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to come drink with us.
Let's just not talk anymore.
My birthday's in July.
We have everything.
How much is a beer?
Tom said he didn't know how to play tennis.
Where did you find her, live?
This was at the top of the shop.
I'm done with that.
We can't give up.
We were under attack.
He's a godless man.
Tom hasn't talked to me since we broke up.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you found someone else.
I don't know if I can sit or run.
Don't you think it's hot enough for December?
I think Tom's dying.
I'm wet.
Are you messing with him?
We just found them.
I bit my tongue.
I'm calling.
I lost my sense of time.
This island is an American territory.
Put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
I baked the cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he doesn't like Mary.
How many people are in this room?
I've already thought about it.
I would do anything for her.
Somebody's got to plant them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom's definitely not happy.
I haven’t called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You've got your eyelids.
Are you still there?
You're predictable.
I was a little sloppy.
