Cumulative incidence in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of cases of coronary disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, which confirms that, although at different stages according to the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly across all countries.
Based on Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should improve their preparation for a wave of patients with COVID-19 who will require medical care and, in particular, intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a conglomerate of cases of unknown etiology pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Center for Control and Prevention of China's Diseases reported that the causing agent was a new coronavirus now known as coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence to date indicates that 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild disease, i.e. an infection of respiratory tract with or without pneumonia, and that most are recovered.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves towards a more serious disease requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases develop a critical disease requiring intensive care.
Mortality in patients hospitalized by COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we examined trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union or the European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (RU) and compared them with those of the province of Hubei, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and RU countries with Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and RU countries
After China, the COVID-19 continued to spread geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world continue to be that of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In its edition of 5 March 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were registered in France on 24 January 2020 in persons who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 were detected in the 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (RU), according to which between 31 December 2019 and that date, 39 768 cases and 1727 deaths had been recorded, of which 17 750 cases and 1441 deaths had occurred only in Italy.
Obtaining the accumulated amount and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), reports of cases of COVID-19 reported in each country of the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, are updated every day at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to examine the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with those of Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative incidence of cases of COVID-19 truncated to 14 days; in this way, we took into account the natural course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA and RU country during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the accumulated number of cases reported in each country as of 15 March 2020, at 8:00 a.m., compared with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in EU/EEA and RU countries
Trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases lasting 14 days in EU/EEA and RU countries in general followed that of the province of Hubei (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the RU in general, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase by around 21 February and then significantly increased by about 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA and RU countries showed upward trends in the cumulative incidence of similar COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the accumulated number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and RU countries, compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It notes that, on 15 March at 8:00 a.m., other 15 EU/EEA and RU countries had already recorded a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the RU.
The trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is advancing at a similar pace in all countries.
This is so despite the different stages in which countries, variations in national public health responses and, possibly, different definitions in countries and different protocols to select patients to be tested to confirm COVID-19, including delayed tests.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of patients with COVID-19 required intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of cases of COVID-19 in a hospital or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6 % and 1 % of cases, respectively (data not shown).
However, they should be systematically collected to complement current monitoring data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010–11 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care beds and intermediate care in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds every 100,000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of intensive care and intermediate care per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010–11).
Model scenarios relating to the saturation of medical care capacity, with calculations for each EU/EEA country and the RU of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization cases associated with a risk >90 % of intensive care bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
Since cases have so far been congregated in certain regions of EU/EEA and RU countries, and hospitals and intensive care units are normally provided to a defined regional catch population, information on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available at the level of the Nomenclature of territorial statistical units 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly advancing in the EU/EEA and the RU.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore prepare for a sustainable Community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring medical care and, in particular, intensive care, such as in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in the rapid risk assessment of ECDC, it is essential to adopt a quick, proactive and comprehensive approach to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a change of a containment approach to a mitigation, as the rapid increase expected in the number of cases may not give sufficient time to decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response in a timely manner if not implemented.
The rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures necessary to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short period of opportunity during which countries have the opportunity to deepen their control efforts to halt the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to reduce the pressure on the health system.
If this is not done, it is likely that the health systems of other EU/EEA countries will face a wave of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days and weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (SARS-CoV-2), has so far caused the death of 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and other parts of the world, resulting in a catastrophe for humans.
Similarly to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from the murceliac and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has less severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more communicable and affects people more than young people and more men than women.
In response to the increasing number of publications on the emerging disease, the purpose of this article is to provide a timely and comprehensive analysis of the research theme, which is being developed rapidly.
We will address the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions have not yet been answered, we hope that this analysis will help understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival of 25 January 2020 has become an unheard and impeccable memory for all Chinese people, who were urged to stay home during the entire festival and for several weeks more due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus has almost the same name as the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) called it SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the country and almost 50 countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients reported to be high and more than 3000 patients killed.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number" and that it is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months more than 200 scientific articles have been published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report of 7 January 2020, which determined the sequence of the isolated virus of multiple patients.
The aim of this analysis is to sum up the progress in research on this rapidly developing new subject.
When possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by a CoV, the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS, a outbreak in 2012).
We will also consider what is known so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as some crucial questions that have not yet been answered.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been considered non-fatal pathogens for humans, mainly causing about 15 per cent of the common colds 4.
However, in this century, we have met twice with highly pathogenic coronary viruses in humans, i.e. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an original outbreak in China, in 2003, and in Saudi Arabia, in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with fearsome morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is the third by coronavirus of which is recorded in the history of mankind.
As shown in figure 1.1, conglomerates of pneumonia of unknown origin were reported for the first time on 31 December 2019 from Wuhan to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the sequence of the coronavirus was known.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was reported in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On 20 January, the infection of medical care providers was reported, suggesting that transmission between humans was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was quarantined and all public transport was suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that only 21 of the 41 patients with confirmed cases had had direct contact with the Wuhan marine market that was considered the source of infection of an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, the WHO declared a global health emergency.
By the date of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and almost 50 countries around the world (Figure 2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final dimension and severity of the outbreak cannot yet be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentre study of 8866 patients, including 4021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic described below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-COV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly people from 30 to 65 years of age.
Almost half (47.7%) of infected persons were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men more (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 expanded in conglomerates mostly in Hubei and its surroundings.
On average, 5 days (from 2 to 9) were between the appearance and diagnosis of COVID-19.
The mean incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2).
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 days (between 4.8 and 13).
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95 % CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected persons increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, which coincided with the time of mass mobilization prior to the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate in confirmed cases was 1.44 % (95 % CI: 1.10-1.86 %), and the adjusted mortality rate in all patients was 3.06 % (95 % CI: 2.02-4.59 %).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large and enveloped viruses that contain a single-sensical chain RNA.
They can be divided into four types, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and deltacoronavirus are the ones that infect humans.
The spindle glycoprotein (S) of the spindle binds to its cell receptors, the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) and the dipeptidel peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released to the cytoplasm; after the replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA, together with the glycoproteins of the envelope and the nucleocapside proteins, forms vesiculars containing virions, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was announced on 10 January 2020.
It was found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus with a genetic identity of more than 99.98 % in 10 sequential samples taken from the original site of the outbreak: the Huaan marine market of Wuhan.
The SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to the SARS-CoV than the MERS-CoV.
With an electronic transmission microscope, the SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultradelegated sections of the human respiratory epithelial.
Human ACE2 was determined to be a receiver of SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 S protein is more humanly bound to ACE2 than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less serious infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by the orf3b and a secret protein encoded by the orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b could have a role in viral pathogenesis and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, the orf8 does not contain any known domain or functional reason.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., revealed the structure of a complete human ACE2 chromium microscopy in resolution 2.9 Å, in combination with the transporter amino acid B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed compositions, was assembled as a dimerium, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could combine two S proteins, which provides evidence for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic day for the drug study in order to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The origin and the intermediate guest
It is known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in turtles and were transmitted to humans by means of civets and camels, respectively.
In a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it was considered to be the native guest of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is identical in 96% to two coronaviruses similar to SARS of bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is still unknown what an intermediate guest helped the virus to cross the species barrier to infect humans, and the route of transmission continues to dilute.
Ji, et al., proposed to snakes as carriers of the human murcelilag virus, which involved homologous recombination within protein S.
According to a study, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolines (long choic mammals that feed on hermies and are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine) are a potential intermediate guest of SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99% genetic homology in a pangoline-detected coronary virus and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1 % difference spread by the total of two genomes remains a major difference; therefore, final results are expected to provide concrete evidence (Figure 33).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still widely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MES-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and for up to 5 days at less than 20 °C with a moisture of 40-50 %.
SARS-CoV-2 could possess similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol at 75 %, a disinfectant with chlorine, perchloric acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective in deactivation of the virus.
The entire human population in general has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new coronavirus.
So far, no detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been announced.
Therefore, we can only use previous studies with other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
In general, after the virus invades the guest, the first is recognized by the guest's innate immune system through the patron recognition receptors (PRRs), including the C-type lectin receptors, the Toll-type receptors (TLRs), the NOD-type receptors (NLRs) and the RIG-I-type receptors (RLRs).
Through different ways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of the I-type interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein can help the virus escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response is added to the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
T CD4+ cells stimulate cells B to produce antibodies specific to the virus, and T CD8+ cells directly kill cells infected with the virus.
Cooperative T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help defense cells.
However, coronaviruses can inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing the apoptosis of T cells.
Humorous immunity, which includes supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, the isolated antibodies of a recovered patient neutralized the MRS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exaggerated reaction of the immune system locally generates a large number of free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, multi-organism failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by conglomerates, is more likely to affect older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised to be more likely to become infected than others.
The estimated mean of the SARS-CoV-2 incubation period is 1 to 14 days, mostly between 3 and 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average and oscillated from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2) based on a population of 8866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adapt the effective quarantine period according to the most accurate incubation period; this is how asymptomatic infected persons are expected to transmit the virus to others.
As usual, people exposed to the virus or infected should normally remain in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The fever is usually the main and initial symptom of the COVID-19, which can be accompanied by any other symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, dyspnoea, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat pain, kidney pain, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dysnea or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In serious cases, patients rapidly evolved to develop acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with respiratory disease or symptoms and acute fever, even without pulmonary abnormalities in imaging studies, should be tested for an early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 indicated that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for the fever, 76% for the drought, 55% for the dyspnoea and 3% for the diarrhoea; 8% of patients needed respiratory assistance.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family conglomerate and a conglomerate caused by the transmission of an asymptomatic person.
Comparably, a 2012 demographic study showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnoea (55%) as main symptoms.
However, 80% of them required respiratory assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19 and in line with the highest mortality rate of COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, it was demonstrated that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnoea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25%) and throat pain (13%-25%) were the main symptoms and respiratory assistance were needed in approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
By 14 February, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2% when the confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
Similarly, SARS mortality by November 2002 was 10 per cent in 8096 confirmed cases.
For MRS, according to a June 2012 demographic study, mortality was 37% in 2494 confirmed cases.
In a previous study, it was reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 was high and raised to 6.47 with a confidence interval (IC) of 95% from 5.71 to 7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 was only oscillated between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV as regards symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The previous figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater spread capacity than MRS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but its mortality is lower than those of the latter two.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than those of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance in conglomerates usually occurs within the same family or from the same meeting or vehicle, as a cruise.
Patients usually have travel or residence history in Wuhan and other affected areas or contact with infected persons or patients within the two weeks prior to their appearance.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients with high blood pressure in the hospital can re-contract the virus, a warning signal that quarantine time should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced amount of white blood cells in peripheral blood (especially lymphocytes) in the early stage.
For example, lymphopenia was observed with a white blood cell count of <4×109/l, including a count of <1×109/l lymphocytes, and high levels of aminotransferase aspartate in 1099 patients with COVID-19.
Hepatic and muscle enzymes and myoglobin levels were high in the blood of some patients, and Reactive C protein and erythrocytic sedimentation were high in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the dimero-D level, a product of blood fibrin degradation, was high, and lymphocyte count was gradually reduced.
Anomalies are detected in thoracic radiographics of most patients with COVID-19, characterized by shade or opaque side-by-side blurry glass in the lungs.
Patients usually develop atypical pneumonia, acute pulmonary injury and acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA).
When SDRA occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously affect the gas exchange.
The dysfunction of Type I and Type II tumours decreases the surfactant level and increases surface tension, which reduces lung capacity to expand and increases the risk of pulmonary collapse.
As a result, the worst findings in chest X-rays are usually in parallel with the maximum severity of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed the dislocation of the neurocytes, the formation of a hyalin membrane and the infiltration of lymphocytes in the interstitial, and cynic multinucleated cells in the lungs of a patient who died because of the disease, which is similar to the pathology of a viral infection and of SDRA, and similar to that of patients with SARS and MRS.
The SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection using a chain reaction of polymerase with inverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China began to be used on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is essential and imperative for an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for the use of CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA between 20 × 10-18 mol/l and 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per microlitre of sample) using a graduated rod in less than an hour that does not require complex instruments.
Fortunately, the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience if it occurs in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronary virus, physicians may mostly provide support care to patients with COVID-19, while testing with a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed before for the treatment of other coronary viruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current or potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, recovered patient plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
The plasma of recovered patients was proposed for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies compete to see who first develops antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
The SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at the beginning and probably also attacks, to a lesser extent, other organs expressing the ACE2, such as the digestive system and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the greatest threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory assistance is critical to relieve symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation according to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need extrabody membrane oxygenation (OEC), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique that is used to treat potentially fatal heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of the functions of vital organs are also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Cytokines storm is known to be the result of an exaggerated immune system reaction in patients with SARS and MERS.
The cytokines storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a huge number of free radicals that are the main cause of the SDRA and the multi-organism failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal IL6 receptor antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm are the modulation of the immune response directed by T cells; the blocking of IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF; the inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; a suppressor of the 4-way cytokine signal, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe pulmonary lesions in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the other hand, they may cause serious side effects, in particular osteonecrosis, which affect the prognosis significantly.
However, careful use of low to moderate doses of corticosteroids has been recommended for patients with COVID-19 in critical conditions.
No antiviral therapy has been established on the date of this analysis.
However, the efficacy of remedesivir, a nucleotide analogue administered intravenously in a US patient with COVID-19, has been established.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated the potential for inhibiting other viruses with monochatenary RNAs, such as MERS and SARS.
On the basis of these, Gilead has provided the compound to China to carry out a couple of tests in people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and there is great expectation of the results.
In addition, baricitib, interferon alfa, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicinal products used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of recovered patients and antibody generation
The blood extraction of patients who recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients who contracted the same disease or to protect healthy people so that they do not contract the disease is not something new.
In fact, recovered patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in the blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight the pathogens and other foreign objects, and recognize certain molecules in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.
On this basis, plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral load and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, it is necessary to verify and clarify this to propose the method for its large-scale use until specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-associated disadvantages should be considered in good faith.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate immune response and cause cytokines release syndrome, possibly leading to fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and plasma demand is high to treat patients in critical conditions.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies at sufficient speed to combat a global pandemic.
It is therefore more important and practical to isolate cells B of recovered patients and identify the genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or seek effective antibodies against the essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend largely on a combination of several components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis of a disease according to MCT theories.
Most of the effective components remain unknown or inaccurate, as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, MCT has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, it was determined that Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules are effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The main recovery rates in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 were observed in several provinces of China that used MCT in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used MCT in only about 30% of their patients with COVID-19, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a fairly approximate comparison, as many other impact factors, such as the amount and severity of patients, should be included in the assessment.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing Western Medicine Treatment (MO) with only the combined treatment of MO and MCT.
They found that the time needed for recovery of body temperature, the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization were significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group alone.
What is more surprising is that the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only (7.4% vs 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only (8.8% vs 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the MCT remain to be expected for more well-controlled trials on larger scales and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterise the mechanism of actions and determine the effective components of MCT treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients with suspicion or confirmation of COVID-19 are generally very afraid of highly contagious and even fatal disease, and people in quarantine also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, the symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as the adverse effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can cause more anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric morbidities were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies.
The tracking of contacts and mandatory quarantine, as part of public health responses to the outbreak of COVID-19, can make people feel more nervous and guilty about the effects of infection, quarantine and stigma on their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be given to patients with COVID-19, suspects and persons in contact with them, as well as to the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the training of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and precise updates on SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and treatment plans and the use of electronic devices and professional applications to avoid close contact between individuals.
They are essential effective vaccines to break down the transmission chain of animal and human reservoirs infected to susceptible guests, and they often complement antiviral treatment in the control of outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-based vaccines to generate strong neutralising antibodies and long-term or immune antibodies that protect against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines with live viruses have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these possible vaccines in older people and fatal stimulation models and their protection against zoonotic virus infection should be determined before a clinical study is started.
This is probably due to the expiry of SARS 17 years ago and no new cases have been registered since then.
However, there are still cases and conglomerates of MRS sporadicly in the Middle East that are spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MRI using deactivated viruses, DNA plasmas, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune people is an urgent and decisive task to control the current pandemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome the difficulties due to the long period (18 months on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and the dynamic variations of the coronary viruses.
Since it is a new disease, COVID-19 has recently begun to manifest its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can be recovered gradually without sequelae.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a predictive model for the disease is essential for health agencies to be able to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the predictive status of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the SARS forecast, which also proved to be correct for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred mostly in persons aged 30 to 65 years and 47.7% of these patients were over 50 years of age in a study of 8866 cases, as described above.
Patients who required more intensive care had underlying comorbidities and complications and were significantly larger than those who did not require them (with mean age 66 versus 51), suggesting that age was a predictive factor of the development of patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia.
Heart events were also the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to also be able to join positive ACE2 colangiocytes, which may cause hepatic dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and underlying diseases are strongly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of reactive protein C (PCR) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a possible predictive factor for the disease, the response to therapy and final recovery.
In addition, the correlation between the PCR level and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has been proposed.
In addition, a high level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict patient development.
These enzymes are strongly expressed in several organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.
They therefore constitute traditional markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: chest radiography and temporary progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with the other symptoms for predicting clinical detachments and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are commonly used as adjuvant therapy for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory harm.
Since the use of high doses of corticosteroids was extended in patients with severe SARS, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis with permanent incapacity and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for a short period of time in patients with COVID-19.
Mental stress: As described earlier, during the outbreak of COVID-19, many patients have experienced extraordinary stress, as in general they endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty, and attended the death of close relatives and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychotherapy and long-term support to these patients to help them recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological characteristics than those of SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can be effectively replicated in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms at the early stage of infection, as is the case with other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, early-stage or incubation infected patients may produce a large number of viruses during their daily activities, making it extremely difficult to control the epidemic.
However, it was considered that the transmission of SARS-CoV would occur when patients were severely ill, while the transmission would mostly not occur in the early phase.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more serious and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
Efforts are currently under way in China, including the closure of Wuhan and the surrounding cities and the continuing quarantine of almost all the population with the hope of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures are causing significant economic and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the deceleration of the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic forecast, the outbreak will be completed by March and the descending phase will last 3 or 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., believed that the COVID-19, which appears to be significantly more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the evolution of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world ' s population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both nasal and pharyngitis in patients who had recovered and had left the hospital 2 weeks before, indicating that the newly identified virus could become an influenza-like cyclical episode.
However, promising signs have been seen in China given the decrease in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies could be in operation.
Originally it was predicted that the Ebola would cause up to one million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through quarantine and strict isolation, disease control has been achieved.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is weakened in terms of infection and is eventually eliminated or converted into a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and the MRS is given below (Figure 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through the toes or scarves, and possibly also through direct contact with contaminated materials with the virus.
The virus was also detected in the faeces, creating a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent 138 case study reported that 41% of cases were possibly caused by infections in nosocomials, including 17 patients with other previous diseases and 40 health care providers.
Care should therefore be taken to protect people, especially health care providers, social workers, relatives, colleagues and even transmissibles in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense that could be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of masks; the use of surgical masks and masks with N95 (series number 1860) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the liquid drops of a potentially infected person from passing through the air or joining the surfaces, from where they could be transmitted to other persons.
However, only the N95 (series number 1860) masks can protect against the inhalation of viriones as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of the viriones can completely penetrate them; SARS-COV-2 is similar to SARS-COV in size and both measure approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate up to five stacked surgical masks, medical care providers should use N95 masks (series number 1860) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical care providers should use isolation belts to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected himself with SARS-CoV-2 despite having used a N95 mask; it is possible that the virus entered his body through his flaming eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should also use transparent protective gloves or glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly suggested that the population wash hands with more disinfectant soaps than usual, try to stay at home in voluntary quarantine and limit contact with people who may be infected.
Three feet is considered to be a proper distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-COV-2 appeared as a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-COV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should have caused great alarm in China for its experience with SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was not until 19 January 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control calmed citizens saying that the new virus had a low level of contagion and limited reproductive capacity among humans, and that there would be no problem in preventing and containing the disease.
This message was a notable relief to the public alarm, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical time to contain the disease at least in Wuhan was wasted.
China's disease control agencies should learn from this hard lesson and make decisive improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more cautious when making public announcements, since each word is important to citizens and may change their attitude or decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from clinics instead of waiting for the formal reports of doctors or officials; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain a possible epidemic in their early stages, rather than trying to calm the public; and (4) be more regular in the implementation of adapted and effective simulations to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and to test and improve the response system of society periodically.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and about 50 countries around the world at the time of this analysis.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are also many similarities between the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has generated the feeling of reappearance of SARS.
However, there are some notorious differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for containing the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects more people than young people and more men than women, and severity and mortality are also greater in older people than in young people.
SARS has greater mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus although they do not present symptoms, while patients with SARS generally do so when they are severely ill, which causes a much greater difficulty to contain the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widespread than SARS-CoV.
The regular ARN test for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, cured patients can give positive results in the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of the spread of the virus.
Given the rapid progress made in the COVID-19 research, a number of important issues remain to be resolved, such as:
Where did the SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of the genetic homologous between SARS-CoV-2 and two coronation viruses similar to SARS were found, it is still not possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from the murcules.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original guest, let's say, the mosquitoes, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to paragraphs 1 and 2, it is not possible to stop the transmission efficiently, and the burst can revive at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical evidence have shown that SARS-CoV-2 joins the ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also join the cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is not possible to achieve a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically while transmitting among humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, will it be extinguished like SARS or will it be periodically resurrected like flu?
Although it may take some time, it is essential to seek answers to these and many other questions.
However, at any cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal life.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have led to the coexistence of the coronaviruses and their guests, including human beings, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, it was known that two human coronation viruses caused mild diseases, such as common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have reversed the coin by revealing how devastating and deadly a human coronary infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Central China at the end of 2019 put the coronavirus in the center of attention again and surprised us with a high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to your brother, SARS-CoV.
Human coronavirus infection is a zoonose and it would be useful for us to know the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses.
Most human coronaviruses have their origins in murceliacs, in which they are not pathogens.
Intermediate reservoir guests are also known for some human coronaviruses.
Identifying animal guests has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
In addition, investigating the interactions between coronaviruses and animals guests could provide important information on the pathogen of coronaviruses in humans.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the existing knowledge about the seven human coronation viruses, with emphasis on the history of their discovery, as well as on their zoonotic origins and on the interspecies transmission.
Significantly, we compared and contrast the different human coronaviruses from the perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
The current disease epidemic by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is analyzed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful guest changes and the implications of the evolution of the virus in the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronavirus belongs to the Coronaviridae family, which includes a group of positive monochatenary RNA virus with envelope.
These viruses, which host the largest genome, from 26 to 32 kilobases, among the RNA viruses, were called "coronavirus" because of their morphology, because of the form of crown they have under an electronic microscope.
As for its structure, the coronaviruses have unsegmented genomes that share a similar organization.
About two thirds of the genome contain two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into replica polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including spiga (S), spindle (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A series of specific ancillary proteins of each line are also encoded by different lines of coronavirus.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified in four species (alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus), including the betacoronavirus genus containing most human coronaviruses and subdivided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
Philogenetic evidence has shown that murceliacs and rodents are the source of genes of most alpha-coronavirus and beta-coronavirus, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-coronavirus and delta-coronavirus.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly crossed the species barriers and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronation viruses are known.
These include HCV-229E and HCV-NL63 are alphacoronavirus.
The other five betacoronaviruses are HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as common cold or diarrhoea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MRS-CoV and the recently identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe respiratory infection of the lower respiratory pathways in a relatively higher number of patients, with a higher probability of developing acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of the HCV-229E, B814, was isolated from the nasal secretion of patients with common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies on HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, which cause autolimited symptoms.
In fact, until the outbreak of SARS, it was a widely accepted concept that the human coronation virus infection is generally harmless.
The outbreak of SARS occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating in the current history and infected more than 8,000 people, with a crude mortality of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) caused a persistent epidemic in the Arab Peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new human coronation virus 2019 (2019-nCOV), which was subsequently called SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the disease epidemic in the course of the coronation virus 2019 (COVID-19), which has cost more than 3120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of 3 March 2020.
The alarm has been ringing and the world must prepare for the approaching SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven human coronaviruses have a zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Several lines of evidence support the evolutionary origin of all human coronaviruses in the murceliacs, in which viruses are well adapted and are not pathogens, but present great genetic diversity.
The epidemic of COVID-19 has posed huge medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Traceting the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses provides a framework for understanding natural history, impulse force and interspecies jumping constraints.
This could also guide or facilitate the search for the reserve and intermediate animal and amplifier guests of the SARS-CoV-2, which would have important implications for the prevention of future spread.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the zoonotic origins, the transmission between species and the pathogen of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we highlight and analyze the common theme that the parental viruses of human coronation viruses are usually not pathogens in their natural reservoir guests, but become pathogens after transmission between species to a new guest.
We also look at the trend of human coronation viruses, in which the increase in transmissibility usually leads to a decrease in pathogenesis.
The evolution of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also analysed in this context.
The coronation of animal viruses has been known since the end of the 1930s.
Prior to the first isolation of the B814 strain of HCV-229E from the nasal secretion of patients who had contracted a common cold, different coronaviruses had been isolated in different infected animals, such as the pave, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In recent decades, seven human coronation viruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discoveries of human chronology coronaviruses (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first HPov-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory pathways of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and then adapted to grow in cellular lines WI-38 of the lung.
Patients infected with HCV-229E had symptoms of common cold, such as headache, dizziness, general malaise and throat pain, with fever and cough in 10~20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and later passed serious in breast-feeding mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCV-229E, whose symptoms are identical to those of infections by other respiratory tract pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCV-229E and HCV-OC43 are distributed by the world and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by a disease period of about 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients had a serious infection of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", caused the first pandemic caused by a well documented human coronary virus in the history of mankind, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third human coronary virus that was discovered.
The first case of SARS occurred at the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8096 reported deaths with 774 deaths and spread across many countries and continents.
Apart from the super-propagators, it was estimated that each case could cause approximately two secondary cases, with a 4-7-day incubation period and the appearance of the maximum viral load on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, general malaise and chills, followed by dysnea, cough and difficulty breathing as late symptoms.
Lympopenia, impaired liver function and high level of quinase creatinine are common abnormal results in SARS laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, spread of epithelial cells and an increase in macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30% of patients later require intensive care and mechanical respiratory assistance.
In addition to the lower respiratory pathways, several organs, including gastrointestinal tube, liver and kidney, can also be infected in these severe cases, usually accompanied by a storm of cytokines, which could be fatal, particularly in immunodepressed patients.
The virus was first isolated from the open-air lung biopsy of a family of the initial patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been made to investigate the human coronaviruses.
The HCV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was determined that it was prevalent in young children, older adults and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presentation of corse, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal sample taken from an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed by the world.
HCV-NL63 has been estimated to cause approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its maximum incidence occurs in early summer, spring and winter.
The HCV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crop.
In the same year, the HCV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and bronchiolitis acquired in the community, it was reported that HCV-HKU1 was associated with acute asthma exacerbations.
Like HCV-NL63, HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 was worldwide and caused mild respiratory diseases.
These four human coronaviruses acquired in the community have been well adapted to humans and, in general, they are less likely to change to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred due to unknown causes, as in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCV-NL63, which has recently been reported to have caused severe respiratory infection in lower routes in China.
In general, when these human coronaviruses acquire the ability to transmit efficiently and maintain themselves continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogens.
The MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who had developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most confirmed laboratory cases originate from the Middle East, cases have been reported with occasional infection to close contacts in several European and Tunisia countries.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MRS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MRS also developed acute renal failure, which is currently only given with MRS among diseases caused by human coronation.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2500 confirmed cases were recorded in a laboratory, with a high mortality of 34.4 %, which makes MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses for humans known to be known.
From mid to late December 2019, conglomerates of patients with pneumonia were detected in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, who were retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization declared the outbreak of infection of the lower respiratory pathways caused by SARS-CoV-2 an emergency of public health of international importance and also named the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a gross mortality of 3,4 %.
Significantly, mortality in Hubei, China is 4.2%, while it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which is presented as fever, cough and dyspnoea.
Diarrhoea has also been observed in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly evolve into acute respiratory difficulty syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to a 82% high nucleotide sequence homology, they are classified in different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
The SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic, but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, which could contribute to their rapid spread worldwide.
By comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronation viruses, similarities and differences of great interest are identified.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the course of the human coronation virus disease are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Secondly, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four human coronary viruses acquired in the community (i.e. HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are most commonly observed in human coronation virus infections acquired in the community, including the presentation of non-specific or mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of serious cases of COVID-19 is also observed as is the case with SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns of both the human coronaviruses acquired in the community and the SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronation viruses acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after human steps, as is the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like the other human coronation viruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in faecal samples.
If the fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 fulfils an important function, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, it should still be diluted in future studies.
It is also of particular interest to ascertain whether SARS-CoV-2 could show seasonality, as is the case with human coronaviruses acquired in the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable human-step propagation, will have an impact on the final deployment of the current outbreak of COVID-19.
The four human coronaviruses acquired in the community that cause mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it could also be true that humans have adapted well to these four human coronation viruses.
In other words, they could both be survivors of old human coronary pandemics.
Human coronaviruses that cause serious diseases in humans and humans that have developed serious diseases by human coronavirus have been eliminated.
In order for this to happen, human coronaviruses must be replicated in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract the guest's restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 and the more infected people persist, the more likely it will be to adapt completely to humans.
If properly adapted, its transmission to humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other measures to control the infection.
For many years, the four coronaviruses acquired in the community have circulated in human populations and caused common colds in immunocompetent people.
These viruses don't need an animal reserve.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and highly pathogenic MERS-CoV have not been well adapted to humans and their transmission among humans is unsustainable.
They need to maintain and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the opportunity to spread to human targets that are likely to be through one or more intermediate and amplifier guests.
SARS-COV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-COV and MERS-COV as well as the four human coronaviruses acquired in the community.
It is highly communicable as human coronation viruses acquired in the community, at least for the time being.
However, it is more pathogenic than human coronation viruses acquired in the community and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will be fully adapted to humans and will circulate among humans without an animal guest from a reservoir or intermediate.
Before analyzing the animal origins of human coronaviruses, we will be useful in examining the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and human coronavirus amplifiers.
An animal acts as an evolutionary guest of a human coronavirus if it hosts a closely related ancestor who shares a high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and is not pathogen in this guest.
Similarly, a guest in a reservoir houses a human coronation virus in a continuous and long-term manner.
In both cases, the guests are naturally infected and are natural guests of the human coronation virus or its parental virus.
On the other hand, if the human coronation virus was introduced into the mid-term guest just before or at the same time as its introduction into humans, it is not well adapted to the new guest and is usually pathogen.
The mid-term guest can act as the zoonotic source of infection in humans and perform the function of the amplifier guest by allowing the virus to be transitionally replicated and then transmitted to humans to amplify the scale of infection in humans.
A human coronation virus may cause an infection in the terminal guest if it cannot sustain transmission in the intermediate guest.
On the contrary, human coronaviruses can also adapt to the mid-term guest and even generate long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate guest becomes a natural reserve guest.
The epidemiological data retrospectively revealed that the initial case of SARS had been in contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent studies on seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of IgG anti-SARS-CoV compared with that of the general population.
Civetes of the masked palm trees (Paguma larvae) and a dog maple in live animal markets were the first identified carriers of viruses similar to SARS-CoV that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more cases of SARS were recorded after killing all citizens of the markets.
However, it was reported that wild and unexposed palm civettes were mostly negative in SARS-CoV, suggesting that hidden palm civettes would only act as an amplifier intermediate guest, but not as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of the different animals in Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that several small mammals also act as mid-term customers amplifiers of SARS-CoV cannot be dismissed.
They all seem to be SARS-CoV terminal guests.
Subsequent searches of the natural animal guest of SARS-CoV revealed a coronation virus of closely related mosquitoes, called CoV HKU3 of Rhinolophus related mosquitoes (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese herbicide shells.
These murceliacs are positive in anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other coronation viruses share a 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundations for the new concept that mosquitoes host emerging pathogens in humans.
Various coronaviruses similar to SARS (SL-CoV) have also been identified in murciliacs, but none, except one known as WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
The human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme is known to be the SARS-CoV receptor.
The WIV1 obtained from a fecal sample of murceliomas has been shown to use the ACE2 of murceliomas, cetaceans and humans as a receptor for entering cells.
Amazingly, the sweats of patients with validated SARS were able to neutralize the HIV1.
To date, the WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in murcilelags, which shares a 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that the WIV1 is not the direct parental virus of SARS-CoV and that murcelialoids are not the immediate reservoir guest of SARS-CoV.
According to the phylogenetic analysis, the MERS-CoV is categorised in the same group as the CoV-HKU4 murcilegago and the CoV-HKU5 murcilegago.
The coV-HKU4 Murciélago and the MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for the introduction of the virus.
The sequences of polymerase NRAs dependent on MERS-CoV RNA are phylogenetically closer to their beta-coronavirus counterparts identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, you can't find a live MERS-CoV in wild turtles.
The MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the CoV-HKU25 murcilegago, share a sequence homology of nucleotides of only 87%.
Therefore, Murciélago may not be the immediate reserving guest of the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that seropositive seropositive sero-positive antibodies of the MERS-CoV specifically, as well as camels originating in the Middle East in several African countries.
A MERS-CoV live identical to the virus found in humans isolates itself from the nosal exudation of dromedari, which further supports camels acting as guests of the MERS-CoV good faith reserve.
It should also be noted that there were generally mild symptoms, but a massive spread of the virus in camels infected for research with MERS-CoV.
Significantly, infected camels spread the viruses not only by respiratory means but also by fecal-oral means, which is also the main route for the spread of murceliac virus.
However, there are still questions, as many confirmed cases of MRS have no prior contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, which is reasonably attributed to the transmission between humans or by unknown means of transmission involving non-recognised animal species hosting MRS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide homology with a coronation virus of murciles, RaTG13, isolated from the Rhinolophus affinis murciles.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is too large to assign a parental relationship.
In other words, the mosquitoes may not be the immediate reserving guests of SARS-CoV-2 unless they are found in the future coronavirus of practically identical mosquitoes.
It is assumed that the intermediate animal guests of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the majorist marine market in Huaan, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a likely event of animal transmission to humans.
Several recent studies based on the metagenomic sequence have suggested that a group of small endangered mammals, known as pangolines (Manis javanica), could also host betacoronavirus ancestrals related to SARS-CoV-2.
The genomes of this new pangoline coronavirus share a 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to the RatG13, with an identity of approximately 90 % at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
They are grouped into two syllables similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a more common domain of association to the receptor (RBD) similar to SARS-CoV-2, with a 97.4% amino acid sequence.
In marked contrast, SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 RBDs are more divergent, despite a higher degree of sequential homology throughout the genome.
A previous study in diseased pangolines also reported the detection of viral contigos in lung samples, which are also related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of assembly and manual healing to generate a partial genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of the complete length viral genome.
We cannot dismiss the possibility that pangoline is one of the intermediate animal guests of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence that supports a direct origin in the SARS-CoV-2 pangoline due to the divergent sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-coronaviruses of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even lower than that between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-coronavirus pangoline related to SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in shellfish, pangoline and other mammals still needs to be established.
Although the highest sequential homology was found in the RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangoline, betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest complete genome sequential homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the beta-coronavirus RBDs of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is due to the convergence-mediated evolution of selectivity.
A counter-proposal advocates a recombination between the beta-coronaviruses of pangolines related to SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As a driving force in evolution, the recombination is extended between betacoronaviruses.
A conclusion on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reached.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the zoonotic origin of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCV-HKU1 was also studied.
Philogenetic evidence indicated that both HCV-NL63 and HCV-229E could have originated from murcilegae coronaviruses, whereas parental viruses of HCV-OC43 and HCV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It was reported that a coronation virus called ARCoV.2 (coronavirus of the Apalaches mountains) detected in a tricolored murceliac in North America had a close relationship with HCV-NL63.
On the other hand, the HCOV-229E was genetically related to another cornea virus called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, although it has also been suspected of camels as intermediate guests.
For more clarity, the knowledge available until the time of the animal origins of known human coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of events of transmission of human coronavirus between species in history.
When the HCV-OC43 crossed between species until infected humans from livestock in 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic occurred.
The transmission history between HCOV-229E species is not known with such precision.
Alphacoronaviruses of murcilelages have been found closely related to HCV-229E.
Among them is an alphacoronavirus of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of the mosquito virus to humans directly.
First, unlike the alpacas, humans could have contact with mosquitoes in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, humans have close contact with alpines.
Second, the alphacoronaviruses related to HPov-229E are different and non-pathogens in the mumps, while the alpha coronaviruses of the alpacas caused a outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alphacoronavirus has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas acquire human HCV-229E-related alphacoronavirus cannot be ruled out.
In fact, mosquitoes are the direct source of pathogen viruses in humans, such as the rabies virus, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus and the Hendra virus.
Therefore, it would not be too surprising for the mosquitoes to transmit the HCOV-229E to humans directly.
Alternatively, while alphacoronaviruses of murcieloids act as a genetic collection of the HCV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries could act as intermediate guests transmitting the viruses to humans, in particular in the case of the MRS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission between species, from mussels to dromedaries, and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MRS-CoV in the Murcielagos, is discovered with its initial identification, and has also been supported by subsequent findings.
It is evident that murceliacs contribute, with a profuse collection of virus species, to the exchange of genetic fragments between species and the transmission between species.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and great ability to fly, are all favourable conditions that make murcelials the ideal "virus spreader".
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been introduced into the dromedaries for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, which have become an intermediate guest, to be a stable and natural reserve guest.
The MRS-CoV causes very light disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Their sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain a terminal guest of the MERS-CoV, as transmission is unsustainable.
Compared to the role of camels in the transmission of the MERS-CoV, the role of the pangolines, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, pangoline beta-coronaviruses are highly pathogenic to the pangoline.
It is possible that they are a terminal guest of the beta-coronavirus related SARS-CoV-2, such as civilians in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several transmission possibilities between species of SARS-CoV-2 animals to humans should be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First, the mosquitoes could be the reservoir guest of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with the mosquitoes, through the slaughter or coal mining.
Second, pangolines could be one of the intermediate amplifier guests in which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through the slaughter and consumption of hunting meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A study of antibodies is needed in domestic and wild animals.
Thirdly, as mentioned earlier, the recombination and adaptation of the SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that is in contact with both murceliac and pangoline.
The search for animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to the different types of animal guests, three main factors in viral terms also play an important role in facilitating coronavirus crossing the species barriers.
Firstly, its relatively high rate of mutation in the RNA replication.
Compared to other monochatenary RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of the coronavirus could be considered "moderate" to "high", with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 replacements per year, on site 2, according to the phase of adaptation of the coronavirus to new guests.
Coronaviruses have an exorbitant read-checking system, whose elimination results in extremely high mobility and attenuation or even inviability.
Curiously, it is known that the nucleotide analogue referesivir suppresses the replication of the coronavirus by inhibiting this exorribonuclease and NRA polymerase-dependent.
Remedesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that have been tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of the coronary viruses are about a million times higher than those of their guests.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when the coronaviruses are not well adapted to the guest.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate appears to be lower, suggesting a higher level of human adaptation.
It is to be hoped that it has already adapted to another guest near humans.
In addition to the SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to the MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to the dromedary.
In theory, genetic derivatives are unlikely to cause vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 to lose their effectiveness rapidly.
Secondly, the long DNA genome of the coronavirus exercises additional plasticity in the modification of the genome for mutations and recombination and thus increases the likelihood of interspecies coexistence, which makes new coronaviruses appear when appropriate.
This is supported by the unique open open reading frames and the functions of the encoded proteins towards the 3' direction of the genome.
Thirdly, coronaviruses change randomly and frequently during RNA replication through a single "copy-choice" mechanism.
In a guest acting as a mixing vehicle, the chain change occurs frequently during the coronary DNA transcription.
Full length and subgenomic NRAs highly homologous could be recombined to generate new coronaviruses.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCV-HKU1 and HCV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses, such as murcilegago SL-COV and coV-HKU9 murcilegago.
Virus-hospital interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, the viral interaction with the guest receptor is another key factor that influences the interspecies transmission.
At present, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection in interspecies transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis of human and civic SARS-CoV isolates, it is believed that SARS-CoV experiences rapid adaptation in different guests, particularly with mutations in protein S RBD.
In general, the S protein RBD of a coronavirus interacts with the cell receptor and is intensely selected by the guest antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, the RBD is found in amino acids 318 to 510 in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 and its viral entry adapters.
The SARS-CoV RBD is capable of recognizing the ACE2 receptors of several animals, including murceliac, civette, mouse and maple dog, allowing transmission between virus species.
In fact, it was observed that only 6 residues of amino acids were different from the isolated strains of human viruses and civets in the RBD, and 4 of them are found in the reason of the connection to the receptor for interaction with the receptor of ACE2.
The CIVE SARS-COV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which could increase the affinity of the spice protein interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two substitutions of amino acids could be fundamental for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30 % difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein unit implies that the affinity of the S protein with human ACE2 could have changed.
In fact, a study of electronic chrymicroscopics indicates the affinity 10 to 20 times greater than that of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other corrigendum might be necessary for the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCV-NL63 also joins the ACE2, but with a different part of the S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidase N in HCV-229E and sialic acid 9-O-acetylated in HCV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans, after transmission between species from their animal guests.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of transmission between human coronavirus species is also determined by other factors of guest dependence and restriction.
The diversity of these guest proteins between humans and natural reservoir guests of human coronaviruses, such as mussels, dromedaries and rodents, could constitute an obstacle to the transfer of species.
Human coronaviruses must absorb the guest's dependency factors and subvert the guest's restriction factors to ensure the transmission of species is successful.
In this respect, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-guessed interaction must still be identified and characterized.
A comprehensive genomic survey of the customer's dependence and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology could prove beneficial.
New human coronation viruses: we're leaving from zero
The diversity of murceliac coronaviruses provides many opportunities for the emergence of new human coronaviruses.
In this sense, the murceliac coronavirus acts as the genetic collection of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of human coronation viruses and constitute two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes have the potential to radically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 has been considered important in human adaptation, as viruses of murcelialoids related to SARS-CoV were isolated, but it was determined that different ORF8 proteins were encoded.
An elimination of 29 characteristic SARS-CoV nucleotides was found in isolated strains at the start of the human epidemic.
This elimination divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes guest change.
In addition, SARS-CoV has possible recombination history with alpha and gammacoronavirus lines, which identified a large number of smaller recombinant regions in the NRA-dependent polymerase.
Recombination locations were also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV suffered recombination events between different lines, which occurred in dromedarys in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, in which human coronaviruses are recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection may contribute to unwanted changes in the viral genomes, which most likely results in the release of virus from the selection pressures exercised, for example by the guest ' s immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full length ORF4 in the HCV-229E prototype strain due to two nucleotide elimination.
Although an ORF4 intact in HCoV-229E-related mosquitoes and camels could be observed, alpine alpha coronavirus is an insertion of a single nucleotide, which causes a change in the frame.
Finally, although not least important, the evolution of the new human coronavirus is also driven by the selection pressure in its reserve guests.
No symptoms were detected or only mild symptoms were detected when coronational fungal infections were detected, indicating the mutual adaptation between coronational viruses and mussels.
Murciellas appear to be well adapted to the anatomical and physiological coronaviruses.
For example, defects in the activation of the proinflammatory response in the mussels effectively reduce the pathology caused by the coronavirus.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in mussels is eliminated due to the positive regulation of the inhibitory receptor of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of Class I molecules in the larger histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the high metabolic activity of mussels could suppress the replication of the coronavirus and affect the reading test of the exorribonuclease, resulting in the selection pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced to a new guest.
More pathogen coronavirus strains could also evolve by recombination, which would lead to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the adaptation to the guest.
It is therefore not a coincidence that three new human coronation viruses have appeared in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogens or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir guests, such as ants and camels.
They are strongly replicated without causing a strong immune response from the guest.
In this, there are the secrets why there are asymptomatic carriers and what causes serious cases of infection in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and the cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the pulmonary damage.
On the other hand, in the asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been dissociated from the replication of the coronavirus.
The same immune response detachment strategy could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is particularly strong in murceliacs.
Therefore, the administration of interferon type I, at least in the early phase of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of the NLRP3 inflammation in mussels is defective.
According to this reasoning, inhibition of inflammatory NLRP3 with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The appearance of SARS-COV-2 follows the general line that led to the appearance of SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Although a 95 % nucleotide homologous to SARS-CoV has been found, a 96 % nucleotide homologous to SARS-CoV-2 has also been found.
Although it has been determined that civilians and other animals on the market host the same SARS-CoV virus, no immediate interim guests of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Benchmarkly homologous pangoline betacoronaviruses to SARS-CoV-2 have been found, indicating that pangolines could act as one of the intermediate guests or that betacoronaviruses of pangolines could provide gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is done by man, whether deliberately or by accident.
Coronaviruses have recovered from the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in mosquitoes and other animals has deeply changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of human coronaviruses in human transmission.
The vast evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in the murciliacs and are transmitted to humans through intermediate guests.
Since SARS-CoV infection originates in contact with humans and civilians in the markets, closing the wet markets and killing civilians that had been in them could have been effective in stopping the SARS epidemic.
Following this same reasoning, pangolines should withdraw from the wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several lines of betacoronavirus of pangolines closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolines and other mammals remains to be diluted in future investigations.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been in the dromedaries for a long time.
These camels are an important transport tool, as well as a main source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local population.
They are widely distributed by the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MRS, as was done in China with wild animal markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other control measures for infection.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes that cause outbreaks could appear.
A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses, they are circulating in wild state.
In particular, the coronaviruses with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are great chances that these zoonotic coronation viruses will evolve and recombinate, which will result in the emergence of new coronation viruses that will be more communicable or deadly in the future in humans.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Based on the bad experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparation and response plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until the opportunity to spread is presented.
Although mosquitoes have many characteristics that favor the spread of viruses, human contact opportunities with mosquitoes and other wild species can be minimized if the population is educated to get away from them.
Continued monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of the coronavirus and its natural guests, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future outbreaks.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep humans away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces are still missing in the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
First of all, if the mosquitoes transmit an ancestral virus from SARS-CoV-2 to the pangolines, it will be interesting to examine under what circumstances the mosquitoes and the pangolines could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if turtles have a more direct role in human transmission, it must be determined how humans come into contact with turtles.
Thirdly, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate guest, it must be diluted how it interacts with the different species, including humans, turtles and pangolines.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, could be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, experimental surveillance and infection should be carried out.
Whether a murceliac, pangoline or other mammals, SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses are expected to be identified in their natural guests in the future.
Continued research in this area will dilute the evolving way of SARS-COV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of infection by the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this guidance included our experience and is a good reference to combating this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increase based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we respond to a comment on our guidelines and provide the most recent diagnostic criteria of "suspected" and "confirmed" according to the latest guidelines for the diagnostic and treatment of COVID-19 (seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused a outbreak, which is now officially known as coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) and the virus was called coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advice policy that was published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It's attracted much attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increase based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, the Directives for the Diagnostic and Treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have published a total of seven editions and some contexts have changed considerably.
Now, our director received a comment from Zhou et al., they presented a simple classification proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work added new evidence for our guidance and is also a valuable reference to this pandemic around the world.
We support your important work and express our gratitude.
However, its work also needs updating according to the latest guidelines for the diagnostic and treatment of COVID-19 (Seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected case it is necessary to combine any point of the characteristics of epidemiological background with two points of clinical manifestations to perform an exhaustive analysis, or three points of clinical manifestations should be met if there are no clear epidemiological backgrounds:
Epidemiological backgrounds: (1) travel or residence history in the city of Wuhan and remote areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) contact history with infectious cases of SARS-COV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) contact history with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan and remote areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) contact history with confirmed case groups (≥ 2 cases of fever or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small areas, such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) characteristics in COVID-19 infection images; (3) total white blood cell counts showing normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count at the early start stage.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with any characteristic of pathogens or serological tests in the following way: (1) evidence of real-time polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequence of the complete viral genome that shows high homogeneity to the newly recognized new coronavirus; (3) positive result for the specific IgM antibody and specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 in a zero test; or a change of the specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive, or an increase of title ≥4 times more in the recovery phase than in the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time polymerase chain reaction test to detect nucleic acid in blood samples or respiratory pathways was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
The detection of pathogens in blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020) editions; then serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
{NS}
In addition, there is more and more evidence that reminds us that we should be careful with patients with atypical asymptomatic and symptomatic symptoms.
Therefore, the Zhou et al. flow chart should be updated as they classified the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The score system should also be verified in other clinical studies and practices.
To conclude, we expect more direct evidence to emerge and we ask readers to send us their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspected case" and "confirmed case", we recommend seeking and complying with the latest guidelines of their countries of origin.
Our team will also update our guidelines in a timely manner to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the largest amount in one day
Bangladesh confirmed yesterday five new deaths due to COVID-19 in one day.
It's the greatest number of deaths in a day due to the virus.
Until yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of registered infected cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases remaining in their homes.
A total of 17 deaths have been reported.
At an online briefing, the director of the IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years of age, two between 51 and 60 years of age and one between 41 and 50 years of age.
He also said that two of the victims were Daca.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 pandemic.
One hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news outlet, that one of the deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, whom they were serving at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, the Minister of Transport by Road and Bridges of Bangladesh, Obaidul Quader, said that public transport would be suspended for longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
This suspension of public transport had initially begun on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential products, such as medical supplies, fuel and food, was still allowed.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh occurred on 8 March, were two men who returned from Italy and also the women of one of them.
As of March 19, these three were already recovered.
More than a million SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infections exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from the University of Johns Hopkins.
At least 52,000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The hit took place the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronary infections and Zambia had its first death related to the coronary disease.
North Korea said on Thursday that it was one of the few countries without coronary infections.
Yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours preceding 10:00 a.m. European Central Time (UTC-0800) of 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported, associated with at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, quoting data from the University of Johns Hopkins, that on Wednesday there were over 1,000 deaths in the United States caused by coronary infections.
Countries around the world have announced more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the closure of the city until 1 May.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would continue to receive their salaries without going to work until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of emergency for 15 days; the vote was adopted by 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one against.
Saudi Arabia extended the touch of falling in the holy cities of La Mecca and Medina throughout the day; previously, the touch of falling only lasted between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.
Thailand planned to implement a fall between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m.
Ohio governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended its order to stay at home until May 1.
Supermarkets in Australia lower the limits of the health paper by transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, the Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their hygiene paper purchase limits to two and a package by transaction in all the country's supermarkets, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also applied the limit of a package.
These restrictions were published as messages in the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the chains.
It was reported that consumers were being frightened of COVID-19 if people had to self-esteem themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchases of toilet paper to deliver home to a package by order.
These changes were introduced after the previous restriction of four transaction packages applied by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Coles, in his press release of March 8, reported that, with the application of the restriction of four packages, "many supermarkets still exhaust the product within one hour of delivery", and said that the demand "had no precedent", while ALDI, in a Facebook publication on Tuesday, said it was "unforeseen".
Sales went up with a "power increase" last week, according to a Woolworths voiceman.
The Costco supermarket in Canberra also limited the amount to two packages last week.
To further ease the shortage, Coles requested larger packages for suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI made stocks available for a special offer on scheduled Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers are trying to increase their livelihoods, but local council restrictions on truck delivery schedules make it difficult.
It provides for an increase in production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of stocks, some supermarkets cannot make the special offer on Wednesday.
In a report at News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retailer at the University of Technology University of Queensland, said that supermarkets supply stocks every night.
He stressed that the hygienic role is a voluminous article, which causes a low number of existences, and, when it is exhausted, leaves a large empty space in the barns, which intensifies the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea [that] if there was an abundance of the article in the barns, if products like toilet and disinfectant rolls could [bought] and there were large quantities, the panic would probably be minimized, said Russell Zimmerman by ABC News.
The recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives to Crap said last Wednesday that the stocks were exhausted.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures the Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, who manufactures Sorbent, pointed out that they were working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to maintain supply, according to News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property vendors offered free health care to the first bidder in the auctions in Melbourne, when less auctions were made because the buyers had free time on the weekend of the Day of the Worker.
The publication of NT News on Thursday, a daily newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page leaflet designed to be cut and used as a toilet paper.
Supermarkets at first showed reactions to impose restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia of 3 March, in which they said they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also have a lot of demand, including masks, disinfectant, dry products, liquid soap and flour.
Similarly, out of Australia, on Sunday afternoon it was observed that the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchases of the sanitary paper Andres to two packages of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization declares a pandemic of COVID-19
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared pandemic the outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronation virus.
Although the word "pandemia" refers only to the extent of the spread of a disease, not to how dangerous specific cases are, WHO stressed the need to encourage Governments to take action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, identify and mobilize their inhabitants in response, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of WHO, said.
We are very concerned about both the alarming levels of propaganda and gravity and the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic "has no precedents".
In statements published by CNN in February, he said, "In addition to the influence, no other respiratory virus has been traced from the appearance to the continued worldwide spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, and said "we have never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus before."
"And we have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time," he added.
The new pandemic situation arose following the WHO ' s decision in January to declare outbreak an emergency of public health of international importance.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the outbreak, "in conclusion, it's going to get worse."
Until Thursday, Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, and more than 4,600 deaths.
Coronavirus pandemic 2019–20 is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and declared an international public health emergency on 30 January 2020 and was recognised as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, and around 97,000 deaths as a result.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The death rate per case was estimated to be 4 per cent in China, while worldwide it ranges from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and lack of air.
Complications may include acute respiratory distress pneumonia and syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic therapy and support. The recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping away from other people and controlling and self-inflictioning of people suspected of being infected.
The authorities around the world responded through the implementation of travel restrictions, quarantine, dropouts, workplace hazard controls and plant closures.
The pandemic caused a serious global socio-economic change, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and the widespread lack of supplies exacerbated by panic-driven purchases.
Schools and universities closed at national or local level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world ' s student population.
Wrong information on the virus was disseminated via the Internet, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of East and South-East Asian descent and appearance, and other areas with significant virus cases.
Due to the reduction of heavy industry travel and closures, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities in Wuhan, China, (the capital of the province of Hubei) reported a group of cases of unknown cause pneumonia, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
The cases, in most cases, were related to the majorist marine market in Huaan, so it was thought that the virus had a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to the coronaviruses, pangoline and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first person suspected of symptoms became sick on December 1, 2019, and that person had no visible connections with the last group of the wet market.
In the first group of cases reported in December 2019, it was established that two thirds had a link to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that a 55-year-old person in Hubei Province could have been the first in a case that was raised on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases, according to reports, decreased in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had for the first time exceeded the number of new cases within China.
There may be a considerable number of cases not reported, especially among those with milder symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported in young people, and 19-year-olds and underage individuals accounted for 2.4 per cent of cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance, the main scientific adviser to the United Kingdom, believed that 60 per cent of the British population would have to be infected before effective collective immunity could be achieved.
Cases refer to the number of persons who submitted to COVID-19 tests and who obtained a positive result confirmed in accordance with official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had carried out tests in more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries had official policies to refrain from carrying out tests in persons with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, in China, up to 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection of 79% of cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not, the time spent from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, being the most frequent 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, on 5 February, approximately 80 per cent of deaths were for persons over 60 years of age, and 75 per cent had pre-existing diseases, including cardiovascular and diabetes diseases. Official death records for the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to the deceased persons who gave positive results in the COVID test, according to official protocols.
The number of real deaths caused by COVID-19 may be much higher, since it may not include people who died without evidence, for example, in their homes, in homes of elders, etc.
Partial data from Italy revealed that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official record of deaths by COVID in a factor of 4 to 5 times.
A spokesperson from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted "We know that [the number of reported deaths] is a underestimation," a statement confirmed by anecdotal subcontent reports in the United States. This underestimation is frequent in pandemics, as in the H1N1 swine flu pandemic of 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside continental China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in each of the countries of Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, in all continents except Antarctica, using a number of indicators to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary according to the region and over time, and are influenced by the amount of evidence, the quality of the health system, the treatment options, the time spent from the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The proportion of deaths over cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time period.
According to statistics at Johns Hopkins University, the global proportion of deaths in cases is 6.0 per cent (97 039/1 617 204) to 10 April 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, the proportion of deaths in cases decreased from 17.3% (in those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (in those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other indicators include the mortality rate per case, reflecting the percentage of people diagnosed who died because of a disease, and the mortality rate per infection, reflecting the percentage of infected (diagnised and not diagnosed) who died because of a disease.
These statistics do not have a specific deadline and consider a specific population from infection to the resolution of the case.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the mortality rate for pandemic infections as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this grade is consistent with the results of the first random tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on the estimates of the mortality rate per case.
WHO states that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and the final length of the burst are uncertain and may vary according to location.
Maciej Boni of the State University of Pennsylvania said, "Infectious outbreaks, if they are not controlled, usually stabilize and then begin to decrease when the disease is gone.
But, at this moment, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction of when that will happen."
The Government of China's chief medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, argued that "could end in June" if all countries could be mobilized to follow the WHO recommendation on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski, of the School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine of London, said that SARS-CoV-2 "will remain circulating, possibly for one or two years".
According to the study of Imperial College conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus, since it is transmitted so easily, disappears completely" and "may become a seasonal disease, which appears every year."
The virulence of reappearance would depend on the collective immunity and the magnitude of the mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and infected persons may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dryness (68%).
The less common symptoms include fatigue, spout production in the respiratory tract (flema), loss of smell sense, lack of air, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptissis, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO states that approximately one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, chest pressure or persistent pain, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up and blueness in the face or lips; immediate medical attention is recommended in the presence of these symptoms. The greatest advance of the disease may cause severe pneumonia, acute respiratory difficulty syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected individuals may be asymptomatic, not presenting clinical symptoms, although the results of the test confirm the infection, therefore the investigators advised to monitor and carefully examine those who have close contact with confirmed infected persons in order to dispose of the infection.
Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic individuals range from about 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is more often 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell at first was 30% and then decreased to 15%.
Some details of how the disease is spread are still being determined.
It is believed that the disease is spread mainly during the close contact and through the small drops that occur at the cough, shock or talk; the close contact is considered to be 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to the studies, when the cough is not covered, the droplets can be moved from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops that remain in the air for longer periods, which can be generated by speaking. Respiratory drops can also occur during exhalation, even when speaking, although the virus is generally not transmitted by air.
The droplets can enter the mouth or nose of people who are close or possibly inhale into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary reactivation (RCP), can cause the aerosolization of respiratory secretions and therefore air propagation.
It can also be spread when one touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose or mouth.
While there is concern that the facts can be transmitted, it is believed that this risk is low.
The Government of China denied the possibility of oral fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of the symptoms, although the spread may be possible before the symptoms and at the most advanced stages of the disease are detected.
People obtained positive results in the disease trials up to three days prior to the onset of the symptoms, indicating that transmission is possible before significant symptoms develop.
There are only a few reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed by the laboratory, but some countries have identified asymptomatic transmission during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) maintains that, although it is not fully clear the ease with which the disease is spread, usually one person is infected with two or three other people. The virus survives from hours to days on the surface.
Specifically, the virus was detected for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, one day in cardboard and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Positive results were obtained in COVID-19 tests performed in pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although the British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other surfaces that could have affected infected persons.
The coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with the acute respiratory disease group in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the coronation viruses related to nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies when in contact with soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It's believed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analyses revealed that the coronavirus is genetically grouped with the betacoronavirus genus, its subgenus sarbecovirus (line B) together with two strains derived from the murceliac.
At the level of the complete genome, 96 % is identical to other samples of mulciélag coronation virus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the sequences of the genome between the pangoline viruses and those of the human beings.
To date, the comparison of the complete genome indicated that the pangoline coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 share at most 92% of the genetic material, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that the pangoline is the intermediate guest.
The virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although ultimately confirmed through the polymerase chain reaction with inverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by computerized tomography images.
According to a study in Wuhan comparing polymerase chain reaction to computerized tomography, computerized tomography is much more sensitive than polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images match the processes of other diseases and pneumonia.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not to use computerized tomography as a detection method or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19".
WHO has published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses the polymerase chain reaction with inverse transcriptase in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed in samples of blood or breathing.
Results are generally available within a few hours or days.
Usually this test is performed with a nasopharynx hyop, although it can also be used for the neck. Some laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have shown to be sufficiently accurate to approve their generalised use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
The characteristic features in the images of radiographs and computerized tomographs (TC) of symptomatic individuals include opaque asymmetric peripheral glass and missing pleural discharges.
The Italian Society of Radiology is compiling an online international database of results obtained in confirmed case images.
Due to overposition with other infections such as adenovirus, the diagnosis of unconfirmed images by polymerase chain reaction has a limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A comprehensive study conducted in China compared the results of chest Computed Tomography with that of polymerase chain reaction and showed that, although the diagnosis for images is less specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a detection tool in the areas affected by the epidemic.
Convolutional neuronal networks based on artificial intelligence were developed to detect the characteristics of the virus in images, with both radiographics and computerized tomography.
Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include keeping a good general personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with your hands without washing them before, and amazed or coughing on a disposable panel and throwing the panel directly into a waste container.
It is recommended that those who may already be infected use a surgical mask in public.
Physical distance measures are also recommended to prevent transmission; many Governments have restricted or disassociated all non-essential travel from and to countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community spread in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community do not know where or how it was infected. It is recommended that health care providers who attack someone who may be infected take standard precautions, contact precautions and use eye protection. Tracking contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the origin of an infection and to prevent more transmission.
The use of data on the location of mobile phones by Governments for this purpose has generated concerns about privacy, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement demanding limits on such monitoring.
Several mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on respectful privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record the proximity of a user to other mobile phones.
The users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who gave a positive answer to the COVID-19 test. They are circling wrong ideas about how to prevent infection; for example, nasal wash and mouthwashing are not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the bathroom or when they have clearly dirty hands; before eating and after ringing the nose, coughing or shaking.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus dies when in contact with soap, which detachs its protective bubble.
CDCs also recommended the use of an alcohol-based hand disinfectant with at least 60 % of alcohol in volume when water and soap are not available.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with their hands without washing them before.
The surfaces may be decontaminated with several solutions (within one minute after exposure to the disinfectant in a stainless steel surface), including ethanol at 62–71 %, isopropanol at 50–100 %, sodium hypochlorite at 0,1 %, hydrogen peroxide at 0,5 % and povidone at 0,2–7,5 %.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and gluconate chlorhexidine, are less effective.
CDCs recommend that, if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an installation, such as an office or office, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and automatic cashiers used by sick people are disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a flexed tail or a disposable tot or tot or tot, and that they untie the panel immediately.
It is recommended that those who may be infected use surgical masks, as the use of a mask may limit the volume and distance passed by the respiratory drops that spread when talking, amazed and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "Using a mask can reduce the tendency [of] people to touch the face, which is an important source of infection without proper hand hygiene." The use of masks in people who care for someone who might have the disease has also been recommended.
WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, for example those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that using masks can help people avoid face-to-face.
Several countries have begun to promote the use of masks by the public.
In the U.S., CDCs recommend using non-medical masks made with fabric. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends using a surgical mask to take public transport or be in competing places.
Thailand's health officials recommend that people make screen masks in their homes and wash them daily.
The Czech and Slovak Republic banned public spaces without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam requested that all people use a mask while in public spaces to protect and protect others.
The Austrian Government demanded the use of masks by all persons entering a supermarket.
Israel requested that all residents use masks in public.
Taiwan, which has made 10 million masks a day since mid-March, demanded the use of masks by passengers on interurban trains and buses on April 1.
Panama imposed the mandatory use of masks to get out of the open air, while also recommending the manufacture of masks made at home for those who cannot buy them.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) includes measures to control the infection designed to prevent the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact among people.
The methods include quarantine, travel restrictions and school closures, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centers.
People can implement methods of social distance while staying in their homes, limiting travel, avoiding competing areas, using forms of health that do not include contact and physically distance from other people.
Many governments now demand or recommend social distance in regions affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of the meetings recommended by government agencies and health organizations in the United States was rapidly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known spread of COVID-19 in one region) to 50 people, and then to 10 persons.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems have a higher risk of suffering from serious diseases and complications, and the CDC recommends that they remain in their homes as far as possible in the areas of the community affected by the outbreak. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to replace the term "social distance" by "physical distance", to clarify that the objective is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either virtually or remotely.
The use of the term "social distance" has had the effect of assuming that people should adopt full social isolation rather than encouraging them to keep in touch with other people through alternative means. Some authorities have published guidelines on sexual health to use during the pandemic.
They include recommendations that only have sexual relations with a person with whom he lives, that he does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-infliction was recommended in the home of those diagnosed with COVID-19 and suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions on adequate self-inflation. Many Governments have required or recommended the self-inflation of entire populations in the affected areas.
The most stringent autoquantin instructions were issued for those belonging to high-risk groups.
Persons who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently travelled to a country or region with a generalized transmission are recommended to do self-quantity for 14 days since the last possible exposure.
The strategies for controlling a outbreak are containment or suppression and mitigation.
Containment is carried out in the first stages of the outbreak and is intended to identify and isolate infected persons, in addition to introducing other measures to control infection and vaccines to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts are shifted to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to stop the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of conservation and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
The elimination requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic through the reduction of the basic number of reproduction to less than 1. Part of controlling the outbreak of an infectious disease involves trying to reduce the epidemial peak, which is known as the spread curve of the epidemic.
This reduces the risk of collapse of health services and allows more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, the use of masks and self-quantentine; Community measures aimed at physical distance, such as closing schools and cancelling of events of mass competition; Community commitment to foster acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental measures and cleaning of surfaces. In China, more drastic measures were taken aimed at containing the outbreak once their seriousness had been evident, for example, the implementation of quarantine in whole cities and the imposition of strict travel bans.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea carried out massive detection and quarantine assessments, and issued alerts on the movements of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial support to infected persons who decided to quarantine and imposed great fines on those who did not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and has sanctioned the accumulation of medical supplies. Simulations in Britain and the United States show that mitigation (which reduces the spread of the epidemic but does not stop it) and suppression (which reverses the growth of the pandemic) have major challenges.
Optimum mitigation policies could reduce the maximum demand for medical care in two thirds and death to half, but still generate hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
The elimination may be preferred, but it must be maintained throughout the time the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if that happens first), because the transmission reacts rapidly when the measures are flexible.
Long-term intervention to eliminate the pandemic entails social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral medicines approved for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing medicines.
Taking free selling medicines for the cold, drink liquids and rest can help relieve the symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory assistance may be required.
The use of steroids can make the results worse.
Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also indicated that some "home and traditional medicines" can alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO describes capacity-building and adaptation of medical care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as a fundamental measure of response to outbreak.
The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have formulated guidelines for primary medical care hospitals and services for the redeployment of resources at different levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 tests, canceling optional procedures when possible, separating and isolating patients from positive patients in COVID-19, and increasing intensive care capacities through staff training and increasing the number of breathers and beds available.
There are several theories about where the first case could have originated (the so-called zero patient).
The first case known as the new coronavirus can be resolved as of 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over the course of one month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei increased gradually.
These were mainly linked to the majorist marine market in Huaan, which also sold live animals, and a theory is that the virus comes from one of these animals; or, in other words, that has a zoonotic origin. On 26 December, a number of cases of unknown cause pneumonia were observed by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed Jianghan's CDC of Wuhan on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan's Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "coronavirus similar to SARS".
The police warned eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, about spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was rebuked by his superiors for giving the alarm.
Subsequently, on 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note and informed WHO.
In early January, sufficient cases of unknown cause pneumonia had been reported to health authorities in Wuhan as a starting point for an investigation. During the first stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, contributing to migration for the New Chinese Year and the fact that Wuhan is a transport centre and an important railway crossing.
On 20 January, China reported some 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official data show that, as of 20 January 2020, 6174 people had already developed symptoms. On 26 March, the United States has exceeded China and Italy with the largest number of cases confirmed worldwide. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97 000 people have died and more than 364,000 have been recovered.
Around 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National reactions have included detention measures, such as quarantine (known as housekeeping orders, local or bordering orders) and touch of falling. On 2 April, about 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, perform some kind of bordering in the United States, more than 50 million people are bordered in the Philippines, about 59 million people are bordered in South Africa and 13 billion people are bordered in India.
As of 26 March, 17 billion people around the world had some kind of borderage, which increased to 26 billion people two days later, about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case occurred on 17 November.
On 26 December, Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of cases of unknown cause pneumonia, and his hospital informed Jianghan CDC of Wuhan on 27 December.
The first genetic tests of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
On 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note.
WHO was informed the same day.
While these notifications were being made, the police warned doctors in Wuhan to "broadcast rumors" about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of China initially stated that there was no "clear evidence" of transmission between humans.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a drastic campaign, later described by the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a "popular war", to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the largest quarantine in the history of humanity", on January 23 a health cord was announced that prohibited travel within and outside Wuhan, which extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, and affected a total of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles in the city was prohibited.
The celebrations of the New Chinese Year (January 25th) were canceled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, the Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed within 10 days.
Later, another hospital, the Leishenshan Hospital, was built to receive more patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China also converted 14 other facilities to Wuhan, such as convention and stadium centres, to temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government implemented more measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, which included the issue of health statements for travellers and the extension of the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools were also closed all over the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have implemented a number of measures, especially in relation to schools and universities.
Remote working measures have been established in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions within and outside Hubei were implemented.
Public transport was changed and museums were temporarily closed throughout China.
The control of the public movement was implemented in several cities, and it has been estimated that some 760 million people (over half the population) faced some kind of restriction on outdoor exits. Following the beginning of the global outbreak in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the "importation" of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travellers entering the city. On 23 March, only one case had been transmitted at the national level in the previous five days, on this occasion, through a traveler who returned from Istanbul to Canton.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the dissemination of cases transmitted at the national level was basically blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, the travel restrictions in Hubei, as well as in Wuhan, were flexible two months after the border was imposed. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that visa holders' entry or residence permit would be suspended from 28 March, without specific details of when this policy will end.
Those wishing to enter China should apply for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Government of China urged companies and factories to reopen on 30 March and provided economic stimulus packages for signatures. The State Council declared a day of mourning which will begin with a moment of national silence from three minutes on 4 April at 10:00, coincidenting with the Qingming Festival, although the Central Government asked families to submit their respect for the physical distance in order to avoid the overthrow of the COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, it was confirmed that COVID-19 spread from China to South Korea.
On February 20, the country's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, mainly attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji.
It is suspected that the devotees of Shincheonji who visited Daegu from Wuhan were the source of the outbreak.
On 22 February, of the 9336 church followers, 1261 or about 13% reported symptoms. On 23 February 2020, South Korea declared the highest alert.
More than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea on 28 February, which increased to 3150 on 29 February.
All the military bases in South Korea remained in quarantine after the evidence confirmed that three soldiers had given positive results for the virus.
The airline schedules were also affected, and therefore changed. South Korea presented what was considered the world's widest and best-organized programme to test virus detection in the population and isolate infected persons, as well as identify and quarantine those who were in contact with them.
The methods of detection included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by newly arrived persons from other countries through mobile application, drive-thru centres to perform virus detection tests with results available the next day and increasing diagnostic capacity to be able to test up to 20,000 people every day.
South Korea's programme is considered a success in controlling the outbreak despite not adopting the quarantine in entire cities. South Korea's society was initially polarized with regard to President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed requests to demand the removal of Moon so they considered the Government ' s mismanagement of the outbreak, or rather, to praise its response.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had total cases on a lower day in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that, from 1 April, all newly arrived persons from abroad should remain in quarantine for two weeks.
According to media reports, on 1 April, South Korea received requests for assistance for virus testing in 121 different countries.
On 19 February, Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that same day.
Early measures announced by the Government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events and Friday's prayers, and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran targeted five billion rials to fight the virus.
On 26 February 2020, President Hassan Rouhani said there were no plans to quarantine areas affected by the outbreak, and that only quarantine would be provided to people.
In March plans were announced to limit travel between cities, although heavy traffic between cities as a result of the New Persian Nowraz year continued.
The Shia shrines in Qom remained open to the pilgrims until 16 March 2020. During February, Iran became a virus spread centre after China.
Among the claims of a coverage of the magnitude of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries had traced their cases to Iran by 28 February, indicating that the magnitude of the outbreak could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian Government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament closed, and on 3 March 23 of its 290 members reported that they had obtained positive results in the virus test.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch urged the Iranian penitentiary authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissidenty and also temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
He indicated that there was a greater risk of the spread of the virus in closed institutions, such as detention centres, which also lacked adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths in the same day, the highest recorded number in the country since the outbreak.
On 17 March, at least 12 expolitics or politicians in Iran had died of the disease.
On 23 March, Iran experienced 50 new cases per hour and a new death every ten minutes due to the coronation virus.
According to a WHO official, there may be five times as many cases reported in Iran.
It is also suggested that U.S. sanctions on Iran could be affecting the country's financial capacity to respond to the viral outbreak.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for relief from economic sanctions for the most affected countries, including Iran.
On 31 January, the spread of the outbreak in Italy was confirmed, when two Chinese tourists gave positive results in the SARS-CoV-2 trials in Rome.
Cases began to increase rapidly, leading the Italian Government to suspend all flights from and to China and to declare the state of emergency.
Subsequently, a group of non-related COVID-19 cases was detected, which began with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new law decree to contain the outbreak, which included the quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "You will not be allowed to enter or leave the areas affected by the outbreak.
The suspension of work activities and sporting events in these areas has already been ordered." On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered the complete closure of schools and universities throughout the country while Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sports events, including Series A football matches, were to be held at closed doors until April, but on 9 March, all sports events were fully suspended for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the interruption of almost all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Reimion and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations on medical ethics on the selection protocols that could be used.
On 19 March, Italy surpassed China as the country with the largest number of coronavirus-related deaths worldwide after reporting 3405 deaths by the pandemic.

As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recoveries in Italy, most of which occurred in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of Italy from a large elderly population and the inability to test all persons with the virus to date could contribute to the high mortality rate.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus first emerged as one of the most relaxed affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British Government did not impose any kind of social distance or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the Government received criticism of the apparent lack of speed and intensity in its response to public concerns. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement in which he rejected social contact and all non-essential trips, and suggested that people work from their homes whenever possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the Government announced the closure as soon as possible of all leisure facilities, such as bars and gymnasiums, and promised to pay up to 80 per cent of employees' salaries to a limit of GBP 2500 per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced more stringent social distance measures, which prohibited meetings of more than two persons and restricted travel and outdoor activities to those considered strictly necessary.
Unlike previous measures, the police could require compliance with these restrictions through the imposition of fines and the dispersal of meetings.
The closure of most companies was ordered, with the exception of those considered "essentials", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, ferreteries, gas stations and workshops.

Despite doing so, the United States had a slow beginning in carrying out tests, which concealed the true magnitude of the outbreak at that time.
Tests were carried out by defective test kits produced by the federal government in February, the lack of approval by the federal government of non-governmental test kits (from academies, companies and hospitals) until the end of February and the restrictive criteria to qualify for a test until the beginning of March (after which a medical order was required).

The general approval of the management of the Trump crisis has been polarized among the party lines.
Some U.S. officials and commentators criticized the dependence of the U.S. on the import of critical materials, including special medical supplies, from China.
An analysis of the travel patterns was used to identify and predict the patterns of dissemination and was published in The Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.
Based on the 2018 information provided by the International Air Transport Association, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei, the largest number of passengers from Wuhan.
Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also reported as popular destinations for people travelling from Wuhan.

China's assistance, on the other hand, was widely accepted in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank initiated emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to control and maintain the epidemic.
WHO pointed out the difference between the outbreak of SARS 2002-2004, when it was accused of the Chinese authorities of secretism that prevented prevention and detention efforts, and the current crisis, in which the central government has "provided periodic updates to avoid panic in front of the holidays of the New Moon Year".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement a ban on transport in Wuhan, the representative of WHO Gauden Galea noted that, although "it was definitely not a recommendation made by WHO", it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it was concentrated" and said that "it had no precedent in public health history". On 30 January, after confirmation of the transmission between humans outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak of an emergency of public health of international importance (ESPII), the sixth SPII since the first call for action during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom said that ESPII was "at risk of global spread, especially for low- and medium-income countries without sound health systems".
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take measures that are unnecessary interference in international trade and travel" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade or movement".
On 5 February, WHO used the world community for a $675 million contribution to finance strategic preparation in low-income countries, and cited the urgency to support those countries that "did not have systems to detect persons who contracted the virus, if any".
He also made statements in which he stated that "we are only as strong as our weakest slave" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more in the future". On 11 February, WHO announced at a press conference that COVID-19 was the name of the disease.
On the same day, Theodores stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, had agreed to contribute the “power of the entire United Nations system in response”.
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team was activated, which allowed coordination of the response of all the United Nations, which, according to WHO, would enable them to “focus on the health response while other agencies can provide their expertise to address the social, economic and development implications of the outbreak”.
On 14 February, a joint mission team led by WHO with China was set up to provide international experts and WHO on the ground in China to assist in national management and to assess "the severity and transmissibility of the disease" through the organization of workshops and meetings with major national institutions and to make on-the-spot visits to assess the "impact of response activities at provincial and county level, including urban and rural environments". On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world must do more to prepare for a possible coronary pandemic", and noted that, although it was still very ready to call it a pandemic, countries should nevertheless be "at a preparatory stage".
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team to assess the situation there. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the global threat assessment for coronavirus would be raised from "very high" to "very high", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergency Programme, warned in a statement that "This is a verification of reality for all governments on the planet: wake up.
This virus can be on the way and we must be prepared," insisting that appropriate response measures could help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan also said that the current data did not guarantee that public health officials declared a global pandemic, and noted that that statement would mean that "we are basically accepting that all human beings on the planet will be exposed to that virus".
On March 11, the WHO declared pandemic the outbreak of coronavirus.
The Director-General said that WHO was "very concerned, both with alarming levels of spread and severity and with alarming levels of inaction". WHO has received important criticism as to how to treat the pandemic, including the late statement of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The negative response included the request for the resignation of WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, signed by 733,000 people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of all persons during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group of experts indicated that everyone has the right to save lives and that the Government has this responsibility.
The group noted that the lack of resources or medical insurance should never be used as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
Experts noted that all persons have the right to health, including persons with disabilities, those belonging to minority groups, older persons, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, those living in extreme poverty, detained persons, as well as refugees and other non-specified groups that need government support.
International government organizations are addressing the social and economic impact of the crisis by COVID-19.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information on political responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy to addressing the effects of bordering and travel restrictions, the digital centre includes a country-by-country policy tracker, and aims to help countries learn from one another and to facilitate a global coordinated response to the challenge of the coronary virus.
The Government of China has been criticized by the United States, the Minister of the Office of the United Kingdom, Michael Gove, and the son of the president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for his management of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several managers were fired at the provincial level of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC) because of their management of quarantine efforts in Central China, a sign of discontent with the response of the political system to outbreaks in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this measure was taken to protect the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, from the public wrath of the outbreak of the coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, for example, Zhao Lijian, rejected an earlier recognition of the beginning of the outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 in the United States or Italy.
The administration of Donald Trump of the U.S. has referred to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or the "Wuhan virus", and stated that "China censorship has over-enhanced a virus that has now become a global pandemic," which in turn was pointed out by some critics as racism and "distraction" of the failure of their administration to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast obtained a telegram from the U.S. Government that described a communication strategy with apparent origin in the National Security Council, and cited the strategy as "Everything about China".
We have been told that we are trying to deliver this message in any way possible, including press conferences and television shows. "Media such as Politicians, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China's efforts to send assistance to countries affected by the virus are part of a campaign to gain global influence.
The European Union's foreign policy representative, Josep Borrell, warned that "there is a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through propaganda and generosity policy".
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner".
China also requested that the United States raise its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while reportedly sent assistance to these two countries.
On 3 April, United States sanctions blocked Jack Ma ' s donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba.
The United States authorities were also accused of diverting aid from other countries to their own country.
And disputes concerning masks have been reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and between the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of breathers destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government criticised the lack of solidarity between the European Union and Italy, affected by the crown virus.
Maurizio Massari, Italian ambassador to the European Union, said "Only China responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfectants and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" who claimed that 80% of Russia's aid was "useless or of little use for Italy".
The source accused Russia of committing an offensive of "geopolitical and diplomatic seduction".
The president of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Mayo rejected the journalistic reports and expressed their appreciation.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that "by offering assistance to US colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when US manufacturers of medical materials and equipment provide impetus, they may also respond if necessary".
NATO's planned military exercise "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, NATO's largest war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be carried out on a reduced scale.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticised the Defence 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, it endangers not only the lives of the United States troops and the various European countries involved, but also those of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate." The Iranian Government was very affected by the virus, with about two dozen members of the infected Parliament, as well as fifteen other current and previous political figures.
On 14 March 2020, Iran's President, Hassan Rouhani, wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help, and said that his country is having difficulty fighting the outbreak due to the lack of access to international markets as a result of United States sanctions against Iran. The outbreak prompted the requirement that the United States adopt common social policies in other rich countries, such as universal health care, universal child care, paid family license and higher levels of public health funds.
Political analysts predicted that it could negatively affect Donald Trump's re-election possibilities in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticised Japan's "expert and passive quarantine efforts", after Japan announced that any person from South Korea would remain in quarantine for two weeks on sites designated by the Government.
South Korean society was initially polarized with regard to Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed requests to demand the removal of Moon so they considered the Government's mismanagement of the outbreak, or rather, to praise its response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it might allow Governments to strengthen their control of power.
In Hungary, his Parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend Parliament and the elections, and punish those who are deemed to have spread false information about the virus and the management of the crisis by the Government.
It was responsible for the outbreak of coronavirus in several cases of supply shortage, as a result of the increased use at the global level of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases and disruptions of logistics and factory operations.
The Food and Drug Administration of the United States has issued warnings about the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to the increased demand of consumers and the disruption of suppliers.
Several localities also witnessed panic-driven purchases that left empty containers of essential products, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, causing lack of supplies.
The technology sector, in particular, has been warning about delays in electronic product shipments.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protection equipment increased 100 times.
This demand generated an increase in prices of up to 20 times the normal price and also caused delays of four to six months in the supply of medical articles.
It also caused a shortage of personal protection equipment worldwide, and WHO warned that this would put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of formula for babies in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian Government. Despite the high prevalence of cases of COVID-19 in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent demand for food, none of these areas were affected by the acute food shortage.
China and Italy's measures against the accumulation and illicit trade in essential products have been successful, and they have prevented a sharp shortage of food that was anticipated in Europe and North America.
The North of Italy, with its important agricultural production, has not had a significant reduction, but prices could increase, according to industry representatives.
Food supplies were temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pig meat reserves to ensure sufficient food for the population.
In Italy there are similar laws requiring food producers to maintain reserves for these emergencies.
The damage to the world economy was felt in China: according to a periodic report of 16 March, China's economy was very affected in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the Government to stop the spread of the virus, and retail sales dropped by 20.5%.
Since continental China is an important economic and manufacturing centre, the viral outbreak has been considered a threat of significant destabilization for the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist's Intelligence Unit has predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture of the potential consequences emerges.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic consequences of the global growth epidemic could exceed those of the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate by an expert at the University of Washington in San Luis indicated an impact of over $300 billion in the world's supply chains that could last up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of Oil Exporting Countries (OPEC) remained "revolving" after a strong drop in oil prices due to China's lower demand.
On 24 February, world value markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside continental China.
On 27 February, due to increasing concerns about the outbreak of coronavirus, several US stock exchanges, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, published their most pronounced drop since 2008, Dow dropped 1191 points, the biggest drop in one day since the 2007–08 financial crisis.
The three indices ended the week with a decrease of more than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative perspective.
The actions fell again on the basis of fears of the coronavirus, the biggest fall occurred on 16 March.
Many believe that there is likely an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of the states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they did to the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, the closure of public places including travel attractions and the recommendation of Governments not to travel anywhere in the world.
As a result, numerous airlines have cancelled flights due to the lesser demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe crashed.
The impact on the sector of cruise companies reached a level never before seen.
Several railway stations and transshipment terminals have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, an important travel season related to the New Chinese Year's holidays.
Several events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including New Year's festivals, while private companies also independently closed their tourist shops and attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many events and tourist attractions of the New Year Lunar have been closed to avoid mass concentrations, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year's holiday until 10 February, and ordered most of the workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80 % of GDP and 90 % of the country's exports.
Hong Kong raised its level of response to the highest infectious disease and declared an emergency, closed schools until March, and cancelled its New Year celebrations. The minority sector was affected at the world level, with reductions in hours of attention or temporary closures.
Minority visits to Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Minorists in North America and the Middle East experienced a 50 to 60 per cent decline.
This also caused a 33% to 43% fall in pedestrian traffic to shopping centers in March compared to February.
Operators of shopping centres around the world have imposed additional measures, such as greater hygiene, the installation of thermal scanners to control the temperature of buyers and the cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession induced by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in an extreme poverty situation in Latin America than those who had remained in that situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the highest point of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's nearly 300 million migrant rural workers were displaced in their homes in the provinces of the interior or trapped in the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and requested government assistance.
The outbreak of coronavirus could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates from the Bank of the Federal Reserve of San Luis. The bordering in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (receiving daily wages) unemployed. According to the Angus Reid Institute survey, 44% of Canadian households experienced some kind of unemployment. Around 900,000 workers lost their jobs in Spain since the bordering began in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit plan. Nearly half a million companies in Germany have implemented short-term work schemes subsidized by the Government, known as Kurzwerk, for their workers.
The German short-term compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Great Britain.
The sectors of scenic art and cultural heritage were deeply affected by the pandemic, which had an impact on the operations of organizations and on people, both employed and independent, worldwide.
Culture and arts organizations have tried to carry out their mission (often funded with public funds) to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, to maintain the safety of its employees and the public and to support artists whenever possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, theatres and other cultural institutions had been permanently closed around the world, and their exhibitions, events and shows had been cancelled or postponed.
In response, great efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent consequence that increases to an accelerated rate of disease is the abolition of religious services. Important sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered interruptions. The Vatican announced the cancellation of the celebrations of the Holy Week in Rome, which took place during the last week of the Christian penitentiary season of the Quaresma.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay in their homes instead of participating in the church on Sundays; some churches offered religious services through radio, live radio or television, while others offer spaces to pray from the car.
After the decision of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome to close its churches and chapels and with the empty Square of St. Peter of Christian pilgrims, other religious agencies also cancelled their services and limited the public concentration in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and guerdwaras.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Friday's plegiaries in the areas affected by the outbreak and then the sanctuaries were closed, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreign pilgrims and their residents to the holy places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant change in the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most of the major sports events were cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA 2019-20 Championships League, the Prime League 2019-20, the UEFA Euro 2020, the NBA 2019-20 and the NHL 2019-20.
The outbreak interrupted the plans of the 2020 Olympic Games, which were originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event "will be reprogrammed for a later date but not after the summer of 2021". Casinos and other places of play around the world closed and online poker tournaments were delayed or cancelled.
This caused many gamblers to use the Internet, many online betting sites reported significant increases in their new subscription rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, several musical groups suspended or cancelled concerts.
Many big theaters, such as Broadway's, also suspended all the shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing their work through the Internet as an alternative to the traditional live show, such as live concerts broadcasts or the creation of "festivals" on the Internet for artists to interpret, distribute or publish their work.
On-line, numerous Internet memes have been disseminated on the coronavirus, as many resort to humor and distraction in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and towards people of Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
February reports (when most cases were still limited to China) have documented racist feelings in various groups around the world expressing that the Chinese deserved the virus or were receiving what they considered to be just retribution.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in antiquities.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
The Chinese and those in the areas affected by the virus have received support, both on the Internet and outside of the virus.
Following the advance of the outbreak to new countries where the situation is critical, the people of Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be subject to suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to obtain a ban on Chinese entry to their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was a trend on Twitter.
The Chinese, in addition to other Asian people in the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported higher levels of racist insults, as well as attacks.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, was criticized for referring to the coronation virus as the "China virus", a term that many critics considered racist and anti-Chin.
Showcases in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign evacuations from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
According to reports, students from northeastern India, who share a border with China, and who study in the main Indian cities, suffered harassment in relation to the outbreak of coronavirus.
The president of the state unit of Bharatiya Janata party in Western Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, expressed that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God came from them".
China's consulate in Calcutta then condemned the comments and said they were "errones". In China, they increased xenophobia and racism towards non-Chinese residents as a result of the pandemic, and it was described to foreigners as "foreign trash" and intended for the "waste".
Many newspapers with pay walls removed them for parts or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific editors published scientific articles related to the open access outbreak.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for coronary respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of virus in the samples is confirmed through the polymerase chain reaction test with inverse transcriptase, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and monitoring of the population.
Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who had too mild symptoms as to inform them or were asymptomatic.
Based on the results of this test, a precise mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity in the population can be determined.
Due to limited evidence, until March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were large variations in the number of tests carried out in different countries.
This variability is also likely to have a significant impact on the reported mortality rates, which are probably very overestimated in some countries.
Through the chain reaction of polymerase with inverse transcriptase in real time (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed in respiratory samples obtained through several methods, including nasopharyngeal hyopas or spout samples.
The results are generally available within a few hours up to 2 days.
The polymerase chain reaction test with inverse transcriptase performed with pharyngitis is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Subsequently, the virus can disappear in the throat, but it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In the infected persons who are tested during the second week, as an alternative, the sample material may be obtained from the deep parts of the respiratory pathways by means of a suction catheter, or the material expelled from the cough (exposure) may be used.
One of the first evidence of polymerase chain reaction was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using the polymerase chain reaction with inverse transcriptase in real time (rRT-PCR), and formed the basis of the 250 000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
As of 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed a test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the clinical grade polymerase chain reaction (PowerCheck Coronavirus).
Search for the gene "E" shared by all the betacoronavirus and the specific RdRp gene of SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain the emergency approval of the National Administration of Chinese Medical Products of a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on polymerase chain reaction. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are distributing their polymerase chain response diagnostic panel with inverse transcriptase in real time for the new coronary 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International reagent resource.
One of three genetic tests in the previous versions of the test kits generated inconclusive results due to defective reagents, and a fixture in performing tests in the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average, less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
The reliability of the two-component tests was not determined until 28 February 2020, and only from that time did the state and local laboratories be allowed to carry out tests.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under an emergency use authorisation. The commercial laboratories of the United States began to test in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability at the national level of the COVID-19 evidence based on the polymerase inverse transcriptase chain reaction.
Similarly, as of 9 March 2020, Quest Diagnostics provided evidence for COVID-19 at the national level.
No limits on quantity were announced; collection of specimens and processing should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDCs.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Centre for Virology Research and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Medical Care Monitoring Service. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect the infection by COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could take place within 3.5 hours in large volume, allowing a machine to perform approximately 4128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued the Emergency Use Authorisation for Abbott Laboratories for a test in the Abbott m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorisations for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid received the same authorisation for emergency use of the FDA for a test that takes approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test using the isothermal amplifying technology of nuclear acids instead of the polymerase chain reaction.
Since this does not require a series of alternate cycles of temperature, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott plans to increase production to perform 50,000 tests per day. In Taiwan, a test is being developed that uses a monoclonal antibody that is specifically linked to the nucleocapid protein (protein N) of the new coronary virus, with the hope that it can provide results within a period of 15 to 20 minutes as a rapid test for influenza.
In March 2020, the publication review concluded that "thorax radiographics have little diagnostic value in the first stages, while the results of the TC [computerized tomography] can be obtained even before symptoms occur".
Typical features in the TC include bilateral multilobular opacitys in exposed glass with a peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, there is a subpleural domain, a pattern of impedation and consolidation.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, where the polymerase chain reaction was compared to the computerized tomography, the computerized tomography is much more sensitive than the polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonia.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not to use computerized tomography as a detection method or as a first line test to diagnose COVID-19". Since March 2020, CDCs have recommended the polymerase chain reaction as an initial review.
Part of the immune system's reaction to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in people about 7 days after symptoms, to determine immunity and to monitor the population. Analysis can be carried out in central laboratories or through evidence at the point of attention.
Automated high-performance systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For central laboratory analyses, only one specimen of peripheral blood is usually used, although serious specimens can be used to follow the immune response.
For tests at the point of attention, a single specimen of blood is usually obtained by a puncture in the skin.
Unlike the polymerase chain reaction methods, there is no need for an extraction step before analysis. On 26 March 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that provided notification to the agency as appropriate and therefore can now distribute their antibody tests.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received Europe's approval for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The test capacity is several hundred samples over time and is therefore much faster than the conventional viral RNA polymerase chain reaction test.
In early April, the United Kingdom discovered that none of the antibody test kits it bought were good enough to use.
Hong Kong has created a program in which suspected patients can stay in their homes, "the emergency department gives the patient a sample tube", the patient spits on the tube, sends it and gets a result in a short time. British NHS announced that it is implementing a pilot program to analyze the suspected cases in their homes, which eliminates the risk that the patient infects others if they go to the hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if one is used. In tests at drive-through centres for the COVID-19 of suspected cases, a health professional takes samples with appropriate precautions.
The drive-through centres have helped South Korea make some of the fastest and most extensive tests in any country. In Germany, the National Association of Health Insurance Doctors Statutory said on 2 March that it had a capacity for approximately 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient environment and that 10 700 people had been tested last week.
Health insurance assumes costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a general capacity to perform 160,000 tests per week.
As of 19 March, evidence was offered through the drive-through system in several large cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first survey of laboratories revealed that, in the natural week of 12/2020, at least 483,295 samples had been analysed, up to and including the week of 12/2020, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) had produced positive results for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Institute of Technology and the Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method to analyze samples of 64 patients simultaneously, which consists of grouping samples and only to do more analysis if the combined sample is positive. On 5 February 2020, in Wuhan, the BGI opened a 2000-square-meter emergency detection laboratory called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese, or "Fire Eye") which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
With the construction, which was supervised by the Founder of BGI, Wang Jian, and which took 5 days, the model showed that cases in Hubei had been 47% higher and that the corresponding cost of dealing with quarantine had been doubled without this capacity for testing.
After Wuhan's laboratory, Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately built in Shenzhen, Tianjín, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
As of 4 March 2020, total daily production was 50 000 tests per day. Multiple open source designs provided by origami analysis were implemented that allow to evaluate up to 1122 samples of patients for COVID19 using only 93 analyses. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need to use liquid handling robots.
By March, the shortage and insufficient levels of reactors had affected massive evidence in the European Union and the United States.
This led some authors to explore sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that United Arab Emirates was now doing more tests on the detection of coronavirus per person in its population than in any other country, and was aimed at increasing the level of testing to cover most of the population.
This was achieved through the combination of drive-through capacity and the purchase of a mass production laboratory at the level of the population of Group 42 and BGI (based on their emergency detection laboratories "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory has the capacity to perform tens of thousands of polymerase chain reaction tests with inverse transcriptase per day and is the first in the world of this magnitude that works outside China.
Different test formulas were developed that address different parts of the genetic profile of the coronary virus in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula for making kits that it sent to low-income countries with no resources to develop its own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until 28 January, which delayed the evidence available in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the demands and recommendations of health experts on tests.
On the contrary, experts say that the high availability of tests in South Korea has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The Government of South Korea has achieved its capacity to carry out tests, mainly in private sector laboratories, over several years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization requested increased testing programmes as the best way to reduce the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus caused delays in hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and the supply of hyopates and chemical reagents was exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDCs had "defects"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private testing. Spain bought test kits for the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but obtained inaccurate results.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be due to incorrect sampling or incorrect use of the kits.
The Ministry of Spain said that it would remove the missing kits and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic bought to China gave incorrect results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million kits to China that turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they be thrown into the Danube. Ateş Kara, from the Turkish Ministry of Health, said that the test kits Turkey bought to China had a "high error rate" and did not "use them". The United Kingdom bought 3.5 million test kits to China, but, in early April 2020, announced that they were not serving.
Evidence, complemented by the quarantine of those who had obtained positive results and the identification of those with whom they had contacted who had given positive results in SARS-CoV-2, resulted in satisfactory results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vó, the place where the first death occurred by COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two rounds of tests in the entire population of about 3400 inhabitants, with about ten days of difference.
About half of those who had achieved positive results had no symptoms, and all cases detected were quarantined.
With the restriction of travel in the municipality, this completely eliminated the new infections.
With the intensive tracking of contacts, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantine, the crown virus 2020 pandemic in Singapore progressed much slower than in other developed countries, but did not apply extreme restrictions, such as forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and on March 28, Singapore began to recommend to residents who remain in their homes, but schools opened again in time after the 23 March holiday.
Other countries have also controlled the pandemic with the intensive tracking of contacts, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantine, but with less stringent borders, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have carried out more evidence, in relation to the number of deaths, have much lower mortality rates, probably because these countries have more capacity to detect people who have only mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the capacity to carry out tests and that have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and their first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories to perform confirmatory tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 are in Europe, 2 are in Africa, 1 are in North America, and 1 are in Australia.
In the following table, the "positive as % of evidence" column is influenced by the country's testing policy.
A country that only carries out tests in people entering hospitals will have a higher number of positives than % of evidence that a country that carries out tests in all citizens, whether they are symptoms or not, is the same.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the action of washing hands with a view to eliminating dirt, fat, microorganisms or other undesirable substances.
The continuous washing of hands with soap in certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted by fecal-oral means.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or common cold, for example, if their hands are not washed before touching the eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five critical moments during the day in which it is important to wash hands with soap include: before and after the defection, after cleaning a child's tail or changing clothes, before feeding a child, before and before and after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
If there is no water or soap available, hands can be cleaned with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during and after preparing meals.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing clothes or cleaning up a kid who used the bathroom.
After the nose is ringing, coughing or admiring.
After touching animals, feed for animals or animal waste.
Hand medical hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before administering medicines or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacterials, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause a disease) and chemicals that may cause damage or diseases.
This is particularly important for people who manipulate food or who work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many benefits for health, including minimising the spread of influenza, coronation and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the infant mortality rate in births at home.
A 2013 study showed that improvements in hand washing practices can generate small improvements in height growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple changes in behaviour, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action may reduce the mortality rate by almost 50% for these diseases.
Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhoea episodes in about a third, and this is similar to providing drinking water in low-income areas.
48% of the decreases in diarrhoea episodes can be related to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the most effective and economic way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections, such as automatic behavior in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, a major acute respiratory disease, is the main cause of mortality in children under five years of age, and is charged for the lives of an estimated amount of 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhoea and combined pneumonia represent nearly 3.5 million child deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, converting soap-washing hands before eating and after using the bath as a root habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, which would reduce almost half of the deaths by diarrhoea and one quarter of the deaths by acute respiratory infections.
Hand washing is generally integrated with other health interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of hand washing is that its frequent realization can cause skin damage due to skin resuscitation.
According to a Danish study carried out in 2012, excessive hand washing can cause a skin condition that causes itching and makes the skin camouflage known as hand enamel or dermatitis of the hands, which is especially common in health workers.
Excessive hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
There are five critical moments during the day in which hand washing with soap is important to reduce the oral-fee transmission of diseases: after using the bathroom (orientate, defecate), after cleaning a child's tail (change clothes), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
Other occasions in which proper hand washing techniques must be practiced to prevent transmission of diseases include before and after treatment of a cut or wound; after shaking, coughing or ringing the nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching trash.
In many countries, there is a low rate of hand washing with soap.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries conducted in 2015 concluded that on average 38.7% of families practiced hands washing with soap. A study conducted in 2014 indicated that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97%; the United States was close to half with 77%; and China had the lowest rate of 23%. Currently, there are several methodologies for changing behaviors, to increase the custom of washing hands with soap at critical times. Hand washing in groups of children at school at certain times of the day is an option in developing countries to incorporate hand washing in the behavior of children.
The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education of the Philippines is an example of action to promote children ' s health and education.
Disappearing twice a year, in addition to washing hands with soap every day, brushing your teeth daily with fluoride, are the basis of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The elimination of skin microorganisms improves by adding soaps or detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is ineffective to clean the skin because the fats and proteins, which are components of the organic matter, are not easily dissolved in the water.
However, a reasonable flow of water facilitates cleaning.
The solid soap, due to its reusable nature, can contain bacteria acquired in previous uses.
Some studies that analyzed the transfer of contaminated solid soap bacteria concluded that the transfer is unlikely, as bacteria are treated with foam.
Even so, the CDCs say "it is preferable to liquid soap with exemption controls that do not involve the use of hands".
Antibacterial soaps have been strongly promoted to a conscious public of health.
Currently, there is no evidence that the use of recommended disinfectants or antiseptics preserves organisms resistant to antibiotics by nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which have an extensive list of strains of resistant organisms.
Thus, although antibacterial soaps do not preserve the strains resistant to antibiotics, they may not be as effective as they are promoted.
In addition to the surfactant agent that protects the skin, sophisticated formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as well as pH regulator, benzoic acid with antimicrobial activity and more skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, mentol, plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon’s School of Public Health indicated that common soaps are as effective as the antibacterial soaps for the consumer that contain triclosan to prevent diseases and eliminate hand bacteria.
The pleasant hot water to wash your hands is not enough to remove bacteria.
The bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, jabonous tibia water is more effective than cold jabonous water to eliminate natural oils that retain soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using tibia water has no effect on reducing microbial load in the hands.
A hand disinfectant or hand antiseptic is a waterless agent for hand hygiene.
At the end of 1990 and in the first part of the twenty-first century, the agents for the hygiene of hands without water and alcohol to float (also known as hand-based alcohol solution to float, antiseptic hand solution to float or hand disinfectants) began to acquire popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) in a gel, or a moisturizer as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for easy use and to reduce the effect of alcohol rehydration.
Adding dilute hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing between 60 and 95 % alcohol at least effectively eliminate germs.
Alcohol-based fungal disinfectants eliminate bacteria, drug-resistant bacteria (SARM and ELV), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, VSR, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based fungal disinfectants containing 70 % alcohol eliminate 99.97 % (a reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to a reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99 % to 99.999 % (a reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand disinfectants are practically ineffective against the norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. It should be used enough for antiseptic hands or alcohol-based to float, such as to moisturize or completely cover both hands.
The palm and the back of both hands, between the fingers and ends of all fingers are blown for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel are followed.
The fingertips should also be washed well, rubbing them on both palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend hand washing before hand disinfectants to rub, especially when hands are visiblely dirty.
The increased use of these agents is based on their ease of use and on the rapid elimination activity of micro-organisms; however, they should not be used as replacement for adequate hand washing unless there is no water or soap available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based hand disinfectants can re-drive the skin, unless emulsifiers or hydrants are added to the formula.
The effect of alcohol drying can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand disinfectants containing emulsifiers caused a significantly lower irritation and dryness of the skin than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic dermatitis by contact, urticaria by contact or hypersensitivity to alcohol or the additives present in alcohol-based solutions to flirt are very rare.
The slightest tendency to provoke irritant dermatitis by contact was attractive compared to hand washing with water and soap.
Despite its effectiveness, waterless agents do not remove the organic matter from their hands, but simply disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as water and soap to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain in their hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand disinfectants depends largely on the ingredients and the formula, moreover, historically, has been much less than that of alcohol and alcohol-based solutions to float.
More recently, it has been found that the formulas using benzalconium chloride have a persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose effectiveness decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot buy soap and use ash or land in exchange.
Ash or land can be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash are contaminated with microorganisms, this may increase the spread of diseases rather than decrease them.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant, since, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommended using ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The correct hand washing technique recommended by the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent transmission of diseases includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with hot or cold running water.
Current water is recommended because containers with frozen water may be contaminated, while the water temperature appears to make no difference.
Rinse your hands to form foam with a generous amount of soap, including the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.
The soap removes skin germs, and studies indicate that people usually wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using water alone.
Restrict for at least 20 seconds.
Restricting creates friction, which helps remove skin germs, and restricts more germs for longer periods.
Swim well with running water.
Playing in a container can contaminate your hands again.
Dry with a clean towel or let the air dry.
Wet and wet hands return to contamination with ease. The parts that are most often forgotten are thumb, fist, areas between fingers and under the nails
The artificial nails and the enamel of unscassed nails can accommodate micro-organisms.
Humidant lotion is often recommended to prevent hands from drying; dry skin may cause skin damage that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
Several economic options can be used to facilitate hand washing when there is no water available, for example, to pour water from a well or a well with suitable orifices or to use ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations where there is limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "cash" and other economic options.
A home grip is a simple technology that consists of using a suspended jar of a soybean and a leg activated to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a bar soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is a certain debate about the most effective form of drying in public bathrooms.
More and more are the research that indicates that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study, sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium Towels Industry, to compare the hygiene levels offered by paper towels, hot air towel dryers and more modern air towel dryers.
After washing and drying hands with the hot air dryer, it was detected that the total amount of bacteria increased, on average, 194 % in fingernails and 254 % in palm trees.
Drying with the air drain resulted in an average increase in the total amount of bacteria of 42 % in fingernails and 15 % in palms.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total amount of bacteria decreased, on average, 76% in fingernails and 77% in palms. Scientists also carried out tests to determine whether there was a possibility of cross contamination of other users of the bathroom and the bathroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The air-dried dryer, which breathes air from the unit to speeds, says 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), has been able to blow the microorganisms of the hands and the unit and, potentially, to contaminate other users of the bathroom and the bathroom environment at a distance of up to 2 metres.
The use of a hot air hand dryer spread the microorganisms up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Product und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.
The following changes were observed in the bacterial count after hand drying:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to the drying with paper towels.
Washing hands with hands disinfectant toilets is an alternative during travel, when there is no water or soap.
The hand disinfectant must contain at least 60 % of alcohol.
The washing of the hands of doctors became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) for disease prevention in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide comments to remind hospital staff who wash their hands when forgotten.
One study examined a decrease in the rate of infection with its use.
The hands washing of doctors is done for at least 15 seconds, with plenty of water and soap or gel to form foam and restrict all parts of the hands.
Hands should be restricted together by intertwining their fingers.
If there are residues under the nails, a pig brush can be used to remove them.
Since germinals can stay in the water in their hands, it is important to rinse them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hands from being contaminated again by these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the medical care environment is to remove and avoid transmission of pathogenic microorganisms ("Germans").
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, lack of hand washing continues to exist at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, where many doctors and nurses usually forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmit microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization has published a sheet demonstrating hand washing and standard hand frutation in the medical care sectors.
The preliminary version of the organization's hand hygiene guide can also be found on its website so that the public can comment.
Whitby and others carried out a relevant review.
Commercial devices may measure and verify hand hygiene if demonstration of compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has "five moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to blood or body fluids
before aseptic work and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (medicine soaps or antibacterial soaps) gives the possibility of eliminating the hand washing agent.
This elimination may be necessary before surgery or in environments in which antibiotics-resistant organisms are very common. To wash your hands before surgery, you need to have a grip that can be opened and closed without touching it with your hands, a little chlorhexidine or iodine for washing, sterile towels to dry your hands after washing, a sterilized brush to fry and another sterilized tool to clean under the nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires the washing of hands and forearms to the tail, in general, for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to wash for a long time (10 minutes).
When ingested, the water of the forearms should be prevented from returning to the hands.
After washing, the hands are dried with a sterilized cloth and a surgical bat is placed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after helping sick people.
To control infections caused by staphylococcus in hospitals, it has been proven that the highest benefit of hand cleaning is in the first 20% of the wash and that there is very little additional benefit when the rate of hand hygiene increases by more than 35%.
The common soap wash results in more than triple incidence of bacterial infections transmitted to food compared to the antibacterial soap wash. By comparing handwashing with an alcohol-based solution with handwashing with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds in each case, it was observed that the alcohol spray reduced the contamination of bacteria by 26% more than the antibacterial soap.
However, water and soap are more effective in reducing influenza A H1N1 virus and clostridium strains from the hands than alcohol-based hand disinfectants. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care centres may include training staff on hand washing, increasing availability of hand disinfectant based on alcohol and written and oral reminders to staff.
It is necessary to investigate more about which of these interventions are the most effective in the different health care environments.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered an economic and fundamental tool to achieve good health and even good food.
However, the lack of reliable supply of water, soap or facilities to wash hands in homes, schools and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve universal hand washing procedures.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa, there are very few grips to wash hands near public or private pensions, although there are economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates can also be the result of root habits rather than lack of soap or water.
The promotion of hand washing with soap can influence political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and bring about a change in behaviour in the long-term population.
In order for this to work effectively, it is necessary to follow up and evaluate.
In a systematic review of 70 studies, it was observed that community approaches are effective to increase hand washing in PRBMs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of promoting hand washing in schools is UNICEF's "three stars" approach, which encourages schools to take simple and economic measures to ensure that students wash hands with soap, including hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standards are reached, schools can go from one to three stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the hand-washing campaigns that are being carried out to reduce diseases and child mortality.
The World Hand Washing Day is another example of awareness campaign that seeks to achieve a change in behavior. As a result of the coronary plague 2019-2020, UNICEF promoted the creation of an emoji for hand washing.
Few studies have considered the overall profitability of hand washing in developing countries in relation to avoided AVADs.
However, an analysis indicates that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, particularly for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as mothers who have just given birth or soldiers to hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-20th century by two pioneers from hand hygiene: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, English, the "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people still believed that the infections were caused by unpleasant odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of food-borne diseases and health-related infections led the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more actively as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 made many countries more aware of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters were hung with "right hand washing techniques" along with the bathrooms of public bathrooms and bathrooms of office buildings and airports.
The phrase "wash your hands" is a statement that you do not want to take care of something or share the complexity of something.
It has its origin in the Bible passage of Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands before the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a much wider phrase of use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, which represents her conscience of guilt for the crimes she had committed and which she had induced her husband to commit.
It has also been proved that after remembering or reflecting on non-ethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to appreciate more elements for hand washing.
Moreover, those who have allowed the washing of hands after such reflection are less likely to get involved in other compensatory "cleaning" actions, such as a volunteer.
Religions recommend hand washing for hygienic and symbolic purposes. The washing of symbolic hands, with water, but without soap, is part of the washing of ritual hands in many religions, such as Bahaism, Hinduism, Tevila and Netilat yadayim in Judaism, the washing of Christianity and the wudu in Islam. Religions also recommend washing of hygienic hands, especially after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam force hands to be washed after going to the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sisyism, Judaism and Islam force hands to be washed before and after each meal.
Risk controls at the workplace in front of COVID-19
Risk controls at the workplace in front of COVID-19 relate to the application of hygiene and occupational safety methodologies in the risk controls for the prevention of coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate risk controls at the workplace depend on the workplace and on the job and are based on a risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk factors of workers who may be willing to contract COVID-19.
According to the United States Security and Occupational Health Administration (OSHA), work at a lower risk of exposure has minimal working contact with the public and workmates, for whom basic infection prevention measures are advised, including hand washing, the recommendation that workers stay at home if they are sick, respiratory hygiene standards and maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Medium-risk work includes those who require frequent or close contact with persons who are not known or suspected of having COVID-19 but who may be infected by the current Community transit or by an international journey.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, working environments with a lot of concentration of people and some large retail sales environments.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, protective covers and individual protection equipment available in case of a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that workers in health care and funeral services, exposed to or suspected of having COVID-19, have a high risk of exposure, which increases very high if they perform procedures that may generate aerosols in persons who are known or suspected to have COVID-19 or take or manipulate samples of these persons.
Appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as ventilation rooms with negative pressure, and individual protection equipment suitable for work.
The outbreaks of COVID-19 may have several consequences at the workplace.
Workers may miss work because they are sick, because they have to take care of others or because they are afraid of the possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both with regard to what goods are requested and with regard to the means of acquiring those goods (such as buying in hours that are not peaked, by sending to the home or by window from the car).
Lastly, consignments of articles from geographical areas seriously affected by COVID-19 could be interrupted; a plan for the preparation and response to infectious diseases could be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans address risk levels related to various workplaces and work activities, including exposure sources, risk factors arising from domestic and community environments and risk factors for individual workers, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also describe the controls necessary to address these risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Plans to prepare and respond to infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
Among the objectives of the response to a outbreak are to reduce the transmission among staff members, to protect those at greater risk of adverse health complications, to maintain commercial operations and to minimize adverse effects on other entities of their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the company is located affects the measures taken.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a widely used framework for hygiene and occupational safety to classify risk controls according to their effectiveness.
If the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by the administrations and, ultimately, individual protection teams.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without resorting to workers' behaviour and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in the policies or working procedures that require action by the worker or the employer.
Individual protection teams are considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but may help prevent some exhibitions.
All types of individual protective equipment must be selected according to the risk to the worker, placed as appropriate (e.g., the breathers), used properly and systematically, reviewed frequently, maintained, replaced and removed, cleaned and disposed of properly, or disposed of in order not to contaminate.
According to the U.S. Health and Occupational Safety Administration (OSHA), work at a lower risk of exposure has minimal working contact with the public and workmates.
The measures for the prevention of basic infections recommended for all workplaces include deep and frequent hand washing, the recommendation to workers to stay at home if they are sick, the standards of respiratory hygiene that include covering themselves when coughing and stunning, the provision of paper panels and containers for waste, preparation for telework or shifts if necessary, deterring workers from using foreign tools and equipment and maintaining a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Immediate identification and isolation of people who may be infected is a fundamental measure to protect workers, customers, visitors and others at work.
The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that employees with acute respiratory disease symptoms stay in their homes until they stop having fever, signs of fever and any other symptoms during at least 24 hours without taking medicines to relieve symptoms or reduce fever; that the policies of disease-related licences be flexible and allow employees to stay at home to care for a sick family, and that employees know these policies.
According to OSHA, medium-risk work includes those who require frequent or close contact at least six feet (1.8 m) with persons who do not know or are suspected of having COVID-19, but who could have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 because of the community transmission of the moment around the location of the company, or because the person made an international trip recently to a place with generalized COVID-19 transmission.
These include workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, working environments with a lot of concentration of people and some large retail environments. Engineering controls for this group and the higher risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, the increase of ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic envelopes and the placement of a window for the care service so that the client can request from the car. Administrative controls for this group and the higher risk groups include recommending to sick workers who are staying at home, replacing the presence of virtual communications, setting up escalated shifts, suspending travel that are not essential to sites with existing COVID-19 outbreaks, developing a care window for the care provider, developing emergency communications plans that require you to work on behalf of persons who are able to work on a case-by-requestor,
Workers in this risk group should rarely use breathing agents.
If a person is sick on a plane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from the other person at a distance of 6 feet, appointing a crew member to care for the sick person and offering him a mask to the sick person or asking him to cover his mouth and nose with paper panels when coughing or numb.
Cabin crew should use disposable surgical gloves to serve a sick passenger or to touch potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and, perhaps, individual protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistentness or difficulty breathing.
In the case of commercial navigation, such as cruisers and other passenger ships, risk controls include delaying the journey by disease, self-insulation and immediately informing the medical centre on board if someone has fever or other symptoms while on board.
It is ideal that medical check-ups be carried out in the isolation cabin. In the case of schools and childcare centres, CDCs recommend short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person was in the school building, regardless of community transmission.
When community transmission is minimal or moderate, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as the cancellation of excursions, assemblies and other mass meetings, such as physical or corrosive education classes or meals in the dining room, increased space between the posters, the escalation of entry and exit schedules, the limitation of non-essential visits and the use of a separate place for the health room for children with flu symptoms.
When there is a significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, it can be considered to extend the cancellation of classes. For police personnel carrying out daily routine activities, the CDCs consider that the immediate risk to health is low.
It is recommended that police officers contact persons with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 who follow the same pattern as emergency medical technicians, including the use of personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during a detention, workers must clean and disinfect their work belt and their equipment with an aerosol or household cleaning towels before re-use them and follow the standard operating procedure for the retention and disposal of personal protective equipment and the retention and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers that certain health and morgue workers are in high or very high exposure risk categories.
Among the high-risk exposure work are those of delivery, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspicions of COVID-19.
These become very high-risk work if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspicions of COVID-19 or if they take or manipulate samples of these patients.
Some aerosol generation procedures are intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations or invasive sampling.
High-risk morgue work includes those in which workers are involved in the preparation of corpses of persons with COVID-19 or suspected of having it at the time of death; they pass a very high risk of exposure if they carry out autopsyes. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19, even when they are carried out with aerosol generation procedures.
Specialized ventilation with negative pressure may be appropriate in some medical care and morgue environments.
Samples should be handled by taking biosafety level precautions 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients entering different waiting rooms be separated depending on whether or not they are suspected of having COVID-19. In addition to other types of personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of masks for those persons working up to 6 feet away from patients who have been infected or suspected of having been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and those who carry out aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, N95 breathing must be used with filter mask approved by NIOSH or higher in the context of a written comprehensive respiratory program that includes tests of adjustment, training and medical examinations.
Other types of masks can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend the use of protective monkeys, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not one that is transmitted by body fluids.
WHO recommends only the use of a surgical mask for the classification staff of patients entering.
For those who take respiratory samples of patients with COVID-19, give them attention or transport them without conducting aerosol generation procedures, WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, glasses or facial protector, bat and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask should be replaced by a breather N95 or FFP2.
Because the provision of personal protection equipment is insufficient, WHO recommends minimising the need to use them, replacing them with telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting the permit to enter a patient's room with COVID-19 only to those involved in their direct care, using the same mask without removing it while giving attention to several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal protection equipment and encouraging the use of masks by asymptomatic individuals.

QUESTION: [Covid-19] To lighten the load and prepare for the future
DATE/ DAY OF REVISION: 14 March 2020, 00:24 h, coordinated universal time
LICENCE: CC0: No reserved rights
This month, we are in unique circumstances.
The epidemic of COVID-19 highlights our human interconnection at the global level and the responsibilities we have with each other.
The challenges we face have no precedents, but we know that our best response is to the solidarity, cooperation and global community-building that are at the heart of this organization.
The friendship and concern that we have seen among all our companions in e-mail messages, calls and conversations is a great validation of how incredible the people with whom we are lucky to work are.
I couldn't feel more grateful and proud that all of you were my companions.
Last week, someone shared with me the appreciation I felt for our work.
They reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to go to Wikipedia right now and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available to all.
Their work makes this possible, whether by maintaining the sites in operation, helping our companions receive their payment or by keeping our communities safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides, today more than ever.
This is a moment in which not only what we do but how we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and its role in this, from next week, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together.
Adjustments to our work and our schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to talk about our approach and our timetable for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we consider what we believe would be a proper response to what we are facing and what would be the best way to maintain the sustainability of the organization at this time.
To a greater extent, we wanted to eliminate the stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to slow down, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors and contract workers:
our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, until next notice.
We are not declaring a holiday; if you can work on a more normal schedule, this would be of great benefit to the mission.
However, the world is an unpredictable place now, and whether you have to take care of your loved ones, shopping or going to a doctor, our priority is your well-being.
We're not taking account of your hours.
If he's sick, he doesn't work.
Although you shouldn't have to say it, we say it.
There is no need to apply for sick leave or paid free time; just report to your manager and help your team review the schedules and schedules to make sure that the key areas of the work are covered.
(If you receive a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, notify Bryan of T&C operations so that T&C can help with the support and ensure that the management is in such a position).
The people who work per hour will receive the total payment.
As we have said, we renew our commitment to our contractors and staff members working per hour.
All will be paid on the basis of their normal working hours under normal circumstances.
This applies also if you are sick and cannot work.
If you want to work, you have our support.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in these times.
Again, this is about your personal care.
What we ask them is that they communicate with their manager so that we know what to expect and can adapt properly.
Some work is considered essential.
There are some things we need to keep doing.
Site Reliability Engineering, Human Resources Operations, Trust and Security and Fund Recovery teams, among others, are carrying out a critical work that may require additional support.
We will start a process with all departments to assess the current objectives and modify our approach to support what is essential to our mission.
There are enough tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we will all focus on the most essential projects.
Reducing speed today won't hurt us tomorrow.
We don't plan to "double the hours to get us up to date" when the pandemic ends.
You will not be expected to work extra hours to meet deadlines that are no longer realistic.
We accept that the circumstances have changed and we will work to establish new objectives and deadlines when appropriate.
What happens to the APP, or Annual Planning?
To meet our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we plan to adjust the schedule for delivery of our Annual Planning from 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan to allocate more time to the budget so that employees can prioritise critical work, personal care and care of loved ones as we adapt to the needs of those who need or want to work with a reduced schedule over the next few weeks.
This extension of our timetable greatly reduces the current planning and pressure burdens across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and will communicate the next steps to the delegates and the teams we have only one confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for their leadership in this situation.
Status, presentation and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our partners in the San Francisco office might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we hired an anti-viral cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used an antiviral solution for hospital use to disinfect all surfaces, in addition to the reception and elevators that go to our floor.
The building has adopted its own responsibility protocol, using products that support the safety of its occupants.
We feel confident that the office will be well prepared for when we decide to come back.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which has shared its protocol for COVID-19 with us and all staff members in the DC offices.
Since last week, our DC office has moved its operations to a completely remote environment in accordance with the shared guidelines with San Francisco.
As some of our associates in New York City already know, we also talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still under way, but it is possible that they will be delayed.
Some of our partners work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working remotely before know that this mode requires adaptation, so they provide the following suggestions:
Limits the duration of meetings to periods of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider how to divide them over several days.
It clearly defines the meeting with a list of themes and sends the reading material in advance.
Adopt video usage by default, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and connection in live.
It appoints a leader to modulate each meeting, a person who controls the questions in the chat and list of speakers, and someone who helps to take notes (or take notes collaboratively).
Send an e-mail to technical support if you need comfortable earphones.
Use the refrigeration welfare refund.
Join #remotes in Slack to talk to your partners about distributed work
The RR.H. Operations Team is analysing the guidelines on ergonomics based on web seminars to support the increase in the work distributed throughout the Foundation.
This past week we have asked all beneficiaries of Community grants to cancel the public events funded by Wikimedia, such as editions, until the WHO declares the end of the pandemic.
We informed them that we understood that our request for cancellations and other restrictions could make it impossible to carry out their part of the activities agreed for the grant and that there would be no penalty for having to delay or modify those objectives.
This next week we will follow up with additional guidelines in Wikimania and other Community and regional thematic conferences.
The general feeling of the community at the global level seems to be, in part, sadness over the interruption and, in part, relief from the clarity and ability to focus on its own communities, both from Wikimedia and others.
Later, CRT will be working to establish a page in Meta-Wiki in order to provide the community with space to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Keep in touch with COVID-19 matters
We will send them an invitation through their calendars for the next Thursday, 14:00 h, Universal Time Coordinated/07/00 h, Pacific Time, for a special staff meeting.
We will take this opportunity to share additional news, answer your questions and spend time connecting each other.
We are together in this and are available to help in the way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to find the information of this email message and all the additional essential information related to COVID-19 in Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages up to date and all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff living in countries currently heavily affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, an important workflow, any coverage problem or anything you may need help with, do not hesitate to notify CRT and work with them.
We are here to help provide support and function as a link when necessary.
If you have confidential or sensitive issues, send an e-mail to Bryan Judah, Director of International Global Operations of RR. HH.
None of these changes should be considered as abandonment of our work and our obligations.
Instead, I am grateful that, at this point, our work and our obligations should probably be adapted in a way that had not happened before.
These are the measures we believe are necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, give our movement the necessary support and provide the world with the service it trusts.
Our planned work will continue there for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and make room for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and, possibly, in the coming months.
We need all of you to make this possible and, therefore, we need your families to care and care for them so that they can be in the best possible state when the need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the rest of Liderazgo's team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M and Toby N).
Angiotensin 2 (ECA2) converting enzyme is an enzyme that adheres to the outer surface (cellular membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ECA2 counteracts the activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ECA) related by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), which makes it a therapeutic day for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also serves as an entry point for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is generally called hECA2.
Angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is a metaloenzyme that contains zinc and is found on the surface of endothelial cells and other types.
ECA2 protein contains a N-terminal domain of peptidase M2 and a C-terminal domain of collecrine amino acids.
ECA2 is a single-type I membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed to the surface of the cells of the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is removed from the transmembranal domain by another enzyme known as shedase and, as a result, the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and is eventually excreted through the urine.
ECA2 is present in most organs: ECA2 is primarily attached to the cell membrane of the Type II alveolar cells of the lungs, the enterocytes of the soft intestine, the arterial and endothelial venous cells and the arterial cells of the smooth muscle of most organs.
ECA2's mARN expression is also found in the brain cortex, the stranded body, the hypothalamus, and the brain stem.
The main function of ECA2 is to counter the ECA.
The ECA releases angiotensin I hormone and forms angiotensin II, which is vasoconstrictor.
ECA2, in turn, releases the angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) carboxyl-terminal phenylalanine amino acid and hydrolyses it to form the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ECA2 can also break down several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradiquinine, orange, neurotensin, dinorphine A and grelin.
ECA2 also regulates the movement of membranes of the transporter of neutral amino acids SLC6A19 and has been associated with Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 serves as the main entry point for some coronary viruses, including HCV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the association of the S1 spy protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the enzyme domain of ECA2 on the surface of cells results in endocytosis and the transfer of the virus along with the enzyme to endosomas within the cells.
This input process also requires the preparation of the S protein by the guest's TMPRSS2 protein serum, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as possible therapy. This has led to certain assumptions that reducing ECA2 levels in cells could help to fight infection.
However , several professional associations and regulators have recommended continuing ECA and standard BRA inhibitor therapy .
A systematic meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ECA inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control cases".
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients who were treated with ECA inhibitors and had a higher risk of pneumonia, in particular those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ECA inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were not so solid for the overall risk of pneumonia."
The recombinant human ECA2 (rhECA2) appears to be a new therapy for acute pulmonary injury and seems to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in lactones with acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipopolysaccharides.
The mean life of rhECA2 in human beings is approximately 10 hours and the start of action is 30 minutes in addition to the 24 hour duration.
Several findings suggest that rhECA2 could be a promising medicine for those people with intolerance to the classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (SRA inhibitors) or in diseases with high circulating angiotensin II. The infusion of rhECA2 was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile devices designed to help track contacts in response to the 2019-2020 coronary pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") that could have been in contact with a infected person.
Various applications were developed or proposed with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact tracking applications.
Concerns related to privacy have been raised, in particular, with regard to systems based on the tracking of the geographical location of users of the application.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as using Bluetooth signals to record the proximity of a user to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based applications directly on their iOS and Android operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has implemented an application that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It is already in use in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore it is using an application called TraceTogether.
The application was developed by a local IT community, launched as an open-source application and will be handed over to the government. In North Macedonia, "StopKorona!" was launched, an application based on Bluetooth to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
Implementation was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the application was awaiting the approval of Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government reported that the tracking of contacts was at an advanced development stage and that it would be available for implementation in the coming weeks.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether application and the Singapore BlueTrace protocol. Russia plans to introduce a geoperimetry application for patients living in Moscow and have received a diagnosis of COVID-19, designed to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of Safety Engineering at the University of Cambridge, presented a number of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and possible lack of effectiveness if the adoption of implementation is limited to a small part of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of fraudulent or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple limited the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related applications in its App Store to "official" or trust-only organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance through the applications of the coronavirus and, in particular, whether the infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations submitted a communication requiring limits to this kind of monitoring.
The organizations established eight conditions for government projects:
monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
monitoring and monitoring extensions should have extinction clauses;
the use of data should be limited to objectives related to COVID-19;
security and anonymity should be protected and there should be evidence of such protection;
Digital surveillance should avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties should be defined in the laws;
Protection against abuse should be implemented and the rights of citizens should be established to respond to such abuse;
the significant participation of all "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and marginalised groups, will be mandatory. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter without Borders, RSF) of Germany also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by withdrawing the tracking mechanism from your operating systems when you no longer need it.
In some countries, a network-based location was used instead of applications, eliminating both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw data from locations present potential problems of significant privacy.
However, it is not necessary for all central server systems to have access to personal location data; several privacy protection systems have been created that use central servers only for intercom (see the following section).
In South Korea, a system that is not based on an application was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and transaction data with credit cards, and combined them to generate warning messages through text messages for potentially infected persons.
In addition to using this information to warn about possible contacts, the government has also made information on the location available to the public, something that is allowed due to wide-ranging changes to the privacy laws of the information after the outbreak of MRS in that country.
This information is available to the public through various applications and websites. Some countries, including Germany, have considered using centralized and privacy protection systems.
As of 6 April 2020, details have not yet been published.
The tracking of contacts with privacy protection is a well-established concept, with a large number of published investigations going back to at least 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on respectful privacy solutions, such as the use of low-energy Bluetooth (BLE) to record the proximity of a user to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized proximity tracking to preserve privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, previously known as contact event numbers, CEN) and protocols and mechanisms for mobile contact tracking for privacy protection (PACT), among others.
In these protocols, personal identification data never come out of the device and all matching occurs in the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group has been developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of techniques that protect privacy when collecting and using location or intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on the research of the technical report "Applications outside control: how to maintain privacy during an epidemic", published in March 2020. Another similar effort is Enigma MPC's SafeTrace platform, a company that develops privacy technologies that was also originally based on MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies that allow your users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of such data.
On 5 April 2020, several groups around what was essentially the same approach and with highly coincident protocols formed the Global TCN Coalition with a view to reducing fragmentation and allowing for global interoperability of tracking and alert applications, a key aspect for broad adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had opened the code of the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government application.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google, companies that control iOS and Android mobile platforms, announced an initiative to track contacts that, they said, would protect privacy, which is based on the combination of low-energy Bluetooth technology and privacy protection cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the aim is to implement the system in three stages:
implementation of tools for governments to create official crown virus tracking applications that protect privacy
integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to address the problems of persistent adoption and monitoring by first distributing the system through updates of the operating system and then removing them from the same way once the threat has passed.
b'Refiling (also known as repositioning or therapeutic change) is the re-adjustment of a drug approved for the treatment of a disease that is not the one for which it was originally developed.
This is in line with the scientific research that currently seeks to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research lines include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and plasma transfusion of convalescent. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemomodulable proteins, each of which has multiple binding sites.
Analysis of these union sites provides the reasonable basis for the project to develop an effective antiviral drug against the proteins of COVID-19.
Among the most important daily proteins in SARS-CoV-2 are papaya-like protease, RNA-controlled polymerase, helicase, S-protein, and ribophosphate ADP.
Hussein A. A. et al. studied several compounds of medical interest that then optimized and analyzed to identify the similarity of their main chain with the most approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a powerful drug against SARS-CoV-2 in their preclinical study and recommend it for the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antipaludic medicine that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that related chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs to be studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that the New York State tests with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24th. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate by means of an emergency use authorisation (USA).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised according to an U.S. only as an experimental treatment for urgent use in patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
CDCs said that "the use, dose or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
Doctors have said they use the drug when "there is no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
At Duke University and Oxford University, major studies are underway.
The NYU Langone Medical Faculty is conducting a safety and efficacy study on the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have shown that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen were negative on an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir, while the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence supporting the drug is limited and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would buy the drug to Japan for its reservations and that it would use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where it will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made proposals to the Trump Administration on the purchase of the drug. The drug may be less effective in serious cases of the disease if the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antivirals lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefits were observed".
Drugs were designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by joining the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that joins the SARS-CoV-2 protease. In the scientific community, there have been criticisms about the allocation of resources to the rehabilitation of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the International Solidarity Test.
Remedesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remedesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against multiple filviruses, neumoviruses, paramixoviruses and coronaviruses.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that may result in a more severe disease and transmission.
Some initial studies prior to the trials suggest that remedesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two conducted by hospitals at the University of Cleveland; one for people with moderate disease and the other for those with more serious disease.
Three intravenous vitamin C clinical trials are in progress for people who are hospitalized and severely affected by COVID-19; two placebo-controlled patients (China, Canada) and one without control (Italy).
The state of New York started testing with the azithromycin antibiotic on 24 March 2020.
Japan's National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial with Teijin Alvesco (cyclesonide), an inhalable asthma corticosteroid, as treatment for asymptomatic patients infected by the new coronary virus.
An angiotensin 2 converting enzyme form, a phase II trial is under way and 200 severe hospitalized patients will be enrolled in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is enrolled in 6000 adults aged 40 years and over with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant women who are breast-feeding or who do not have an affective contraceptive method are not eligible.
Various anticoagulants are being evaluated in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, so the Italian Medicines Agency published guidelines on its use.
On 14 April, a multicentre study was announced in Italy with 300 patients investigating the use of sodium enoxaparin at preventive and therapeutic doses.
As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists are paying great attention to the re-adjustment of antiviral drugs that have developed for previous outbreaks of the SROM virus, the SARAG and the Western Nile.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese patterns
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese patterns
These are some treatments that have been identified for possible re-adjustment for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (block IL-6 receptor): approved by China.

b'A vaccine against COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are many ongoing attempts to develop that vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, in less than 18 months.
In April, five possible vaccines were in phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
An important outbreak spread around the world in 2020, triggering considerable investments and research activities to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Established in April, the requirements of the ECI Initiative for the Development of a Vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, scale implementation and global access.
In April, ECI scientists reported that 10 different technological platforms were being researched and developed in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The following are among the days of the main platforms that have passed to phase I security studies:
nucleic acid (ADN and RNA) (phase I developer and possible vaccine: Modern, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and possible vaccine: CanSino Biologicals, type 5 adenovirus vector)
According to ECIP scientists in April, a total of 115 possible vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of which are confirmed in active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and 37 others are announced, but with little information available (it is assumed that they are planning or developing).
A phase I or II test is performed with preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually randomized, controlled by placebo and carried out in several locations, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease while controlling the adverse effects of the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active development vaccines (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in human evaluation (continued in preclinical research).
About January 24, 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecularly subjected vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune response.
About 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work in a vaccine and expects human tests to begin in 2021.
Vaccines development projects were announced at the Center for Control and Prevention of China's Diseases on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
About January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had begun to develop a vaccine.
Janssen is developing an oral vaccine with his biotech partner, Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing association with Vaxart for the development of the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document designing a vaccine similar to that used in the treatment of neo-antigenic cancer vaccines.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the vaccine synthesis and that the trials were beginning.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary of Genex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that he was starting a project to create a li-key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a possible vaccine that could be tested in humans "within 90 days".
On 5 March 2020, the University of Washington, San Luis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both west Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
About March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had joined Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for a clinical trial and a phase I clinical trial for July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that it was working with 11 isolates and that, despite rapid progress, it would take at least one and a half years to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a company of biotechnology in the city of Quebec, Quebec, reported the development of a particle similar to the coronary virus with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The possible vaccine is in the laboratory research phase and human testing is expected to begin in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "a large amount of money for exclusive access to a vaccine against COVID-19", before which the German government complained.
On 17 March 2020, the U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced an association with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an ARNm-based vaccine.
The possible vaccine based on RNAm BNT162 is currently under preclinical testing and clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have the results of preclinical tests in April 2020 and that human tests of the possible final vaccine could begin in the fall.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovation in Epidemic Preparation (CEPI) announced an investment of USD 4.9 million in a research alliance of a vaccine against COVID-19, which includes the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total ECI investment for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to USD 29 million.
The other CEPI partners for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 are Modern, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, Oxford University and University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists started testing in animals of six possible vaccines.
Researchers at the Imperial College of London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing an RNA vaccine with self-replication against COVID-19.
The possible vaccine developed within 14 days of receiving the Chinese sequence.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced funding of CAD 275 million for 96 medical research projects to counter COVID-19, including a large number of possible vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago initiatives and the University of Saskatchewan.
About the same time, the Canadian Government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, with plans to create a "national bank of vaccines" with several new vaccines that could be used if another outbreak of coronavirus occurs.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh University Medical School announced PittCoVacc's evidence, a possible vaccine against COVID-19, in mice and said that "the S1 subunit vaccines of SARS-CoV-2 administered by MNA received powerful responses from the specific antibodies of antigens (in mice) that were evident two weeks after vaccination".
In Canada, on 16 April 2020, the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Waterloo announced the design of a possible DNA-based vaccine as a likely nasal sprayer.
Using bacteria, DNA will be designated to replicate within the human bacteria and produce virus-like inoculated particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access IBM supercomputers, along with computing resources in the cloud of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have non-specific effects.
This means that they can benefit beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to register 4170 health workers.
The vaccines being developed may not be safe or effective.
Initial investigations to assess the effectiveness of vaccines with specific animal models of COVID-19, such as the transgenic mouse expressed by ECA2, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, show the need to have level 3 biosecurity conservation measures for the handling of live viruses and with international coordination to ensure standardised safety procedures.
Vaccines against SRAG and SROM have been tested in non-human animal models.
By 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against SRAG that has proved to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research publications from 2005 to 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SRAG was a priority for Governments and public health agencies around the world. There is no confirmed vaccine against SROM.
When the SROM was generalized, it was believed that the existing investigation into SRAG could be a useful template for developing vaccines and treatments against the infection by MERS-CoV.
In March 2020, a SROM vaccine (ADN-based) completed phase I clinical trials in humans, three others were currently underway, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenovir vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications in the social media promoted a conspiracy theory that the virus causing COVID-19 was known and already had a vaccine.
Patents cited by various social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus, such as the SARAG coronavirus.
b'Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms are fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of breath and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but it can vary between two and fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multi-organism insufficiency.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, with more than 153 000 deaths.
More than 568 000 people have been recovered. The virus is mainly spread among people during close contact, usually through gouts that occur when coughing, strangling or talking.
Although these drops occur when exhaling, they usually fall on the floor or on the surfaces, instead of being contaminating at long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touch the eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on the surface for up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread is also possible before symptoms and late stages of the disease appear. The standard method for diagnosis is the reaction in the polymerase chain with inverse transcription in real time (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal hyopate.
The use of masks is recommended for those suspected of having the virus and its caregivers.
Recommendations on the use of masks for the general public vary. Some authorities recommend that they be not used, others recommend that they be used, while others require their use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment against COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
Those infected by the virus may be asymptomatic or have symptoms similar to those of the flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest, confusion, difficulty walking and face or blue lips. If these symptoms are present, it is recommended to seek medical attention immediately.
It is less common to observe symptoms in the upper respiratory tract, such as dizziness, nasal discharge and throat pain.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been identified in variable percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented breast pressure and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease progressed to pneumonia, multi-organism insufficiency, and death.
This is called incubation period.
The incubation period of the COVID-19 usually ranges from five to six days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
97.5% of people with symptoms do so within 11.5 days of infection. According to reports, not all infected have symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people with no symptoms is unknown for the time being and is being studied. The Centers for Control and Prevention of Korea’s Diseases (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of confirmed cases continued to be asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in daily cases on 1 April. Of the 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic when the test was carried out.
Both spouts and saliva can have great viral loads.
Speaking out loud frees more drops than when talking with a normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that not covering the mouth to the cough can make the droplets travel 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not often air transmission, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that the transmission through biological aerosols is possible and explained that air collectors in the corridor outside the people's dormitories gave positive results in viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary animation (RCP) may cause air-insulation of respiratory secretions and therefore air transmission.
While there are concerns about the possibility of spreading the facts, it is believed that the risk is low. The virus is more contagious when people have symptoms; although the spread is possible before the onset of the symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) explains that, although it is not quite clear how easy it is to spread, a person is generally infected with two or three more. The virus survives hours or days on the surface.
Specificly, the virus was detected for one day in the carton, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours in products with 99 % copper.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
The soap and detergent are also effective if used properly. The soap products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus and disable it, as well as remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorohexidine glucanate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
In five of six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load. In the case of the sixth patient, the highest viral load was observed on the second day of test.
The acute respiratory syndrome coronation virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronation virus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the related natural coronavirus.
Outside the human body, the domestic soap kills the virus, as it restores its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs of COVID-19, because the virus enters host cells by converting angiotensin I type 2 (ECA2) to enter the host cells, which is more abundant in the lung type II alveolar cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "specula" (peplomer) to connect with ECA2 and enter the host cell.
In 12% of people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, an acute heart injury was identified, which is more common in severe disease.
The rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease development, but acute myocardial injury may be related to ECA2 receptors in the heart.
ECA2 receptors have a high expression in the heart and participate in their operation.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was detected in patients with COVID-19 virus infection and may be associated with poor prognosis. In the autopsys of people who died with COVID-19, diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) and inflammatory infiltrates with lymphocytes were detected.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropics for epithelial cells that express the ECA2 of respiratory pathways, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was observed that T lymphocytes secretors of GM-CSF pathogens are correlated with the recruitment of IL-6 secretors monocytes and a severe pulmonary disease in patients with COVID-19.
In autopsies, lymphocyte infiltrates were also reported.
WHO has published several test protocols to detect the disease.
The standard test method is the polymerase chain reaction with inverse real-time transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed in samples of the respiratory pathways obtained by a nasopharyngeal hyopause; however, samples of nasal or spouty hyopauses can also be used.
Generally, the results are available within a few hours or two days.
Blood analysis can also be used, but two samples of blood should be taken with two weeks of difference and the results have very little immediate value.
Chinese scientists managed to isolate the strain of the coronavirus and published the genetic sequence so that world laboratories could independently develop polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) to detect virus infection.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and if the person has been infected in the past) were being developed but were not widely used.
Experience in China with evidence has shown that accuracy is only 60 to 70 per cent.
The FDA in the United States approved the first immediate diagnostic test on 21 March 2020 to be used by the end of that month. The diagnostic patterns published by the Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggest methods to detect infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobular enamelled glass opacitys with a peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are common in the initial stages of the infection.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain may appear, pattern in disordered rock (loud septal thickening with variable alveolar fill) and consolidation.
Few data are available on microscopic lesions and COVID-19 physiopathology.
The main pathological results of autopsy are as follows:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of viric pneumonia can be observed:
light pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pulmonary hyperplasia, atypically large pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of giant cells with multiple nuclei
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoxemia.
healing pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (CID); leukoerthroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the possibility of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, washing hands with water and soap frequently for at least 20 seconds, having good breathing hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands.
The CDCs recommend covering the mouth and nose with a towel when coughing or shaking and, in the absence of panels, use the inner part of the tail.
Appropriate hand hygiene is recommended after coughing or shaking.
CDCs have recommended the use of screen covers in public places, one of the reasons is to limit the transmission by asymptomatic persons. Social distance strategies seek to reduce the contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and canceling multi-stakeholder public meetings.
The distance patterns also indicate that persons must maintain a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no effective remedy to prevent COVID-19. Since there is not expected to be a vaccine until 2021, as soon as possible, a key part to control COVID-19 is to try to prevent the epidemic peak, which is known as "placing the curve".
CDCs also recommend washing hands frequently with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when hands are obviously dirty, before eating and after ringing the nose, coughing or shaking.
They also recommend the use of an alcohol-based hand disinfectant with a minimum of 60% of alcohol, but only when there is no water and soap available on time. For areas where hand disinfectants are not easy to achieve, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity results from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterium spores in alcohol; "it is not an active substance for hand-antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are given supportive care, which may include rehydration, oxygen therapy and treatment for other vital organs affected.
CDCs recommend that those suspected of having the virus use a simple mask.
Extrabody membrane oxygenation (OEC) has been used to address the problem of respiratory insufficiency, but the benefits are still being analysed.
To improve immunity, personal hygiene and lifestyle and healthy nutrition have been recommended.
Support treatments can be useful for those with mild symptoms at the initial stage of infection. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensifiers and neurologists in the U.S. have compiled recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For initial treatment of symptoms, some medical professionals recommend elegamol (acetaminophene), instead of ibuprofen.
Caution should be taken to minimise the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care environments when conducting procedures that may generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
CDCs recommend that health care professionals take care of people with COVID-19 to place the patient in an air infection isolation area (AIIR), in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and precautions to avoid air transmission. CDCs highlight the guidelines for the use of personal protection equipment (EPP) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is EPP boat, mask, protective fronts and medical gloves. When available, breathers (instead of masks) are preferred.
N95 masks are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorized their use by means of an emergency use authorisation (USA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but there is no guarantee of effectiveness against a specific biological agent that is not specified in the product indications.
When no masks are available, the CDCs recommend the use of protective caps or, as a last resort, home masks.
Most COVID-19 cases are not severe enough to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but a percentage of cases are.
This type of respiratory support is being actively studied for people hospitalized with respiratory impairment related to COVIDA-19 and there is already some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high flow nasal channel or positive bispression on respiratory pathways.
It is still not known whether any of these two benefit the same person in critical condition.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to the high flow nasal canal. Serious cases occur mainly in older adults (the older than 60 years and, in particular, the older than 80 years).
Many developed countries do not have sufficient head-to-head beds in hospitals, limiting the capacity of the health system to manage the sudden increase in severe cases of COVID-19 that require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% was admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30 per cent of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are eventually transferred to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex when a patient with COVID-19 has acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) and oxygenation is increasingly difficult.
Respirators with different modes of pressure control and PPTE are required to maximize oxygen supply while minimising the risk of pulmonary injury associated with the respiratory system and the pneumotorax.
The oldest respirators may not have high PPTE.
The investigation into possible treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remedesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new medicines may take up to 2021, several medicines that are already being tested are already approved for other uses or are in advanced tests.
Antiviral medicines can be tested in people with severe illness.
WHO recommends that volunteers participate in testing for the effectiveness and safety of possible treatments. The FDA granted temporary authorisation to plasma of contaminant as experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is at serious and immediate risk.
It has not been submitted to the clinical studies necessary to demonstrate whether it is safe and effective for a disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users must enter their name and identification number.
The application can detect the "close contact" and therefore a potential risk of infection through surveillance data.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a possible risk is detected, the application not only recommends self-confining, but also warns local health officials. Analysis of mobile information macrodata, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those who were in contact with them in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government allowed security agencies to track data on the mobile phones of persons suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen the quarantine and to protect those who could contact infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared summary data on phone location with the German federal government agency Robert Koch Institute in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia implemented facial recognition technology to detect quarantine deficiencies.
Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera said mobile telephony operators have informed him that "in any case, 40% of people are still moving".
The German Government carried out a 48-hour weekend hack with more than 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global request for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may feel anxious about the quarantine, the travel restrictions and the side effects of treatment or fear of infection themselves.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying: "The growing social isolation, loneliness, anxiety about health, stress and economic problems are a perfect storm for mental health and the well-being of people."
The disease may continue to evolve slightly with little or no symptoms, so other diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as the common cold, will appear.
Light cases are usually recovered within two weeks, while serious or critical cases may take between three and six weeks to do so.
Pregnant women may be at risk of contracting a serious infection of the COVID-19 virus, according to data from other similar viruses, such as the SRAG virus and the SROM, but the data from the COVID-19 are insufficient. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In cases of more serious illness, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to water breathing difficulty syndrome (SDRA) that causes respiratory failure, septic shock and multi-organism insufficiency.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, changes in coagulation and cardiac, renal and hepatic damage.
The impairment of coagulation, specifically the increase in protombin time, has been reported in 6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19; while the change in renal function is observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with CODIV-19 have high liver enzymes (aminotransferases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, for patients transferred to ICU, an average of seven days elapsed between hospitalization and death.
In an initial case study, the mean time from first symptoms to death was 14 days, with a complete range of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, the mortality rate among men was 2.8 per cent and among women was 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem samples of the lungs show diffuse alveolar damage with exuded cellular fibromyxoids in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The image of the lungs was similar to the acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, cardiac damage resulted from high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to the March data in the United States, 89 per cent of hospitalized people had a pre-existing condition. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic aspects of a region could also affect mortality.
Mortality estimates for the disease vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The insufficient number of mild cases may cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases in the past may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers had 1.4 times more chances of severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more chances of needing intensive care or dying compared to non-smokers. They were concerned about the long-term sequelae of this disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20-30 per cent reduction in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and images of the lungs suggest organ damage.
This may also cause the syndrome after intensive care after recovery.
In March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infections generated effective long-term immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
Immunity seems to be possible, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases recovered from COVID-19 have been reported that have subsequently been positive in coronaviruses.
These cases are believed to be an exacerbation of a persistent infection and not a reinfection.
This virus is considered natural and of animal origin by means of an interspecific infection.
The real origin is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to the transmission between humans.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, indicated as the first date of onset of symptoms as at 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications reported that the first manifestation of symptoms was on 8 December 2019.
In general, several measures are being taken to quantify mortality.
These figures vary from region to region and over time, in addition to being affected by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time spent since the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned emergency CIE-10 disease codes U07.1 to deaths confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 to deaths with a clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 without confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection laboratory. The mortality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed at a given time period.
Based on statistics from the University of Johns Hopkins, the overall mortality rate is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191) to 17 April 2020.
The number varies from region to region. Other measures include the mortality rate in diagnosed patients (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed who die of a disease, and the mortality rate in infected people, which reflects the percentage of people infected (with or without a diagnosis) who die of a disease.
These statistics do not depend on time and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people produce antibodies, their presence may provide information on how many people have been infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small villa of 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread during carnival festivals and affected the younger ones, so there was relatively low mortality, and it is possible that not all deaths by COVID-19 have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been exceeded.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population has antibodies, according to blood donors.
It has been confirmed that 69 (0.004 per cent of the population) died of COVID-19.
The impact of pandemic and mortality rates are different for men and women.
Mortality is the highest among men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is for those in their 50s, and the gap between men and women is only 90 years old.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 in males and 1.7 in females.
The exact reasons for this gender difference are not known, but it could be due to genetic and behavioral factors.
The gender-based immunological differences, the lower number of women smoking and the fact that men have congested diseases, such as hypertension, at an early age could have contributed to the higher mortality rate in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected people were men and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were men.
By April 2020, the U.S. Government is not tracking information on sex in COVID-19 virus infections.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARAG, affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, particularly nursing staff, are women, and have more opportunities for virus exposure.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to crown, VI to virus, D to disease and 19 to the date of discovery: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or group of persons, in accordance with international recommendations, is named to prevent stigmatization. The virus caused by COVID-19 is called acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in public communications.
It is common to use "coronavirus" to refer to both the disease and the virus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, it was common to refer to the virus and the disease as "coronavirus" and "coronavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and respiratory disease water for 2019-nCOV as temporary names for the virus and disease, according to the 2015 indication not to use locations in the name of viruses and diseases.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasal hyopes and respiratory parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respiratory valve and the provider could not deliver it at the required time, a local emerging company carried out reverse engineering and printed the 100 necessary valves during the night.
Following the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information and misinformation about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease that were rapidly spread over the Internet emerged.
It seems that humans can transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study did not find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks or chickens.
There are no approved medicines or vaccines to treat the disease.
Government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers are conducting international research on vaccines and medicinal products for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "Solidarity Test" to evaluate the therapeutic effects of the four most promising antiviral compounds in terms of effectiveness.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are actively developing possible vaccines.
The previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ECA2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, researchers seek to develop a complete virus vaccine.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to generate a rapid immune response from the human body to a new infection by the COVID-19 virus.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this study focuses on protein S that helps the virus to enter the ECA2 receptor.
A third strategy is the nuclear acid vaccines (ADN or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccines).
The experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should be studied to determine their safety and effectiveness. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers in Seattle began.
The vaccine contains an innocent copy of the genetic code of the virus causing the disease. It has been suggested that antibody-based improvement is a potential challenge for the development of vaccines against SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
By April 2020, there are more than 300 active clinical trials.
Seven studies evaluated treatments already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Re-adjusted antiviral drugs constitute most of China's research, including nine phase III trials on remedesivir in several countries and are to be reported by the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments on the vaccine and possible medicinal products against COVID-19 was under way. Several antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 were evaluated, including the following: remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.
In March 2020, there is evidence of attempted efficacy of remedesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with the compassionate use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, China and Italy. The chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020. The results were preliminary.
However, there are requests for peer review for the investigation.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, although Wuhan's Virology Institute recommends a daily dose of one gram, it points out that the double dose of Wuhan is very dangerous and could be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorisation for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating patients with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
More in vivo studies of nitazoxanide have been recommended following the determination that low concentrations inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial excretion of protein S that carries out type 2 transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ECA2 receptor.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have important limitations that prevent the medical community from taking these treatments without further studies. oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not have a known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
The release of cytokines may be a complication of the last stages of the COVID-19 severe.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine can have properties that prevent the release of cytokines. The National Health Commission of China included tocilizumab in treatment guidelines after completion of a small study.
It is in a national test not randomized in phase II in Italy after observing positive results in people with severe disease.
It is expected that, in combination with a blood analysis of serum ferritin to identify cytokine releases, you have counteracted these effects, which are believed to be the cause of death of some infected people.
The FDA approved the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on past cases for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome resistant to steroids induced by another cause, the treatment of T-Car T lymphocytes in 2017.
To date, there is no un randomized controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system from those who have recovered from COVID-19 to those who need them as a passive method of immunization without vaccines is being investigated.
This strategy was tested with the SRAG with unconcluding results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody treatment can defend against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive treatment with antibodies are being developed, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies.
The production of sulphur as a convalient, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased to achieve a faster distribution.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later died of COVID-19 after generating awareness about the spread of the virus.
