The main task of the kings was to build a tomb once, from which it was thought that it would seem as timeless as the stars over the sand of the time, in which otherwise everything slowed down. The planning of survival was more important than the life itself, which was only the way there. Wars led them to remember gloriously on the walls of this tombtime, in which the scenes were carved. Of course much was decorated, and in later times even battles were presented that had not taken place.
