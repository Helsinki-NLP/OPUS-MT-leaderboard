Obama received Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
However, the meeting should also address the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-State solution discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been strained for years.
Washington criticises the ongoing settlement of Israel and rejects Netanyahu's lack of will in the peace process.
The deal on the Iranian nuclear programme by Obama has further aggravated the relationship between the two.
In March Netanyahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republicans before the US Congress, which was partly regarded as affront to Obama.
The speech was not in agreement with Obama, and he had refused a meeting with reference to the upcoming election in Israel.
In an emergency, Professor said to have shot his girlfriend
In an emergency, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officers had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Within the house the officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was crossed on a white block: "I am so sorry, I wanted to do it backwards, I loved Amy and she was the only woman who ever loved me." This was according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who, in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds where he had, according to the police, shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10:18.
He said Lamb made the prison emergency ever after.
By the end of the day, there was another death: Lamb took life when the police threw him away.
One day after the shooting at the university, the students and teachers were forced to hide behind closed doors, the authorities were still trying to get a picture of what Lamb motivated.
The details published by the investigators on both sides of the state, as well as what students and employees who knew him said, helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his teaching.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal precedent.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people", with which he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, comprising 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies to problematic behaviour.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised the Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, told him that Lamm had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for permission for health reasons and said he had some health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's employment policy meant that the promotion that the Lamb had worked so hard would not provide him with an automatic guarantee of a career as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's idea."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After fleeing the campus, the police found Lamb's trail when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still in the driveway.
It wasn't immediately clear why lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started his work at the University in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He promoted teaching in the spring.
One of Lamb's long-term friends called him intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met together.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to play the guitar for a few years.
He was the woman's monster at the time.
All the girls suffocated there when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson capital of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
In the emergency, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no warrant from a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the backstein house, which was adjacent to a bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was okay.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said that they were separated 15 years ago, but friends remained and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," O'Steen said about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared on a summer-year market three years ago.
Later they played the gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weakly lit bar near Gautier, said that he had seen Lamb and Princess Night on the night of September 5th, for the last time, after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harmony game before a scenic audience.
There was no sign that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were just cleaning up and making fun of each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar programme and specialized in American natives and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and the Student Committee.
On Tuesday evening at the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people, including teachers, employees, students and members of the community, attended a Christmas Day celebration.
Schmidts Mrs. Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the mahnwacht, while the University Scholars "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" sang.
The teaching will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We are trying to move our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now say Lamb made the call after he shot Schmidt, and that Lamb in his emergency called Prentiss, though his wife, but there's no indication that they've ever married.
Toys R Us plans to set less workers for Christmas
Toys R Us says that there will not be as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toy and baby product dealer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it planned to set up 40,000 people in stores and sales centers throughout the country. In the Christmas season 2014, 45,000 workers were hired.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that this month it will begin with the application and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holiday itself is still away for months, the Christmas business is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire time workers to provide stores with employees who sell, send and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "Date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I noticed that the seat is empty next to me, and it will gradually be clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for a prominent documentary film "Back in Time".
The film begins, and it makes sense to me that I am a simulated thread and an arm length away from being with the princess of Wales at a date.
"Back in Time", a documentation about "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and the producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had premieres 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," said Spielberg, "unquestionably the biggest time travel film ever made."
"Back in Time" will be seen on VOD, DVD and in selected movies in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's reinforced military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" of the almost five years lasting conflict, and more weapons will only aggravate violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN Chief again calls on all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said a press conference Wednesday that he was planning to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, Great Britain and France - at the ministerial meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional authorities "make this situation insolvent."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they had demonstrated when reaching a nuclear deal with Iran in the face of the crisis in Syria.
8 Survey values that show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others have made him a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the top ranks in polls down, it has not (yet) worked.
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump to be leading in the two-digit area, and some start to ask themselves seriously what it means for the chances of appointing the real estate mogul.
Of course it's too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry's leadership was handed over to the rising Herman Cain, from which no one won even one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have fought in a general election.
But external groups such as Jeb Bushs Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's livelihoods and start letting their dollars flow to hit him.
Here are some current survey values that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity values have turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey of the Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positively.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers are held in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans had a good opinion of Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP voters GOP would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a survey of CNN/ORC last week, 67 percent of Republicans said that they would be either "satisfied" or "satisfied" if Trump were nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be "enraged" if he was the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "inspired" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next in matters of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Republican voters say that they would be "unsatisfied" or "enraged" if Jeb Bush, the favourite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
A majority of Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and political statements, 52 percent of the Irish voters tending to the Republicans believe that the real estate Mogul has the right temper for a president, says ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same figure applies in the first country of choice of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 per cent of the Republicans think that he has the personality for a commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to perform his office effectively, and almost six out of 10 independent say that his temper does not fit into the White House, says ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they set up their teachers' hats, Republican voters consider Trump real.
If asked who won the first GOP nomination, they say after a survey of CNN/ORC from last week four out of ten that Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since the time when four of ten in July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters in the past did not have the clearest crystal ball.
At that time in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination against only 28% for the final candidates in the middle of Romney.
However, it turns out that a variety of GOP voters view Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered for another candidate, Trump beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-thromp support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey of the Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump has generated the majority support.
He scored 13 points in front of Carly Fiorina, 14 points in front of Marco Rubio, 15 points in front of Walker, 19 points in front of Jeb Bush and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would pick up the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A small majority of Donald-Trump fans say they have formed their opinion.
A new survey of CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that just over half of the voters who support the Trump say they have given their votes firmly.
Of course a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say never to change the opinion.
46% said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
However, Trump's strongest competition at the time of the other externalists, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violent" in his election two months ago, immigration was a turning-and-fishing point in the public discourse in 2016.
Some are concerned that the bombastic expression of Trump will be removed from the Republican Party by the Spanish Americans and that the reorientation efforts will be damaged.
But after the new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six of the 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
As long as the immigration remains in the ramp light, Donald Trump will probably do it.
The frustration over the government climbs to new peaks.
In the meantime, Donald Trump and Ben Carson are about half of the support of Republican voters, especially due to their external status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday survey of ABC/Post, they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.
And they're also angry at Washington.
A survey of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated about the Republicans at the Congress, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "helloly angry".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas of Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive living room - overlooking the North Sea Watt.
In the street, a square meter costs 73,300 Euros.
"On Sylt, the offer of objects is naturally limited," says the study - so the high price.
A new study shows in which special positions a square metre costs most.
Of course, 18.70 Euros per square meter for a student offer in Munich are not really small.
Unlike Germany's top-dwelling north, however, one of the prices is like Peanuts.
The real estate service provider Angel & Völkers has published a list of the most exclusive German residences - with square meters prices in swirling heights.
There are sometimes several tens of thousands of euros zero - per square metre, well noted.
But good, who can do it...
By the way: Munich is not even at the top.
Champions League: Bayern Dream Start thanks to Müller and Goddess
Double torso in Piraeus: Bayern-Star Thomas Müller just has a run.
A happy hit by Thomas Müller opened the way for the FC Bayern to a earned 3:0 at the Olympics Piraeus - then he left.
A sovereign show of the Champions League season.
World champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have provided the FC Bayern with a dream start in the "Mission Mailland" in the Hexenquessel of Piraeus.
The team of Coach Pep Guardiola won her performance at the Champions League at the Greek Olympics record champion in a warm atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52./90.+2) and Götzes hit (89.) earned with 3:0 (0:0).
The 12th success in the series will be the first step towards finale on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where the Guardian finally wants to get the Henkelpott to Munich in the third run.
Müller received good help from Olympiacos-Torwart Roberto, who had a shot by the world champion thought to be a flake at his 28th meeting at the Champions League for Bayern Leadership.
"We won't underestimate them," said Bayern-Captain Philipp Lahm before the game at Karaikakis Stadium in front of 31.688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munichers kept their word.
They showed a concentrated and committed idea without glancing.
Piraeus had won his youngest six home games in the royal class, including against famous clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund also stood here (1:3).
But the Bavarians, in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They courageously went to work in their offensive efforts, but often to no avail.
The attacks were initiated too often by playing on the left-hand side of Douglas Costa, which rarely passed against the former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck on his right when his flange came in from the right half-field at the top left corner.
In the 67th minute, the world champion gave the possible 2:0.
The best opportunities in half were Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiacos stormer Ideye Brown hit the Polish head of the line (26.).
Then, by direct decrease, Torwart Roberto paired with the knee (35.).
Although the Bavarians used to take up a dominant game, Piraeus could put needle stick.
But Manuel Neuer was left on the tortoise.
For example, when he shot an ideaye over the latte (56.).
Before a new one, Guardiola had a four-chat with David Alabama at the center of Jerome Boateng, which did it well.
Mario God, after muscle problems back in the frame, first sat outside.
The WM light only gave green light after the final training, sports director Matthias Summer said at "Sky": "Whoever wants to do something else out of it is already evil."
Also in the first shift, Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the hit Lewandowski (59.).
God came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and made it clear 13 minutes later, by elfmeter, the müller put another on.
Before the game, it came to Krawalen in the stadium.
After a small group of partially supposed Bayern fans in their watch-block apparently provoked the supporters of hosts Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and went ahead with strikes against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bayern fan was transported from the stadium.
Anyone who smokes has a higher risk of losing teeth
Anyone who smokes does so not only damage the lungs, but also the teeth - this closes up a long-term study by a Potsdamer.
The good news: If you refuse, the risk will be reduced quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is reflected in the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research (DifE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, the risk of premature tooth loss in smokers was to increase the 2.5- to 3.6-fold level.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth loss are caries and inflammations of the tooth meat, the DifE emphasizes.
For this parodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors stress.
The relationship between smoking and tooth loss is therefore reduced to more frequent inflammation of the teeth in smokers.
It is not clear how much smoking also increases the risk of caries.
People who quit smoking but could reduce their risk within a short time, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take more than ten years until the danger decreases again to the level of non-smokers, says first author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham.
You had to convince people not to become smokers, heiner Boeing of the DifE explained: "Smoking shortens the life span."
Not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health until high age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by dentistry, DifE reported.
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study undermines the findings.
Archaeologists hit Cologne Rheininfer on the remains of the late antiques
Archaeological findings have been made at the right Rhine-Palatinate in Cologne.
Close to the building site for the new Rhine Boulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-German-Museum have dug up skeletons and remains of historical buildings, said Museum Manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work at the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called ground caves.
In all construction projects in the city district of Cologne, the museum is always added as a façade for Archaeological Groundenskmalförge.
In the third construction section of the Rhine Boulevard, archaeologists were now found.
It has already been known from text documents that in the place of a fortress in the 4th century and a church in the 8th century, Trier explained.
In addition to the rest of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with some 350 graves was discovered, which was probably part of the church.
Young woman from freight train
After a young woman at the railway station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern is injured, the Federal Police are asking the population for help.
On the early Wednesday morning at 1.40 p.m., the woman from the station building crossed the track at the end of the train path and was taken by a freight train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
By recording the train, she suffered the most serious injuries, according to the Federal Police.
She was treated on site for medical treatment and was taken to a hospital by rescue personnel.
No findings are available to the investigating officers on the grounds of the nightly cross-section of the young woman.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have experienced acoustic perceptions.
Inquiries include residents or passersby of Linderner Railway, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffartherstraße (L364).
Information on the cause of the accident may be provided by telephone 0800/6888000 or any other police station.
EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TTIP
In order to strengthen the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The contested private settlement facilities for disputes between groups and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system, which in its functioning corresponds to significantly more traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said in his presentation.
Sweden intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade negotiations with the United States.
The German government announced support.
Through TTIP, the largest free trade area in the world is to be created with 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitration procedure provide concretely for the EU and the US to select jointly independent judges for a new Investment Court.
They are intended to come from the EU, the USA and third countries in the same way.
For the first time, there is also a second instance.
It would allow it to challenge judgments.
So far, the parties to the proceedings have agreed on judges, and there was no objection to their judgments.
In the discussion of last month, it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old ISDS system in matters of fairness and justice, commented Malmström.
In the long term, it intends to work on an International Investment Court according to its own data.
For example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could also be clarified.
The investor state separation procedures (ISDS) required mainly by large groups are considered as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel litigation, through which companies can compete against taxpayers, enforce national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact referred to the EU Commission's proposals as insufficient.
In particular, it was criticised for not being applicable to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
The German Secretary of Economic Affairs Matthias Machnig (SPD) described the plans as major progress.
The Commission took into account the key points of the reform that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration is from the table.
The French government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.
The European BusinessEurope Association warned to limit the appeal possibilities of the economy through too many new rules.
In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged, it said.
When the negotiations on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be concluded, it was still unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been in progress since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States.
Originally, the framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year.
This date is no longer considered to be sustainable.
Delicate People of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens is sitting on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (now Luxor).
Next to him is a Flipchart on which the fearsome folk singer has recorded the picturesque state of Michigan with a felt pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost caught up in Steven's speech.
He tells on the basis of various places, which he has always recorded on the map, about which he reports his minutious and neatly arranged songs.
Where they were born and what it looked like in his home.
Since then, Stevens has proved to be a wonderful creative error.
With the 2003 release and the third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State", cleverly composed songs that are harmoniously close to the American people of the late 60s can be played in great opulent motion at any time.
The rumor is that "Michigan" would be the first part of a series of reasons: each of the 50 U.S. states is to be defeated as a result.
But in 2004 and near Rhineland, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and is breaking certain expectations.
Reduced Stevens will be here.
Live is enough for him guitar and Banjo.
A year later, the musician living in New York will return to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invitations You To: Come on Feel The Illinois") in 2005, it is a highly celebrated masterpiece.
Overcoming ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album ascends to the American Billboard Charts and is not available in any year's top list of influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then uses "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic spare parts.
This sixth regular studio album is still widely orchestrated, but is worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and halls.
Along with the smaller clubs, the stage shows here will be the colourful show of neon star bands and large fluorescent stage décor.
Sufjan Stevens is currently a member of a five-headed band in Germany.
In the dark held Hamburger More!
The theatre is mainly presenting the "Carrie & Lowell" available since March.
Although there are now nearly 2,000 guests who are banned in their chairs, the well-trained Stevens returns to intimacy and to the people.
Without referring a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians is playing through the widely-enriched album.
From the audience you can hear: The lecture is "opulent" and thus you can "remove the album basically".
Only one addition thanks to Stevens is modest, acoustically plays a few older songs and finally bows down under a thousand applause.
Jeremy Corby's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr. Corby's Debüt is expected to be excited at the Prime Minister's Question Time
The new Labour President Jeremy Corbyn is due to give his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and meet David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will be raised to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, with his performance likely being checked by the media and the Labour MEPs coming close.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings in order to leave them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corby's leadership, as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cabinet and after his speech at the TUC Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labour president to insist on silence at a 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain on Tuesday during the national anthem song provoked criticism from a number of Tory-MPs and stands at the centre of several headline stories in the newspapers.
Mr. Corby's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention to himself
One speaker from Mr. Corbyn said he would have "stand still" and recognized the "Heldendom of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England".
But a member of Mr. Corby's Shadow Cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program that he had asked the Labour President to sing the national anthem "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Corby's top team, and they relied on differences in the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party initially supported him as leader.
The BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also "stumbled" within Labour, according to Mr. Corby's statements on the position of the European Union and the restriction on profits.
Mr. Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour is changing to remove the whole idea of a total restriction.
Hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadow-work and pension minister, said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government's plans to reduce the limit of £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour President, who has been facing David Cameron, since he is the Tory Chief, over the Dispatch Box in Parliament for the past decade.
The Labour President, who has promised another policy statement, says that he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Hour is too confrontational and that he will be left behind both "fighting" and the fight against reprisals and has taken the place instead to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow minister, would represent him if he did not take part - for example when Mr Cameron is on his way abroad.
He also discussed the idea that other colleagues would occasionally use the word, and that he had addressed John Bercow, the speaker of the House, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to get away from politics in the style of a "kasperle theater", which is often linked to the Prime Minister's question hour. But a few years later he admitted that he had failed.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, the Question Time with the Prime Minister was seen as the most important barometer of a leader's judgment and leadership in the underground and his position under his fellow parliamentarians, although critics have argued that they have become a cartoon and need far-reaching reforms.
'Shoots in Joburg': Unobtrusive young people trained to photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a bustling place when you are homeless.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and thus earn the livelihood.
"I what shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a useful studio that teaches homeless young people how to take photos of their surroundings and gain a profit from it.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound increases due to accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound rose rapidly to data showing an increase in UK wage growth. In parallel, the FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller target.
Between May and July, the result without any bonus in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% compared to the same period of the previous year.
This percentage has been the fastest and most estimate since 2009 at the time of an increase in interest rates.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505 and was up to 0.84% against the euro to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index was increased by 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a jump of 20% after the takeover offer of the rival AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budwieser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares, according to encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Richemont was 0.9% higher.
Richemont's latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - again reported growth.
Glencore shares increased by 5% after the mining company said that it had received $2.5 billion as part of its debt reduction strategy through a share sale.
The shares of Mondi's packaging and paper group were the biggest losers on the index, with a decrease of 4.3% after Goldman Sachs put his estimate for the company Rating on sale.
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sports clothing company reported a preliminary tax profit of 46.6 million for the year.
The head of JD Sports says higher wages are at risk of expansion.
JD Sports Manager Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of its company, he says.
The costs could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and this could mean that there are less additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On the Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lippie 21-year-old, a handkerchief with overcrowded hair.
The type with the flat blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy.
Even more.
Currently, Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin.
And the U17 generation is going through.
Like Victoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard of the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans escorted Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Victoria from Poland.
Since 7 a.m., however, the Polish has been sitting on the cold stone plates for Berliner Luxushotel at Potsdamer Square.
The Bieber-Build: Here you live her idol, whose posters have been hanging in Stettin since Monday night.
The suite in which the Canadian singer lives costs exactly as much as her mother Ewa earns in half a year.
If at all.
She says, "Oh, actually, my Victoria had to sit in the tenth grade in high school."
"I'll fill her with a dream."
Guilty?
Who's kidding?
The fans don't.
Not even Bieber himself.
It's been provided anyway.
For the advertisements in the Super Bowl's advertising break, he cashed out three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pixel firm washed out many, many dollars on the Bieber account.
And with every doll that looks like him and goes over the laden table, Bieber also cancels.
If Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you stand on the window board.
More than 100 million are supposed to have taken advantage of it.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others point out that Bieber was finally in the United States and Great Britain with his new single "What do you mean?" in place 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album will follow in November, the many zeros are not interested for the first time.
At least he does.
Pegida poster brings Lebanese on potato tones idea
Potatoes or dolls?
It's both in the potato  toner developed by the Oldenburger Imbisowner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the phrase "Cartoffel instead of Doner" on a poster of the Pegida movement Alhay put potatoes and meat together on a spear.
On the idea, a poster was brought to him at a Pegida demonstration with the label "Cartoffs instead of Doner", which he had accidentally seen on television.
Since then, a grilled spatter has been turned into his shop, which is packed with meat and potatoes.
"That's multiculture for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has now been introduced by the Lebanese Patent Office in Munich.
It has recently been protected as a pattern of use, according to the Authority.
Therefore, how much meat and how much potatoes of the spear contain, Alhay does not want to betray.
Just so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
Also with its customers, the culinary understanding of the peoples comes well.
Metcash launches Soil Independence Campaign to Combat Aldi Incident
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA branches from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a land independence campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing for the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media, as well as through events such as Adelaide Show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as icemaker Simmo from Dunsborough, which distributes samples in IGA stores and owners, the agreed tickets for the South Australian Footballliga to faithful customers.
It is expected that Metcash will publish further details of its defence strategy on 29 September when the wholesaler carries out his annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Metcash's IGA store and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the East States.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in Eastern States.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will be removed about five percent of the food market in these two countries 12 months after opening its first markets and will remove all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million revenue per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and will achieve a sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and food business and the amounts on Metcash's high fixed cost basis could cost Metcash about $13 million in interest and tax profits, Mr. Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses market shares in the eastern states, mainly Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most trusted.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's turnover in the food and food business will fall by 3.8% in 2016, by 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, and the market share will fall from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglas, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told a business in Melbourne that Metcash would probably disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to respond to Mr. Douglas' comments in public.
But it is assumed that a board member of Metcash contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
IGA's market share has dropped from 18 percent since 2010 to 14 percent, and revenues from Metcash's food and food trade, which provides some 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational debt reduction at the same time pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler resists and invests more than $150 million in order to adjust sales prices with Coles and Woolworths in hundreds of products every week and to improve IGA retailers in their stores through faster growing fresh foods and to provide a better selection of private label foods.
Metcash's chief businessman, Ian Morrice, says that the price adjustments and charging programs will be added to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the president of the Australian tennis team, Steve Healy deserves more praise than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, which is always referred to as "Special Ks", runs into the ramp light through the notorious confrontation of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualification game in Cincinnati soon Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the judge, and Harrison exclaimed: "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgyz, and I should have beaten the child."
While he was last seen beating down a tennis player after a battle struck a potential U.S. open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis of Healy was constantly defended.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the second place in the single behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinal against the United Kingdom.
"One thing that I'm quite worried about is the fact that in my opinion Thanasi was a little involved in the dispute," Healy said.
He broke a battle when he lost due to a battle in the U.S. Open, but he is not the first player to break a battle out of hunger with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the U.S. opening, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little too tight.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the changing area, he is trained hard, he is good in shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account in the important pre-decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right one for all, but he assures the man from Canberra to return as a long-term fixed component to the team."
"At first we wish that the team was completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick has managed to get up very quickly, which people like Federer and Murray have pointed to. He rises in the public eye, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions. Some time outside the disaster light in which he can only think of it, I think it is appropriate, and it is best for the team and it is the best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and seized the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to illegally enter the country. All with a view to stopping the flow of migrants.
Chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a non-human country and Serbian officials responded with excitement.
The people who had fled from violence stood on the road between the two checkpoints of the country and built tents and lay there for an unknown time.
But frustrations are on the rise.
When a police helicopter slammed over them, the migrants scanned "Open the border!" and shouted insults against the Hungarian readiness police.
Some showed off from protest food and water.
Serbia's foreign minister said it was "unacceptable", that migrants would be returned from Hungary, while more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) will be part of the solution and not a side effect.
Talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulence at the Hungarian-Serbian border could not agree on a common immigration policy one day after the 28-nation bloc in Brussels.
However, ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the surrounded Italy and Greece, and they expressed their hope that - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would finally be reached that the EU countries would accommodate another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a European Union special summit on Tuesday to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
However, Hungary did not focus its hopes on a prompt action by Brussels or its neighbours.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, so that they could block the streets and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szyjjarto said, however, that his country also plans to build a stable fence along its border to Romania to stop the flow of migrants across the country - after it has ended a fence at the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison satins were used in the race to create the Stacheldhart Zaun between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major hub for many refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and the point of entry into the European Union.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most of the incoming economic refugees are looking for a better life, not for war refugees who have the right to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make crossing the border or damaging the 4-metre (13 foot) high fence that the government had built along the southern border to Serbia a crime. These laws also impose higher prison sentences for convicted human traffickers.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency," said government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: illegal cross-border is a crime.
Parliament still has to agree to the use of the military, which is expected for next week, but reporters of Associated Press have seen heavy-armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, National Security Adviser for Orban, said that authorities had 45 people in an attempt to cross the border, 15 others were already deeper into the country.
They come across by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody, and they are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are trying to repair the tooth quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning, after a train ride with a stacked wire to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and press a lot of people to enter.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked Serbia and Hungary's main highway connection and said that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election-2016: Hillary Clinton's lead before Bernie Sanders in national survey
Former U.S. Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to have a two-digit lead in the democratic race to nominate at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins it against the floor.
Clinton now has 47 per cent support for democratic voters in the elections (58 per cent previously), while Sanders is in second place, with 27 per cent (an increase of 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is running for the presidency, receives 15 percent of the democratic electorate's support.
More than five months before the elections began, most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more stable in their choice than the other candidates.
Since the CBS-News survey, Clinton has lost some of the demographic groups, while Sanders has gained some profits.
Clinton has a great lead in women and women who have been reduced, but these advances have decreased.
Their support for men is clearly reduced, and Sanders is only 5 points behind.
Clinton's advantage of democratic voters under 50 has accelerated, and they and Sanders are now at the same height.
Clinton, however, still has a great lead in older voters.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders with a two-digit lead for the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead for this group.
About half of the democratic voters of the elections say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party.
One quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would support them only because she is the candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support them.
Maybe it's not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are especially excited by her.
The views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would support it.
While 48 percent of the democratic voters say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidates Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Approval to deal with problems and selectivity is also cited.
As the Vice-President throws a potential for the President's office, 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not.
When democratic voters of the elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party, prayer is at the top.
Clinton's supporters say more than half that Biden's second choice was far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the nomination of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton's preference for Sanders is increased from 20 points with bids in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win the election; however, this number has fallen by 78 percent last month.
Biden is a second in this measurement at a distance, but the percentage that sees him as the "choicest" has risen.
However, when it comes to the question of what is more important for a candidate, democratic voters call questions about the eligibility.
Like last month, there is no democratic candidate or potential candidate for this electorate as unacceptable.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results in some important features for voters of their party's elections.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden cuts off the three candidates best at honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, so many say so much about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.
Democratic voters of the elections generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server continue to be asked as a foreign minister during the term of office, most democratic voters of the elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions at all.
But it's another story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about a third are satisfied.
The public opinion on this was divided in March shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no impact on their general opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent said that their opinion had worsened.
They are mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton's voters are considered to be honest and trustworthy, this is still a problem for them as a whole among registered voters: only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, 8 percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May.
62% of the electorate do not consider them to be an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of the elected nationwide see Trump as not honest and untrustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump get good grades when they run.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush cut off the best in honesty.
A majority looks more like honest Sanders, but like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 democratic voters in the elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson stands up for a nationwide survey close behind Donald Trump
Ben Carson is in the latest survey of CBS News/New York Times close behind Donald Trump
On the two candidates, half of the voter's support in the new survey is now reflected, and others lose dramatically
Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers throughout the country. Support is growing by 23% in the last CBS survey conducted before the Fox News debate last month, by 27% in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson shot 6% at 23% during the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson is good at demographic groups and exceeds Trump among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been hit by Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen to the deepest, from 10% last month's support to 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are 6% in the third place.
The error margin for the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this recent survey is plus or minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey, published last week, shows that Carson is increasing in polls - it has 19% support for the Republicans, after the 32% support for the Trump.
The latest survey of ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly in front of Carson.
Looking at a carson rising last week, Trump found some side effects for the former neurosurgeons, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump's beliefs.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign show in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even if peak values are measured only in the distance, there is already a trip to the Mediterranean to find still warm water for bathing vacationers.
A bath in the North or East Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some people don't go to sea anymore: Maximum 18 degrees has the water in the North and East lake this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) shares.
However, bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean: in the east they reach up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Five members of the fraternity charged with the death of a Baruch College-newling
Nearly two years after a student died during a scrupulous ritual of a student association in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.
Members of the New Yorker Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introduction ritual in September 2013 brutally and delayed his transportation to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police informed him.
Officials said he was loaded with eyes connected with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and was repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a goal over a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi-Delta-Psi fraternity did not call for the 911 call after Deng became powerless and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital, the police said.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothing, to google his symptoms, and Andy Meng to contact the nation's presidents of the brotherhood to gather the council, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide Utensilsils and put the welfare of the brotherhood in principle above that of Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
He couldn't be reincarnated, and he died the next morning of his injuries.
After an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly added with stupendous force injuries to the head, rumps and upper joints.
"To many families they have been destroyed by the Shikans of the Brotherhood. At least one student has died every year since 1970 at the Shikans," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Dengs family, in a statement.
Brothers and their members must be taken into account, and this is a very important step by the authorities.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a third degree charge for murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also charged with shameful attacks and the formation of a criminal association.
"Not only do we want to hold the parties responsible, but if there is an organization that - officially or informally - has sanctioned this, we will also take it into account," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has revoked its membership of the local group.
This will happen when the Fed increases interest
There is an increase in interest, and the house will be awakened, interest on loans will rise, and the economy will rise to a recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it will last and how long it will last.
In particular, the history of the economy offers little guidance for the course.
A recession occurred within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, although not always, a factor in how the economy and financial facilities react.
Therefore, representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on increasing interest rates when they start, but rather on the period needed for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
However, at the end of the day, market participants might find that the entire excitement may have been exaggerated due to an increase in interest.
"The first increase in Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of "cheap money", said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal heights, but still at a low level to lead to the seismic shock, which many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here is a historical trend-based view of how some areas of the economy could react:
As the market has seen last month, the prevention of interest increases can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency to reject assets 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy again," Deutsche-Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after interest increases of the fed.
More precisely, in the past 35 years, the market is mostly on the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to increase interest, rather flatly in the 250 days after (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the past six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a current analysis published by Bob Doll, Head of Investment Strategy at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
The Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the return begins to decrease.
Regressions are a fact of economic life, but increases in interest often promote them.
In the present case, the Fed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate a recession.
It is particularly noteworthy that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point at an increase in FD.
According to Deutsche Bank, nominal GDP has been below 4.5 per cent at the 118 interest increases since 1950.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, only a few expect this to take place and only 1.5 percent expect for the third quarter according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest increases in such a fragile economic climate could be risky and raise the question, "Is it different this time," the Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been attracted to an increase in Fed throughout the year, and all eyes were directed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategies and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, the future trade only gives a 25 per cent probability.
"In our study, all increase cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing fluctuations in GDP and pre-regression heights very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows," the report said.
In contrast, this is a clear slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is the longest that the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this has been 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile, as the market is forecasting an increase in interest, and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on loans is faster than on shares when they change their strategic course.
In the case of loans, the returns seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase/decrease occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the borrowers fell immediately, the Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab's strategies believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a closer relationship between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a smoothing of the curve.
High-level loans often bring better returns in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher returns," said Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the outlook for stricter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the yield curve is flater, credit tensions have expanded and volatility has increased - all market features when the Fed tightens its strategy.
In general, companies that deal with most of their business in the United States will benefit from increasing interest rates and becoming more attractive to local products.
Multinational companies with high debt will suffer worse as an increasing dollar makes their products on the global market more expensive and also the financing of their debts.
"The story shows that "quality" shares tend to react too positively three months after an initial increase in interest," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a customer report.
Firms with a strong balance sheet have on average exceeded 5 percentage points after each of the increases in interest rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low-quality entrants by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debts are going to be a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most, Goldman said.
Outside the pure share games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savings could see profits through higher earnings, even if experts are of different opinion how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticised the broadcaster for his "duty"
He argues that he is not different from commercial rivals.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated The Brits
Parliament's colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice and said it wasn't very original.
BBC Radio 3 "turns" to Classic FM, claims a leading member of parliament and raises new pressure on the broadcaster to prove that he is doing something that private broadcasters do not do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC bosses that the public-law radio broadcaster is "debt" and is increasingly no longer different from his commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "damn" - but it seems to turn to Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, appear to be only under another name.
So if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples, in which you actually only imitate what is already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The BBC Director General rejected the proposals and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public disclosure.
What I learn from Radio 3, I'm going to learn about classical music nowhere else.
And there is an engagement for live music and music that is truly unsurpassed.
"And the commitment of Radio 3, to find new music and to order new works, I also really consider important," he said.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that more hard work should be done to engage the public than in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3 was not, however, the only element of BBC production, which, during the hearing in the Committee on the Selection of Culture, Media and Sport, led to the fire of the commercial rivals.
The Tory Deputy Damien Collins seized The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show purchased by the Dutch Talpa Media producer for estimated costs of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly marked?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced "on special BBC ways".
He added that he wished the company to find "a hit from our own house" when it next started a series of interviews.
However, he refused to rule out the order of further series of The Voice in the future or to pay the fees for other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales increase in August at the slowest and the Black Friday can be responsible for it
In the first three months of 2015, there were seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of the 2000 recording
Online sales increased three years ago by using phones for purchase
Experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slowed down the expenditure
For over a decade, virtual shopping has been booming, and many of the UK's main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there is now a sign that online sales are stagnant after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August presented the lowest growth in growth since the beginning of the 2000 censuses with only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales stagnate after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, then it has always evolved over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started to shop with their phones.
It meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different settings, for example at home on the sofa.
But now this is growing, and we may experience that growth is decreasing.
The Black-Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the lagging sales.
Experts believe that buyers withhold their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers cut their computer to make their snacks, and some dealer websites collapsed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where buyers fought for bribes, could prevent buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that £5 spending was spent a little more than £1 online.
For some products such as TV and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now made via web-shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca in the Kran accident - Bin Ladens family is being punished
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funerals in Mecca by the streets
Saudi Arabia partially puts the collapse of the huge Saudi bin-load group to the load
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after crashing the crane
Hundreds of Muslims gathered as 29 victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane hit Mecca's Grand Mosque.
Griefs filled the line, mostly dressed in white, to pay their respects when the first of the dead entered their last trip to the Al-Moassem cemetery.
The mourning procession passed at the Holy Place, where only days before a bakery was thrown through the ceiling of the mosque and then upon the bones.
The bodies were released for liberation when the Saudi king imposed a penalty on the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 better people who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Great Manchester, father of four children who were on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual haddsch in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already said that the Haddsch to Mecca will continue with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today King Salman said that the bin-store group should not have left the arm of the crane when it was not used.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the state Saudi Press Agency, said that the binload group was co-responsible for the collapse.
The English language service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the company's leadership was prohibited from travelling abroad.
Early this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the collapse of the crane, which broke into a courtyard of the Great Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before Haddsch, which later took place this month.
The Bin-Laden Group has not issued any statements on the collapse of the Krans and its representatives have not been available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also punished the group for non-current security measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
dozens of cranes surround Mecca's Grand Mosque as part of the massive construction project run by the Bin-Load Group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi family for decades and is undertaking larger construction projects.
The deceased leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a distraught son who was adopted by the family in the 1990s.
The collapse of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rains, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is needed at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital.
Government representatives ordered that 1 million Rial (£ 174,000) be paid to the members of the victims and the same amount to the permanent injured.
Other victims receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European artisans is over
Britain is working increasingly handicrafts, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled artisans from Eastern Europe has increased behind
This leads to the opening of 200 additional Screwfix stores targeting artisans
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q sales outlets across the country
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of Daily Mail
It is claimed that Britain is lowering its barriers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European artisans who carry out the work at home
If you can walk around with a hammer or a brush to reach walls, today you seem to belong to a minority.
Because Britain is increasingly engaged in handicrafts to carry out domestic jobs in their homes, so the head of the company behind the B&Q.
Véronique Laury, new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the construction chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled artisans from Eastern Europe, the services offered at low prices had now been overrun.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix Shops, which are aimed at artisans and close 60 sales outlets of B&Q.
Mrs. Laury said she wants to employ more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten shopping decisions are made by women.
At the moment, men are among the employees.
She said that it is necessary to put on the growing demographic trends, which have more female single budgets, which are making more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said, "There's still a majority of men working in our branches.
We need to move this further to a balance.
In principle, half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of products by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a leading company listed in the FTSE100 Index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has had exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and financial management.
Mrs. Laury said, "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher reported a decrease in half-yearly profits and revenues after the group shouldered the costs of closing the warehouses.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Officials of Aich/Dob because of mistrust before court
On Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Vice-President Aich/Dob have to take responsibility for their distrust and tax evasion.
The defendants were not found guilty.
One of them was also accused of abuse of office.
From this draft, he was legally acquitted in May.
The current process has been postponed.
According to Supreme State Attorney Robert Riffel, the preliminary investigation showed that the defendants used funds from association accounts that they were allowed to dispose of in their functions for private purposes during the years 2006 to 2011.
He mentions the damage with about 400,000 euros.
Sports officials are also accused of financial misconduct.
This fact separated the president of the creation Senate, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It shall be negotiated at a later date.
In the event of the rejection of the distrust, the defence stated that the association had not at any time created an asset disadvantage.
The sports officials had only calculated the expense damage and the sports club for which they had worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money had been released from debt - the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 shillings in 2001 (EUR 44,000).
"At that time we were faced with the situation: Are we going to continue or block the club?" said one of the accused, in the bread business inspector of the Financial Office.
With his colleague and co-accused, he then decided to take up this task.
With all the risks.
"We have invested money, placed our life assurances as collateral with the bank," he said in the agreement.
It was agreed with the association: you can freely manage the money, it must only be done with no guilt.
In addition, in the case of financial success, the payment of the cost damages has been decided retroactively by 1991.
Therefore, some of the damage incurred was paid out only years later, namely from 2003, when a plus was on the account.
Therefore, even pauschal and not detailed offers appeared, the former obese explained the proceedings.
The accounts and savings books managed the two accused together, the second accused said.
The judge asked why the payments to the association were not disclosed in detail.
The association did not have an interest in the details of the financial contribution, which was important only if the debt was free, so the answer.
When an official investigation of abuse began in 2011, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the association account.
The defendants explained that this has been the case.
This security account was in the name of the second defendant and was, according to his statement, unknown to the association.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
The question was not answered for a long time.
Then he finally thought that this was the best thing for the association.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known anything about this money, the prosecutor put it in.
If the defendant had been informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as "disposal".
Why did you want to know about the damage done to the judge and the attorney?
The first defendant then stated that he had not agreed to this formulation because the association had never been damaged.
But what should I do when the lawyer says, "You're all from the tailor."
"Am I a lawyer?" he asked.
In addition, the official said that he had never made a cent salary, he calculated only kilometer money and diets.
On diets, he took into account the association of 1,000 euros per month, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.
The defendants were unable to produce precise documents for the early years.
These were no longer stored after an operational examination in which everything was judged to be correct, they explained.
Kilometer money had also been given to the second defendant.
All the repairs were in the bar and he had to drive from his residence to the bank to Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main debate will continue on 23 September with the examination of witnesses.
Hewlett Packard manages 30,000 more jobs
In addition to the downturn in staff for three years, the computer crisis will reduce further jobs when the company is split up.
The strike at the U.S. computer giant Hewlett Packard (HP) won't find an end.
As part of its restructuring, the US technology group plans to cut down from 25,000 to 30,000 seats in its corporate party.
As a result, the company announced costs of $2.7 billion (EUR 2.4 billion) on Tuesday.
The step will lead to a special load of about 2.7 billion dollars, which will come from the fourth quarter.
The construction of 55,000 jobs that has been in progress for three years has not yet been completed.
HP employed about 302,000 employees at the end of the financial year 2013/14.
Subsequently, the Hewlett Packard share remained 2.3 percent.
The Californian Palo Alto group, which is grown up with printers, is currently divided into: This is how the computer and printer business is to be merged into a new society today - separate from the more promising areas of computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange.
A once again disappointing PC rate and a weaker demand from company customers for its services have recently added to the world's second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo.
In the third business quarter at the end of July, the paragraph of PC and printers decreased by 11.5 percent.
Turnover fell by 8 per cent to nearly 25.4 billion dollars.
Thus, the redemptions went back in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP is responding to the change in the industry with a break-up and massive job strains.
The 76-year-old company, led by Meg Whitman, has only recently reacted to the fact that customers are increasing the purchase of smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and are increasingly doing more and more business online.
Whitman's restructuring plans provide a total of 55,000 seats.
Conflicts: Most support the anti-IS training mission
However, a direct participation of German soldiers in fighting in Iraq would be largely rejected: 54 percent said no, 35 percent agreed.
The fact that other states are flying air attacks against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive.
24%, however, are to intervene in the conflict.
Cooperation with the Syrian ruler Baschar al-Assad denied 51 per cent of the respondents, 20 per cent for this.
29% could not decide.
Car: Second press day on the 66th IAA
At the centre of the fair are connected, self-propelled cars and electrical mobility until 27 September.
After two press days, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Car Exhibition under the motto "Mobility Connects" on Thursday.
The wide audience can visit the IAA of Saturday.
The organizers of the VDA Auto-Association count as two years ago with about 900 000 visitors.
Röszke: Violation of Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have employed several hundred displaced refugees at the Serbian border at Röszke Tränegas and water wells.
Euronews correspondent Daniel Bozsik has moderated the outbreak of violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported on the phone:
A group of refugees crossed the border.
After that, a police station was formed and a water station was ready behind the police station.
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones, pieces and plastic bottles at the officers.
The officers first used uninterrupted pepper spray.
Then the police used tear gas.
Many tear gas has been sprayed towards the refugees.
This led to the dissolution of the group.
The refugees have now withdrawn a little.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the area.
Children who had breathed the tear gas cry.
Other refugees slammed together and left under breath.
The Serbian police press spokesmen also suffered injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the US notary bank
The world is watching when the U.S. notary bank comes together on Wednesday and Thursday to make the important decision whether or not interest will be raised for the first time for almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half the last week was the view that the Fed would do this, now thinks that the Fed will continue for a little longer and that the interest rates will be maintained at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Fed put interest on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Head of Staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is at a relatively good level of performance, billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a small inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy view of global conditions.
It has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the signs indicate that the chances against such a step are good.
The decision will be announced at 2 p.m. on Thursday
Mortgage at Delta State University left letters of apology
After the shooting and killing of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues the day later - Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying that it "pained" him in the first murder and wanted to "make it unseemly," authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, lecturer for geography and social science education at the Delta State University, called the emergency number at 10:00 a.m. on Monday morning
and said, 'He has shot some man, and killed some.'
Lamb told the emergency staff that the police had to send police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that there was a "sweet dog" in the house, but that "no one will bother", but he'll probably be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give it.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When the police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note of Lamb, 45, who said: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to make it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note Lamb 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday evening as a police officer to round him up.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's idea."
Despite reports on Monday, the Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that there is "no information, no evidence" for a "triangular relationship".
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said that they had been married for about seven years as a "good man".
The two were separated 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who was 19, and she was "damaged on the ground".
He said that Prentiss' daughter was "absolutely best friends".
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowledges, which was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog named Lightning, had met Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles.
The police said Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them, "He doesn't go to prison".
When the police picked him up on Highway 1 near Greenville later this night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled to the foot, went into the woods and killed himself with a gun.
Lamb received a doctoral degree from the Delta State University in spring 2015, as his lifetime on the University's website indicates.
Stars That Lost Their Lucky Bringers
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought leukaemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-term partner, Farrah Fawcett, for cancer.
The actor is also supposed to have to fight drugs, and in 2008 he was sentenced for possession of drugs.
All of this certainly calls for his Tribute.
Eurowings: Lufthansa is building the group
The Lufthansa is planning a large group building.
Half a billion euros a year, the Lufthansa Group wants to save itself with a better organisation.
150 of the around 1000 leaders around the world will cost the group building the workplace.
There are no new negotiations with the pilot trade union.
The Lufthansa rebuilds its corporate structure and evaluates the Eurowings.
The aim of the reorientation was to contribute about EUR 500 million per year from cost and rescue synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, there will be no board of directors at Lufthansa for passenger business in the future.
The cheap airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
In future, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings.
The re-arrangement underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to join Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
To date, the organization of 120,000 employees was a complex company.
The airlines signed under the roof of the Passage Airlines Group, which accounts for three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the tariff conflict with the driver association Cockpit (VC), the negotiations will be resumed after the judicial strike stopped on Thursday.
That's what the union said.
The topic of the conversation should be the rest arrangements for pilots.
Cockpit wants to come up with "in one year with a forecasted record result" as quickly as possible with viable results.
The conflict between trade unions and airlines has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional provision of the pilots, the concept of "Wings" is limited.
It provides that in the fight against competitors, the Lufthansa disposes of the Group's Eurowings billiline.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can't play for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw suffers a double fracture of his right leg at the Manchester Champions League at the PSV Eindhoven.
While this brought the left external defender to the wine and will exclude him for at least six months from the game, Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw can play again in this season.
The injury was caused by an unprecedented attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated nine minutes on the playground and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double bone fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be moved tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18, it's very hard and then plays fantasticly, and then it happens.
In the dressing room he had an oxygen mask.
He's crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then it takes six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to escape a red card and the hanging of an elfmeter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the judge, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian arbitrator had been wrong.
They can judge for themselves when I say that an elfmeter and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account said, "I thank you all for your news. Words can't describe how bad I am, my path to recovery starts now, I come back more strongly."
Referred to this: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat of the PSV
The English defender with the European Championship in France has an additional incentive to recover until next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, "It's a very bad injury."
If a player with this kind of injury leaves the space, all are very sad about it.
It's never our player's intention to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a bone fracture when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland team at the WM 2014.
"It is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent, and if you hear that it is a very bad injury, that is not good," Cocu said.
It wasn't possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was on its way in another direction, so it looked as if he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In the conversation with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult it can be.
I feel really bad about it.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also brought to the hospital - after a crazy game by Chris Smalling.
Are you sure David Cameron The Lorax knows better?
It is a thing that all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it will not take long for you to know it almost externally.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister for The Lorax, Dr. Seuss's environmental fable, published in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the SuperCamps website, and continues: " fun, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I like to read to my children, because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we've missed so far."
Everything is beautiful and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron supposedly describes the action of the book, instead reflects an indication of the content of the 2012 film version, added new characters and details to extend the rather short original text.
"In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a young man named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," he reads. A loving interest was Dr. Seuss, whose true name Theodor Seuss Gessel sounded and died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if it wasn't suspicious enough: the text presented by Cameron reads in part as the summary of the Lorax film presented on the website of the Internet Movie Database and begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the book’s actions. Here a nameless boy, like the local environment through the greedy, fallen trees, thneed-strinking Once-ler despite the protests of the renowned Lorax, a shocking, narrow-haired being, "who speaks in the name of the trees", is destroyed.
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times behind a child.
A Downing Street speaker said that the text probably came from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text of Cameron's employees was delivered, but did not give any further direct comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England's team, but it is still difficult
To hit Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but when you see the frame chosen by England for the tour, a repetition of the 3-0 test series is not on my map.
I wouldn't exclude an external match.
Alastair Cook's page is probably less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin players in the Batting show, and the community spirit is strong; they will not wear scars of 2012, only a youth-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin-bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it represents an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
Message related to this: Adam Lyth leaves the England test framework and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is, of course, difficult for me as his chief coach in Yorkshire to analyze.
In his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no questions at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, because - and I said this before - players are their own best voters.
Long ago you would have extended the course of Lyth, but he had control over his own fate.
If he's hoping to find out more runs for Yorkshire, there's another chance.
England's coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he didn't do so well, and that doesn't surprise me; he's above all a team man.
The question of how long a test hit man gets to put his signs is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and outside.
The only proposition that can be raised was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - as Lyth was in the highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming in, and he's a beat man I appreciate very much.
He is an X-factor cricket player, what we saw early in Yorkshire this season when he achieved 236 against us on a Trent Bridge square, which hit us very hard.
He must have at least the same chances as those before him, but of course this depends on the team composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea to beat Moeen next to Cook, which would bring an extra spin-bowler and get four quicks, turned up, and I don't mind.
I don't see why a beat man can't hit there, and this left hand has already shown that he's a devil's bet of cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number 3 for her, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs immediately and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the frame as a back-up spinner, and in my limited treatment with him he impressed me very much as a young man.
People may look at their statistics - on average 31 with the hammer and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there are not a large number of backup spins that raise their hands and the trainers have decided for young people.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made a few smart additions to the training staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lankan Batsman, as a test player could be a master's team.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game, which will bring a lot of experiences, as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white bullet phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use to the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or coach, and as Mahela he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the changing cabin can bring fresh wind, even if the news is in line with the previous statement.
Collis teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used in the One-Dayers, Root got a similar break against Australia and I don't have a problem with it for my part.
Some will not agree, but coaches and teambuilders do not set the timetable.
And you have to think that how players work depends on the results.
Such decisions are not made with light hearts.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = UK exit from the EU) could win at a discount if the economy hits a flood by 2017
David Cameron's undiminished renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is becoming more difficult every day, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn as the leader of Labour or the TUC, who is deeply devastated because of Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbys and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some Member States, as deep as the EU is now and not always due to their own guilt, have set up an agenda with split consents and disruptive treaty changes that they do not want to mostly.
In Brighton, at its annual meeting, the TUC decided that it does not like them if they are in danger of social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie Agenda.
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants a Britain looking beyond the EU's borders - "Let's not alone with France," says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short-term ministers and officials have come to the point where they don't care whether we stay or go.
Germany's cautious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she's been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as it has happened to the excessive long-term survivors such as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Coal (16).
France's François Hollande looks at his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's also a stunning force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain a left.
It is difficult to imagine that they will stretch a leg to help the selfie Brits, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's exit from the UK - something they do not want because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
For this reason, some of these ministers may even deliberately plan non-helpful remarks, all in the SNP style, while Britain's 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process is probably my friend.
"The renegotiation was a plea" and "Great Britain has won nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how devastating the Fleet Street can be at their expense and what EU skeptics are the Oligarchy of the Pressebarone, as they were not, during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can easily recall Boris Johnson, the Erz-Euro opportunist, who made himself a name as an "EU-Gerde-Banana" Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
In all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of tax-freaking hookers, telephone-hacking foreigners and the pseudo non-residents who own most of our big newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similar about her, but found that if you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage, you'd better distribute bananas to get rid of it instead of going to his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself, when he opposed Cameron's referendum, because Blair had laid down the principle of the unadopted EU constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door to him.
The press never told him that.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly slap on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him he didn't need any more time for me - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnocks Boycott Murdoch's strategy of the 1980s, a mistake then and today.
It can take time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corby's official position on Europe - I express it in a kind way - is in development.
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukips traditional blue-colored trend and the wild fields of Tory's Small Englishism may say yes.
It is what Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn said on radio and television this week when the pathfinder fought in it, not to admit that Corby's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as shadow Chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father on television tried to be unfair to his Labour Cabinet colleagues without going too far and lose his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But fighting to remain "under all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, yet what JC told his fellows and MPs after all the reports at their closing session on Monday night.
Whatever the moving bottom-up image of Corbyn wants - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the social media's slum, a brute of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right for Cameron not to give a free card for Europe that allows him to keep Labour's support in the referendum campaign for self-evidentness, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corby's fundamental multifaceted EU membership – in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past – is no longer just a question of esoteric debate among left dissidents, for which the narcism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities about NATO - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC will not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense in everything for their leaders at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital, - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British if this can all be pointless?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a reduction in the cost of the Tory government in power, which I was reminded of at the beginning of Monday what was called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise Public Health England report on e-cigarettes
A state-funded agency's claim that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoke was created by a meeting of 12 people, in part with links to the tobacco industry, said researchers.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) join Lancet by criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "Fundamental Report" last month and described it as "a comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A guide article in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinaryly windy base" on which PhE founded its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers wrote in BMJ and asked whether the claims "constructed on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects that the claim of PHE that "the present best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who have been invited to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to bring their opinions on the damage of various nicotine-containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Health, whose manager was supposed to have received funding from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed the BAT references to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting stated to receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he should have received according to previous reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reasons for the selection of the members of the board are not provided, but include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also provide a sectoral funding in the paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The meeting also took part in the tobacco management of PHE.
The research work of the group is "significant", that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products on most criteria", wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, these links or restrictions are not discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the claims of PHE that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes serve as a way of smoking for children or non-smokers" were early.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at PHE, said that BMJ's claims had already been responded to earlier.
He said, "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second long-lived smoker dies in his search.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to this, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what does not, especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die of a disease each year with regard to smoking, and smoking costs the national health system two billion pounds a year.
The clear presentation of current evidence that e-cigarettes are not risk-free, but are only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national responsibility.
BBC should give up EastEnders, former head of Channel 4 says.
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop sending programs such as EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows such as Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for placing public-law programs, which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in highly controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and by broadcasters such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director General Tony Hall said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he had been trying to contact the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are being commissioned or sent, which would also be clearly shown by non-subsidized rivals," Johnson told the Upper House Communications Committee as part of his investigation into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not consider to be a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least make your production on programs that others do not do or order.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to get as broad as possible support for their future.
The idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's of course nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't see why a regressive tax program can be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, given to both own productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public-law television.
I don't think this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for the series, led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC owes it to the hunt for evaluations "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular broadcasts give back what the former leader of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that BBC shows like EastEnders should be sold.
Johnson said that the rather public-law Nischen programs "should go to BBC4 where you can't measure the audience quite, but they fulfill their tasks, and they can argue when they go on their seeming missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees, "Now, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that nobody has seen."
They put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them.
Johnson told the Committee about the broadcasting fee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system in relation to conditions that can get the best value out of this.
Of course you all think, we all think that you get a great value here for £150 a year, but for people who are a lot of money for £150, ask me if that's right, because they don't consume much from the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 Chief David Elstein, who also stated before the committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC review its Reithian mission to "informat, form and maintain".
He said that only a small part of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said it was 1% of their TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and they should take an example of public-law television channels in Australia and Canada to change this in "information, education and entertainment".
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said that BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, of which he said that only one handful will be shown on TV and enter alliances with commercial broadcasters to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction at the moment when they are screened with sound impulses.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of noise waves.
The tiny nematodes change the direction at a time when they are deceived by sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by activating motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to wear the membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves.
Further on this topic: Researchers read and write hirnativity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new process, called Sonogenetics, in which ultrasonics can be used to activate a series of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace deep-brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that gives an electrical impulse to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Cordworms usually do not react to ultrasonic noise, but Chalasani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, strengthen the ultrasonic waves that then penetrate the worms.
The reinforced ultrasonic waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The noise waves affect the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, such a report Nature Communications.
To create ultrasonic-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically altered the worms so that some of their motor neurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When it applies ultrasonic to the modified creatures, the sound waves will be reinforced by the microbroke bubbles and transferred to the worms, where they activate the modified motor neurons.
The process has some similarities with optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows the scientist to turn on and off neurons with light impulses.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent to the desired place in the brain at an optical fiber, low frequency ultrasonic waves of tissue can pass unhindered and thus can be sent to the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make targeted human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasonic signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture devices - right in front of your door!
The ads shame the British arms trade
Amnesty International Anti-Weapon watch fair video.
Terrible killer drones!
Leg joints that break your leg!
Streubomben!
And electroshock sticks that cause painful pain, but don't leave a trace!
The happy voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this display for the world's largest arms fair is a fighting parody produced by Amnesty International to bring the willingness of the British government to disaster light, to fend off weapons to repressive regimes over the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are visible at bus stops and in the subway trains and that require a second look.
"Important announcement: Do you drive with the DLR from September 15 to 18?" (Docklands Light Railway) is read in the London Underground fonts and the mark of the DLR line, which turns into an image of a tanker.
In September, a swarm of gun dealers will drive with the DLR ... customers will be asked to help stop the gun fair.
The 300 posters are from artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum for Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped with the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6-pound package of inbox keys, from which it is claimed that "access to around a third of the bus stop advertising surfaces on the planet."
Transport for London doesn't find this poster "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruelol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists will become more critical and try to bring political work to the public outside of galleries.
Many artists work with activists in protest movements and note that they have to go outside to the real world, so that their art has an influence on society.
Another anti-arms trading placard welcomes the pendants in the subway.
The Amnesty video was watched more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works with the graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP Creative Director Matt Liver was surprised by the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the weapons fair - through an empty spot of the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign that tries to avoid them."
They played with the invention of a more realistic and ambitious corporate advertising, but "through the insertion with bright colors and animation it remains more heavily held."
"They have done a fantastic job helping us to raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not illegal at our door.
Perhaps the most creative art around the gun fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors spray fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed a mission from the US army to "the AT4CS RS fired by the shoulder."
This includes "a uniquely shaped fighting head that delivers outstanding effects within the target."
Whatever it does will not be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Life in Student Homes
Eleven years ago, as a self-contained 19-year-old, I moved into a student's home, still believing in Berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the tense smiles of those I've been angry with - and the numerous, long-term complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled in eight simple rules.
The entrance to the student residence is from slightly nervous to absolutely frightening.
It's fascinating to talk about: tell people where you come from, whether and where you've taken the Sabbath year, where you're about Corby and why you're "sincerely saying Marmite doesn't love or hate, because seriously, guys, it's just a haha haha extract, I'm in my room."
Breathe through.
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find people you like unlike those you wouldn't talk to, even if your whistles were burning and these were fire extinguishers.
Let people go.
People's rooms often turn into drinks receptions, movie night venues and municipal meeting places, but they are also the places where people are attracted to and put their underwear back on.
Related to this: Do not think about starting a relationship with the Union
Introverted people are being treated roughly at the university.
Your room should be a place of refuge, but many student homes form a space-to-space cotton culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
That could be hell for someone who's trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to go on, but you have to go away so I can get back the energy I spent on the interaction with you."
Try to feel when a commilitone of company is exhausted - and send him a text instead.
Close your eyes: Do it.
A guy in my student residence had the idea that an unclosed door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Close friendship through bakery.
Since you start the union at the top of the back-manie, the knock on the doors of people is to imagine with a plate full of brownies, less strange than the welcome of the 1950s "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've baked something for you. So, and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions."
Offering homemade sweets is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obliged to stay and may eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a proper baker.
Badly mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people to fall asleep when you hit.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, the clowning of chickens is a theft, but is it the taking of a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check with the milk owner.
The chances are that they say to serve themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's angry, and you have my compassion - but try to act more balancedly than my roommate who added a detergent to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in prison now.
You shouldn't make a sound that keeps people from sleeping or from working.
It's not just about being a decent person, it's about being one of the people who sit in the glass house.
A girl on my floor asked her neighbors if it was up to them to put Drum & Bass something quieter, because it was three in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When she finally stopped at 5:00, she kindly let her neighbors sleep for two hours before she had her own music whispered, closed her door and went to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse were to take the same student home by accident?
On the other hand, would it not be deeply painful if you were to keep a roommate for your future spouse, to date them, to separate again, and then to see them every day and perhaps to share with each other how she brings them all together?
Of course, the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to convey a little sense to your subs.
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his key in his unclosed room, the boundary between a wolf and mobbing is finer than it seems.
A good strike is fun, but it only takes moments before it becomes the boomerang.
By hiding, give a valuable and fun lesson about safety - but never seduce someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their door, and place their keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but don't touch their possessions on the deck more than twice.
Order houses for refugees, self-employed, low-income
The real estate company Markus Gildner builds in the middle of the French corner houses for people who do not have much money.
For example, for refugees, but also as a sign: "Not only do refugees need shelter, but also the only raising mother and the poor earner."
"I show how you can still build cheap and good today," says the 44-year-old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will be forced into the housing market.
Entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes how quickly cheap living space can be created: He builds in a project series houses for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will be forced into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The massive accommodation in containers or tournaments has no sustainability.
Because people stay a lot here.
In view of the refugee flow, we also need adequate housing in the next few decades.
A completely banal, three-storey rowing house is the solution.
Gildner: A rowing house needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
That's different when you put people in blocks.
Each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for each of four asylum seekers.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs.
How high is the cost?
Currency: The price for 160 square meters Living area per house is 184,000 euros, without land.
That's observable.
Six months the construction took.
That's appropriate.
Did the construction regulations complicate their plans?
Guildner: I went through my project correctly.
Especially complicated, it always makes the threatening Damocles sword special construction and the place regulation.
That's disgusting.
It is still subject to who creates three apartments in a row house, needs at least three seats.
Only in the cities there is room for this.
And refugees and asylum seekers don't have cars.
How did the inhabitants react to their row house project?
Gildner: There were some who suggested to me to create luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely wrong.
But do you not intensify the competition for affordable apartments?
Gildner: True: We had a building in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built that can hardly afford one more.
My project has the message, even the normal people need a living room.
Not only refugees, but also the raising mother or the poor earner.
I'm showing you how you can still build cheap and good today.
That's what this is about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and first dealt with environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is published
The new operating system can be requested by going to the configuration app, typing "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
If it's ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install.
Some have crashed after installation as they received an error message which indicates that the "software update failed".
To address the problem, it is recommended that users either wait until the storm returns or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more unlikely by reducing the update. It will also be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is up-to-date or is located near a charging device so that the battery is charged.
If the load is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue, as the phone may turn off half way and this could lead to a break-up of the update.

Rosberg's only currency: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg knows in the fight the WM title in Formula 1 against his clear lead Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton just another currency: "Full Attack".
The second WM stressed before the start of the crucial seven overseas races, "that I have nothing to lose anymore".
53 points separate the vice-world champion before the evening break in Singapore this Sunday by title defender and double champion Hamilton.
Britain has already won seven of the 12 previous season races and is also taking the floodlight Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old British was able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will have an influence on the great price of Singapore is still unclear.
For days a thunderstorm hangs over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger chess club has a prominent member
The chess club "Bad Kissingen Chess Friends" was founded three months ago, and another member was included in its series, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is Entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who has stayed in Bad Kissingen for more than 40 times.
Gauselmann is the founder of the First Class of the town of Speelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation that President Alfred Klein accepted.
This allows for the inclusion of chess players who are unable to pay the member's contribution.
Youth work and talent research should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that the membership of the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Rot-White" will be seen as an expression of its connection to the resort.
Quarter office looking for direct contact
Saludis and the Old Center Antonistift have merged under the cover of the Social Foundation and opened a new starting point at the Graf-Stuffenberg Square.
In addition to consultations, you can also participate in courses.
The social foundation pulls it down from the mountain into the city.
More precisely said at the Count Stauffenberg Square.
A new district office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, you will immediately receive seniors and consulting information on issues such as health insurance or health care services.
For years we have found with our ambulance that caregivers are often left alone.
There are endlessly many questions.
"Neither are many of the benefits of the funds rarely taken into account, because the complexity of the insurance is not yet understood," explained the new housekeeper Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Civil Hospital as well as for the ambulance service "Amadeus".
In addition to the consultations, the new headquarters also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
To this end, the Saludis was taken into the boat.
Therefore, additional offers such as emergency prevention, memory training or physical therapy can be used.
The offers from the Senior Center and the Saludis are complemented in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, precautions and reha.
"The Senior Care and Care Centre", said Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is seen by the two business leaders especially in demographic change.
Because this makes a good decentralized infrastructure essential in the individual parts of Bamberg in the future.
In addition, as Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) stressed at the inauguration celebrations, the district office also dedicated itself to the association of age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and invite them to a regular gathering".
This made a great contribution by the Social Foundation to enable seniors to live as independently and well as in their familiar environment.
The quarter office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 14 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 16 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.
Entrance Bamberg against Würzburger Kickers on October 6th
Now it is official: After the appointment for the game FC Entracht Bamberg was not yet set against the third-party Würzburg Kickers, the 6th of October was set as the appointment.
The meeting of the FC Entracht Bamberg in the eighth final of the Bavarian Football Totopokals against the third-rate FC Würzburger Kickers was now finally finished.
It will be played on Tuesday, October 6, at 7.00 p.m. in the Bumberger Fuchspark Stadium.
"We are pleased that we now know when the game is going over the stage, we now have planning security," said FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the pre-sale of cards now started.
It is special for our team to play against a third party.
We therefore look forward to numerous spectators, and this is not without reason, because flood lights have a special ruse.
In the round of the last 16 teams, the FC Entracht Bamberg 2010 won the District List 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and home against the Regional List 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition receives 5000 euros and is qualified for the first round of the 2016/2017 DFB Association.
Title Defender is a third-country national SpVgg Unterhaching.
Wiener Architect Karl Mang died 92-year-old
Karl Mang, one of the Doyennes of Vienna's architecture, is dead.
He died on 5 September at the age of 92, as the artist's house announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the artist's house lost an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was called in the exhibition.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture during and after the Second World War at the Technical University in Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann.
Since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect, but has also been a teacher, writer and head of Institute.
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute for Forming.
In the 1980s he was commissioned with the establishment of the treasure house in Vienna Hofburg and the conversion of the Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Park penalty: Tim Wiese throws cops with money
Ex-Footballer Tim Wiese is ill-fated in Bremen.
At one time, footballers were engaged by Tim Wiese, former National Guards in Germany and at Bremen and Hoffenheim, Wrestler.
30 kilogram muscle mass he wants to add according to his own statement in the past two years.
He didn't intellectually admit it.
Wiese was allowed to cut his hair in the city of Bremer, just as he saw a parking guard outside of the parking lot showing a list of penalties for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese then stormed out of the store, politicsed the official and threw her the fallish fine in front of the feet, as the "image" time reported.
In the city of Bremen, the rejection is confirmed, but the consequences for the unusual incident are not yet clear.
"The thing is still in the test," it says from the city of Bremen.
Only then will it be decided whether or not to show wisdom.
Authorities of Panama destroy 4500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the rain forest climate of Isla del Rey are best suited for the cultivation of marijuana plants.
For three days the Panamanian authorities have been expelling 4,500 plants and burning them.
Men flock to 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses are looking for the police for an event in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, at 2:45 p.m., three young men were on their way to Bad Soden in the direction of Salmünster.
One out of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends, according to the police, at a distance of about five metres, and asked them to wait for him.
At that time the group was at the height of the bft station.
There were also three persons on the grounds of the station.
One of these men now screamed at the young man and slapped him in the face with his fist.
The victim suffered a nasal fracture and was bleeding heavily from the nose.
When his two friends gathered and spoke abusively of the beatings, he first left his victim.
From his friends the injured young man was now brought home.
The perpetrator chased the group with a car up to their apartment and drove there demonstically several times.
When one no longer saw the vehicle, the injured man went outside the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the striker and another male person.
With the help of a battalion, the victim was struck with his face and his upper jaw.
The injured person had to be brought to a hospital for medical treatment.
So far, there is only one vague criminal description.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters tall.
The second blower was about 1.65 meters tall and was dressed in a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and referees to report under telephone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over Praxis Felstehausen and invests 310000 Euro
Silvia Müller-Gongol and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
Mayor Bernd Bormann, Minister of Economic Affairs Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asenddorf Mayor Heinfried Kabbert are also happy about this.
In many places in the country, doctors - Asenddorf, however, are happy: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Felstehausen on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen is going to rest, her husband Karl-Heinrich is standing next to his successor in the coming months with half a place.
After a conversion phase, Müller reopens the practice on October 12, until then he invests 310000 euros in the rooms on St. Marcelusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at the first sight when the Felstehausen met Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongol, who is currently completing their specialist training at the Verden Hospital and wants to go into practice next year.
"We always had in mind that the müllers would fit well in this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laugh.
"As long as it was, I just called her."
The couple Müller felt the idea of operating their own practice in Asenddorf in the future.
"The closeness and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us," says 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to meet and accompany the families over the years."
As an advantage he also sees himself soon as his own boss.
And so you agreed that the Müllers bought the house with the practice.
They will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There the double family father Frank Müller is also raised, his medical study in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently an obstetrician in Sullingen, and was appointed to the leading notarzt in 2009 in Diepholz County and is honorably involved in the DRK readiness of Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
As of 19 September, the practice for the new boss is being prepared.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a house doctor, his Gattin Ursel (internistist) specializes in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internalists, want to retire as home doctors.
"The endoscopy is therefore coming out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gogoll.
After the reconstruction, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasonic tests as well as long-term and load ECGs and need more room.
In addition, the EDV will be completely renewed.
A total of EUR 50000 is awarded to the millers under a support programme from the Land Circle (25000 euros) as well as from the municipality (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is being carried on," stresses Mayor Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongol, about 2000 patients come to the Felstehausen practice every quarter, in which the North German average practice is about 500.
In Asenddorf there is another house doctor's practice.
A positive side effect of the practice takeover by Frank Müller: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy remains in Asenddorf.
If no successor had been found, she would have gone too.
However, those who visit Müller's speaking hours continue to look mainly at familiar faces: they take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the rock houses.
Their farewell ends in Asenddorf an era, yet the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"At first we had only two rooms," recalls Ursel Felstehausen.
A little wetness on her after a long time.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and many patients will probably still see," says the internalist.
Her husband laughs: "We have a 6000 square metre piece of ground."
"Bisher, I've always pushed myself before garden work, now it could be different."
In addition, the couple has two singles and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"Now the border controls are also high at our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The checks at the Hungarian border remain parallel to this.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can also make this "of course".
The provision and security of people are at the forefront.
But of course, "it needs clear signals," said the minister.
People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows, nor across the Austrian-Slovene border.
There is a need for a controlled procedure.
Croatia considering Corridor Slovenia denied
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also want to allow arriving refugees to travel further towards Austria and Germany and, under circumstances, to establish corridors for the refugees.
However, this was not the case with Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", rather Slovenia will intensify monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary.
On the other hand, the border with Croatia has already been heavily controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister stressed, Slovenia does not want to withdraw its borders for refugees.
"Each EU member must fulfil his or her obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," said Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government reported, the first refugees had already tried to enter East Croatia at the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing in order to avoid registration in the hours of the night.
The Croatian police were able to attack her in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been in the Croatian factory ever since.
It is mainly about Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Salvation services and the Red Cross are already in use.
Over the next few days, his country has some 4,000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo at the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be redirected towards Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday.
The government in Belgrade, however, contends that it is it that people are instructed to set certain paths: "We can still, we still want to do this," it said.
According to the media reports, in the early morning, a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border city of Sid, which would be expected to continue in the course of the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The insasses had been on the way all night from the Macedonian border about 500 kilometres away by Serbia.
"We have heard that Hungary has committed, so the police told us to go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
This could, in fact, lead to a slightly further western route to Turkey-Greece-Macedonian-Hungary-Hungary, which has already been predicted by observers.
Croatia: "Comprehensive opportunities for border control"
Croatia's Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible emergency situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but he pointed out that Croatia as a non-schengen member has "wide-ranging possibilities for border control".
Strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been one of these since 2007, and EU partners have been providing a good witness to the country since then as regards the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, about 300 refugees remain behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade's media reports, they spent the last night at the border crossing of Horgos, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely blocked.
Whether the remaining refugees now want to move on to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down in a locality in Horgos on Wednesday morning: he held the debate on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border has now been closed.
It would not be very high numbers of refugees at the moment.
You still cannot say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute to the refugee maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous: in parts of the border area, there are still unexploited mines in the area 20 years after the end of the Croatian war.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of miners had been sent to the border region.
Exchange hacker: Ukrainians pay 30 million dollars
Suprananok is supposed to have been part of a ring of cybercriminals, who have since 2010 been asked to have been constantly gaining insight into unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwire and PR Newswire.
The information obtained should have been made available on the financial markets.
In this way, it is estimated that a total of over $100 million was made available to the investigators.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our country's borders are finally captured," says the SEC Communication.
The proceedings against 32 other accused continued in the case.
Most of the accused came from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators should have acted both in the US and in Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical hospice aid Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
Around the Mannheimer Paradeplatz there is a real business.
People perform their concerns, partly quick steps, partly welcoming.
They control the two stations of the Mannheim auto salon at the parade site.
Keep the city tracks.
Pulsating, pulsating life in the glorious autumn sun and in the middle of four big tables each with the title "Before I want to die"....
The Ecumenical Hospice Aid has brought this action to the attention of its 20-year-old existence and is fully confronted with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so with the action we've gone in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The Head of Economic Hospice Aid is also available to passersby for questions and discussions as well as to the honorary employees.
While a passerby spontaneously grabs the crew and the sentence about "my life", "can read", "drive with the camper through the United States", "stop the war" or "don't suffer long", others stay short, read, say sentences like "so far I'm not yet" and then go on.
At the edge, there is always little discussion about the action on themselves, about life, about dealing with death.
Peter Hübinger is also on the scene.
"Only when I realize that the end of this world will come to me will I be able to live responsibly," says Mannheim, director of the Diaconical Works, who is together with the Caritas Association of Economic Hospice Aid.
Therefore, this public action is good for the 20-year-old.
That not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tables, however, is understandable, and finally it is a very personal matter.
The subject of death and death is still occupied with tabus, so the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospice movement in recent years has contributed greatly to the opening of people.
An estimate that Angelika Godfroid shares.
The death and mourning companion is one of the honorary employees of the first hour.
Personal experience confronts the subject, she reads a lot of literature and decides to want to engage in the aid of death.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Aid was sought by the Honorary, it was immediately registered and was at its founding in 1995.
Godefroid is a team of 45 honorary - 43 women and two men - accompanied by the affected and related in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the Hospiz Sankt Vincent.
They're all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can deal well with her task and the experiences and experiences she has gained.
"I see life from another waiting, consider it precious and value the moment," she says.
The offer of the outpatient Ecumenical Hospital Service is free of charge and free of charge.
The financial support of hospitals and donations from relatives and associations enables training as well as the continuation and supervision of the death and mourning companions.
Every two years training is offered for new employees.
The tables described on Saturday are now shown in the house of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There are also other personal wishes listed on postcards.
FedEx result mixed, financial perspectives decreased for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the supplier giant reduced its profit outlook to a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At that time last year, FedEx announced that the company wanted to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
The stock fell by over 2.5 percent in the premarket trade 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the business year ending next May, 20 cent less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84 according to a survey of FactSet.
The lower outlook comes in spite of the price increases, which average 4.9% and are effective on 4 January, and despite higher supplements for soil transport of heavy and large packages, which will be raised from November.
The company said that it nevertheless expected that the result for the previous year will increase due to lower costs, higher revenues and growth in online trade.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "gives solid profits when considering the weaker economic conditions than expected, especially in manufacturing and global trade".
The plans for the holiday employment were announced one day later than that of the rival UPS, which plans to set up 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, such as the same number as last year.
In the quarter that ended on August 31st, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
The result per share was $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share, predicted by twelve analysts asked by Zacks Investment Research.
Turnover rose by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six of Zacks' analysts expected $1.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has had a decline in international priority shipping, which has led to the stagnation of sales in its unit express shipping.
But the tree in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales increased by 29 per cent in soil transport, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result fell due to higher labour costs in the freight business.
In the pre-market trade, like an hour before the opening, the FedEx shares decrease by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $10.15.
On Tuesday, it closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record booth on June 11th.
At their most expected meeting in the year, the Federal Reserve spends two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide whether it is time to raise leadership for the first time for almost a decade.
Threatening about them at the end of the decorated, two-sided sitting room is a wall picture of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed President Janet L. Yellen and his colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation ahead of everything else.
The Central Bank has a dual mandate from Congress: to maximize US employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too close to predict. It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be relieved of the unprecedented incentive by the short-term interest rate that is close to zero since the end of 2008.
Although most economic data show that they are growing solid, the latest turbulence on global financial markets could make the already prudent Fed representatives afraid to increase this volatility by raising the interest rate on federal bonds - and it is only about a quarter of a point.
"The labour market and inflation will obviously be the most important thing they've seen," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the broker firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for a pretext not to increase interest rates, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself insures the financial market.
About half of the economists who had recently been questioned by Bloomberg predicted an increase in interest this week.
However, the financial markets expect a wait for the feed, with a key indicator showing only a 30% chance of an increase.
This means a decline in the stock market, if the feed increases the rate, unless the strategies mitigate the impact by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 228.89 points or by 1.4% to 16.599,85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy will maintain the sentence this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise the rates at that time," he said.
If she does, "she had to go very far in her statement to calm down the financial markets so that they wouldn't panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest would calm down financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the fed will act.
Another month ago, the Fed seemed to be in a good way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow strengthening of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the USA.
Yellen had said in the spring and in the early summer that she expected an increase in the rate this year despite the complaints of Liberals that more economic progress would be needed.
Although the creation of jobs slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level seen by the fed as full employment.
Increases in wages have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation remained below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world came together at the end of last month, after China had devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16% in May, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would lead to global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, while the Dow is now almost 10% below the top of May.
For Fed representatives, market turbulence affects the complex calculation when to increase interest rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would have been attracted to the tiles at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former U.S. notary bank employee.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least one month to get the effects better into the grip.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy, and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The influence of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere mention of the then leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "veregen" its monetary expansion resulted in confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed representatives can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision finding is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global asset management strategy of Investnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA, observed this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions on financial market movements that are apparently not linked to the economic fundamental data."
Lacker, a qualified member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who is working for an increase in interest, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia has led the Fed to reduce its leadership by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions "in spite of limited detectable effects on growth in the USA", said Lacker.
A year later, the Fed representatives withdrew these cuts.
The Fed should focus on aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England interest-fixing committee.
The latest turbulence does not come close to this level, he said.
"She certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are upset," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not believe that it should prejudge time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/store was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown and not Thailand.
The market/save is a central starting point and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need motor oil.
The store is huge, and it takes an hour to climb through the corridors.
If the whole shopping experience makes you hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The garage (good and priced) in this shop is close to the boxes and has various pick-up options.
What is there here: Do you need something - something - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are valuable and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat teapot is extensive, as is the fish teapot - the staff behind the tea will clean up and fibrate the fish and even if desired for you.
A good part of the shop belongs to the massive freezer department. Here you can find frozen curry leaves, bitter melons and galgant, whole ducks, fish, bovine blood and galle, pork natural intestine, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared food and more.
Who buys here: Restaurant owners and kitchens, including individual families and individuals.
The wide corridors are suitable for shopping carts and forks.
You can find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the box.
Where it is located: The shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the edge of Chinatown and the city centre - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking lot.
Hoyerswerda: Small aid for refugees
More and more refugees come to Germany this day.
To offer you a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless honorable helpers.
In Hoyerswerda there are also a number of people who support useless asylum seekers in the city.
These include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She still likes to teach with her 74 lenses.
Every Thursday she does it at the asylum place on Dillinger Street.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan learn the German language.
Of course, this is quite different from that of a proper school.
Brazilian Paediatric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy rest
The Brazilian Paediatric Organisation SPRS is trying to explain in shocking ways how important good nutrition is during the rest period. It does this with the presentation of images of babies who suck on breasts that are painted with unhealthy foods.
Mother milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are expected to increase their daily intake of calories by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research results suggest that higher intake of calories is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A current study led by Robert Waterland, Professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually concerns the genes of their babies and protects them against the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child may negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernerier Sports Hall
The municipality of Bernried approved the construction request for the 2.3 million euros prize sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may become flat for solar system.
The plans for the long-term construction of the tournaments at Bernried sports grounds are moving forward step by step: in the recent municipal meeting, the design of the project was consistently blessed without major discussions.
The Board had previously decided, inter alia, to apply for a "exception" or "exemption" from the valid construction plan.
The "exception" was the permit for a special shape for roof construction.
A "satellach with non-middle first and roof surface" is then to be built.
The planning is based on the intended use of the roof area for solar systems: "This will bring us together a wonderfully large Southtech," said Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
The 'freedom' was, again, about the roofing which should be below 10 degrees for energy reasons - unlike the construction plan.
This greatly reduces the volume of the hall.
A "freedom" was therefore necessary because the construction plan does not allow "exemption" in relation to the roof - in which the Bernried municipality is generally more restrictive in the case of release applications.
However, in the construction of the tournament, it is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent," said Steigenberger.
The tournament building at the sports center is a community project of the municipality and of the SV Bernried.
At the cost, around 2.3 million euros are encalculated.
Grants are expected from school and broadband promotion.
In the next step of the procedure, the construction request for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is now submitted to the Land Council for inspection.
Peißenberg clinic moves to Schongau
The Peißenberg Hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - that is 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) will become the new medical director at Schongau Hospital.
The station as well as the majority of employees are moving from Pißenberg to Schongau.
This is reflected in the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the Land Circle, confirmed by Land Counsellor Andrea Jochner-White.
However, a decision on this will be taken by the Supervisory Board and will take place next Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans were implemented, all of the almost 50 employees at the hospital in Pißenberg would continue to be employed.
The majority is intended to move to Schongau with fishermen and the remaining internal station.
The rooms are there.
The employees who cannot go to Schongau should be offered a job in Weilheim, Jochner-White.
The staff were informed of the plans.
The change has triggered the cancellation of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has been a medical director of the Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now changing to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital.
According to Jochner-White, the name "fisher" came into play, which declared itself ready to take the lead from October 1st and to switch with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau this means in any case a "evaluation" and a dissemination of the offer in the field of "Internal Medicine", says Jochner-White.
Fischer is a specialist for heartbreakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is specialized in gastroenterological diseases at the internal station.
Transitionally for the next two years, Fischer and his team, if the Board of Supervisors agrees, will lead both houses until the next year the former hospital of the hospital, which still has 35 beds, will be finally closed in Pißenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the Landkreis had planned this for 2018 when the current repair at the Weilheim Hospital has been completed.
Land Counsellor Jochner-White, who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board, opposed rumors that the house in possession of the Federal button should be used in the future as accommodation for asylum tissues.
As with the property, Jochner-White could not say there are several considerations.
There are currently a short-term care of the Caritas and a daily psychiatry.
"What better thing could not happen to us, such an opportunity will not come again," said Fischer about the Quasi transport to the Lech, which was "positive and very understandable" by the employees.
A real perspective for the house, where a fisherman has worked as a chef for over 30 years, has not existed.
He was asked by colleagues from Schongauer to take over the positions of the Director of Medicine.
The Peißenberg Hospital (some 100 beds) has been under constant threat of closure in the past decades. Departments have been closed, such as surgery and birth care.
The handballs of Rhein-Neckar Löwen are requested at the Bergian HC tonight (20.15 p.m.).
The head of the Bundesliga table in Wuppertal is the clear favorite, but there is no reason for superiority.
In the last season, the bathers at the BHC referred to a painful defeat and have some good taste there.
Hunting accident with two victims in Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the evening on a corn field near Pratau (Landkreis Wittenberg), several hunters were in use, as the police reported.
After a shooting, a 63- and 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and was brought to hospitals.
Just as the accident was likely to occur, it was unclear at first.
The criminal police are on the scene.
Missing 16-year-old from Rheinland-Pfalz Victims of Violence Crimes
A suspect has led the police to the body of 16-year-olds missing from Rhineland-Palatinate since Saturday.
In the interview, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the young and throwing their bodies into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old from Rheinland-Pfalz who has been missing since Saturday fell victim to a violent crime.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslauter, as the prosecutor and police announced on Wednesday.
As a suspect, a 20-year-old who was arrested on the day of the service day was also considered to have been informed and led the investigator to the body's location.
The 16-year-old was missing on Sunday morning after coming home after a visit to a autumn party in Rockenhausen.
In the search for the young woman, the investigators first focused on personal objects of the victim.
In the case of questions in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing, a suspicion of the 20-year-olds finally turned out.
The alleged offender then led the police to a channel in Rockenhausen where the body was found.
The detainee informed the authorities in police proceedings that he had killed the 16-year-old and put the body in the channel.
The 20-year-old should be brought to the courthouse on Wednesday, and the investigators put him to death.
The further investigation should be carried out on the circumstances of the case.
Refugees need accommodation: Study warns against housing shortages
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for a payable stay.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have long begun.
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing a market that is already overloaded in many major cities.
They compete with poor income citizens for the latest affordable apartments.
In order to meet the demand for affordable apartments, 400,000 new units had to be built each year by 2020.
This results in a study commissioned by the Association of Social Housing Buildings.
For comparison: 260,000 units will be completed in Germany this year.
This means 140,000 apartments are missing.
Refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a first accommodation after the first three months of their stay.
Many then hit the apartment market and opt into the long hoses in front of the apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, last year less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising numbers of refugees.
The study has also resulted in significant gaps in housing policy in recent years.
Germany faces a housing deficit, which is growing from year to year.
Currently, about 770,000 residential units were missing in the embalming areas, complained of by Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many professionals therefore lived in large cities in WG-rooms.
Young adults remained unvoluntary longer in the "Hotel Mama" because of the fluctuation in the apartment market.
In the capitals, the number of square meters per head has been reduced for the first time in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the Alliance of Social Housing proposes a restart.
New incentives are designed to reinvigorate social housing.
In this way, the basic labour tax could be waived and the basic tax imposed on assisted apartments would be suspended.
In addition, according to the Federation, attractive tax depreciation options are necessary.
The funding programme for refugee accommodation in the State Bank KfW is already well placed in cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start of Monday night, with 184 million euros, more than half of the approximately 300 million euros available had already been collected.
Now the project could even be upgraded.
Refugees have free access: Croatia and Slovenia set up Corridor
After Hungary there is practically no more breakthrough, as more and more refugees choose the way across Croatia.
Zagreb announces to grant the transit through Slovenia to the north without fences.
The route is dangerous, though.
Croatia wants to understand with the neighbouring country Slovenia about the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I spoke to the Slovenian Interior Minister, and if necessary we will organize a corridor," said Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the abolition of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have broken up to Croatia to reach Western Europe.
500 people have come across the border at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian TV RTL.
Hungary had reached its border on refugees on the eve of the day.
New laws, which came into force on the same day, also make proper asylum procedures in Hungary practically redundant.
Croatia wants the refugees to pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said, "They can travel, and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, there are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, there are people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had taken the first refugees at Serbia's border to Croatia's EU-neighbor country in the morning.
Most media reports came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both by bus and by taxi to the Serbian border city Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to reach Croatia on foot across the green border.
On the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees did not come to the border.
The border strips pose other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav Civil War in the 1990s.
Mining rooms should now quickly create a safe passage.
After the closure of the border, hardly any more refugees come to Hungary.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people assaulted.
Shortly before the torso on Monday, there had been 9380.
The new Hungarian laws include the overcoming and damaging of the border fence as a punishment.
For this reason, 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border city of Szeged.
The convicts were threatened with imprisonment for up to five years and expulsion from the country.
According to the Immigration Authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established "transit zones" at the border, almost all of them - 93 - the most important crossing of Röszke.
Among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people.
In the middle of the morning, 40 more refugees remained there.
However, practically no one has any prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungary, Serbia is a "safe third country".
Those who refused asylum should be postponed there.
Only a few hundred refugees gathered before the "transit zone" in Röszke.
In Röszke, workers began to clean up.
They collected the garbage that had left tens of thousands of people in the last few weeks on the street.
Blockers were decomposed and one of the collection camps at the border was rebuilt.
No one wanted to speak for the purpose of this reconstruction.
After the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary, Austria reaches only a few refugees.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
However, some 20,000 migrants were reportedly still in the country.
In Salzburg, about 1,400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
The train from there to Germany was stopped on the morning at the request of the German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived at the foot.
Mayor "Border" drove across the border
"We were busy cleaning after the bridge party on Sunday, when suddenly ten people stood with travel bags at the entrance of the tent," says Wernstein Mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
However, because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the beachmen along with two other helpers and their cars over the border to the nearby Passau.
Previously, we ate the unexpected guests only once, with juice and drinks.
We just said, we'll take them by car to Passau.
"That was for us of course," said Stadler in the OÖN conversation.
They were very grateful.
A man did not allow himself to hand over a generous gift - 100 euros for the firearm.
"That made us very happy," says Stadler.
The beached train passengers had moved from an ICE to a regional train in Passau on Sunday evening to Wels to try to cross the border after the short-term announcement that rail traffic had been stopped to Germany.
However, the regional train was postponed in front of the border in Wernstein at the Inn.
In Wernstein the cross-border is generally high in the course.
The bridge party associated with the Bavarian neighbours on Sundays, days before a two-bridge race sporting - organized by the Union of Wernstein and Bayern from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán is sending us more than one thousand Roma now is a logical result of a seeming holy policy:
Instead of helping immediately in the camp of Röszke to create structures that guarantee humanity, our Federal Chancellor has officially and publicly reduced the attitude of the Hungarian government to the dynamism of national socialism.
The leaders of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees will also have to find that the " promised land", which they have invited and welcomed, is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge in view of the ongoing refugee flows and the coming winter, to create humane conditions for those seeking protection with us.
And it will be even greater - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad looking for 35,000 winter party quarters
Konrad has all his hands full with the refugee detention.
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to establish quarters for thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first recording center Traiskirchen has already gotten into the grip of Konrad.
"We no longer have homeless in Traiskirchen," he reported on his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had arrived in Austria on Monday was also without great dizziness, Konrad said and praised the organizational "winnership".
On the other hand, the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a "crisisful situation".
Overall, Konrad has a need of 85,000 quarters this year.
In order to meet the figure, 35,000 more accommodation will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 will be provided by the countries, 15,000 from the Federal Republic.
If there's more refugees, we can make it.
"But it's not a face without soil," said Konrad.
He has already had discussions with the people of the land.
These would have assured him that he would still create for the next refugee quarters.
"It's going well in Upper Austria," said Ferry Maier.
Former VP mandater supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, to be clarified how the Church will help.
The Asylum Coordinator also puts great expectations into the ORF action "Helping Like Us".
On the platform individuals can offer uncomplicated accommodation.
In addition, you hope for hotels that are empty in winter.
Yesterday, Konrad and Maier criticised the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In emergency times, it cannot be that quartiers must keep a certain height of the handle holder or the size of the upper lights.
For a limited period, "standards" should apply.
In contrast to the Ministry of the Interior, Konrad, who is a successful host, is motivated by his experience.
I am an older gentleman, who is not told the truth without another face.
Convinced force is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cause the Republic any costs, as they themselves declared.
They want to increase their number to three to four.
The search for its own neighborhood has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
But there are obviously problems with approval.
Linz demands a better division
First, there is no opening of city sports and other buildings such as Tip Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees, the city of Linz plans.
This is not necessary at the moment, since it is possible to stop those who are currently affected without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, for the emergency, further locations should be checked for their viability.
Criticism is practiced by the mayor in the division of refugees within the Federal Republic.
Other areas also have to contribute to this.
Seehofer: "Limits are not eliminated"
In a longer phone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Landeshauptmann Josef Pühringer (VP) agreed on Monday to further action on the issue of refugees.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders will not be exhausted.
The further travel of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, there are now the corresponding border controls.
Special trains with refugees to Germany will be no longer available.
However, the applicants would be brought with regular trains to Germany.
From the other EU Member States, Pühringer once called for more solidarity in the issue of refugees.
For Pühringer, the fact that Austria is now reintroducing controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" from the German practice.
The next Runtastic is a question of time
The generalization of the "New yard" in the Linzer industrial line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the listed IT group S&T is to be rented to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In the IT are the smart heads of our raw material - and we have to try and work for us," says S&T Chief Hannes Niederhauser.
He can imagine investing in startup firms of the New Company and later which to acquire.
From the beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - some of which Niederhauser promises: "The next Runtastic is just a matter of time".
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T in the location, 3.3 million euros from the Tech Centre, which is one third of the city of Linz, the country of Upper Austria and the Federal Federal Republic of Germany (FFG).
The building is packaged by Linz AG for 60 years at S&T and Techcenter.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters area in the building is already rented, for another 40 percent there are requests.
Lia Peroni owner opened second store in the arcade
In the new shop, Furla handbags are in the center.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to add a dog.
This project had to be postponed briefly by the 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the pipe market arcade: finally, it has now grown in the form of another business premises.
In the Furla shop opposite the store in which they sell bags, suitcases, shoes and clothing from different manufacturers, everything is now turning around to have women's handbags from the brand Furla, money exchanges are from 75 euros.
Large bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
Since yesterday, the new shop has been in operation.
Several weeks ago, it was rebuilt.
"But I've been thinking for a long time about opening up another shop," Breit says.
Among other things, the decision was that the Furla producers who are at home in Bologna were also made from the idea of their own location, where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the Greater Linz who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters, who owns Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been put in the way of her mother's width.
Most of the time, I find myself developing something and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why so many women are in mourning when looking at a nice handbag, also the expert cannot answer with last certainty.
Maybe it's because a nice bag is worth every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kalllstadt
The Pfalzer ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called the "Residents".
This property is also associated with the billionaire who wants to become President of the United States.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for thrillers.
Whether he expresses himself hostilely, talks of journalists or reveals a lack of knowledge in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. President strongly stimulates the election campaign.
And cut it off.
This is also registered in the town of Callalz, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the hairdresser is a term for many in the wine village on the wine road.
Some in the 1200-inhabited place are over -zig corners related to it.
His grandfather came from Callstadt in the Pfalz: Donald Trump, here in the electoral mode.
Caller Simone Wendel was filming a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about their goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I believe that they find this kind of exciting, but they are not so deeply impressed in their call city art," says Simone Wendel.
The native townkeeper has turned a funny documentary film about the place and its famous leapers, including the Ketchup family Heinz, along with Trump.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also speaks in "Kings of Callstadt" (2014), saying that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Callstadt.
He didn't bring it there to the king of hearts.
Although there is respect for the performance of the family, but also tends to think that Trump is "a bit of a big wall", says Wendel.
By chance, the peak name, the call city in the area, "The Brulljesmacher" - to Hochdeutsch: the indicator, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the signatories.
The Trump's success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emigrated to the United States and opened a place for gold miners.
The real estate company was the first real estate buyers in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free from tragedy: your desire to return to the home for a time failed in the Bavarian state, to which the Pfalz belonged at the time.
He didn't record Trump because he was out of his mind once without permission, the director of the Institute for Pfalcian History and Folk Art, Roland Paul, told the film to start.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal immigrant".
This contrasts with the outstanding statements of the offspring.
He had repeatedly spoken reprehensibly about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"As the poltert, this is not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump ("The grandmother was a born Trump, the grandfather was born Heinz").
The winer in rest sees the American rather distant, "he is always so exciting".
Does he think Trump's coming?
"I can't imagine," says 72-year-old.
"He never cared about Call City."
The pension manager Veronika Schramm mentions as some call cities that a descendant of the Heinz family spent something on a visit to the church organ, which was generally well achieved.
"I can't imagine that from Donald," says 68-year-old.
She felt better if he didn't win the election, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's good."
If those who had said the same thing at the time of his grandfather in the United States were like him, "he never came there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzer daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as President?
"It's not my president," she says.
And: "The grapes will be ripe without the president Trump."
Wendel's film, for which Trump was interviewed for a long time, saw 12,000 filmmakers, also in the United States, attracts interest.
The upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first mountain village.
From the vice president of the German Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-inhabitant village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday.
In Austria there are already 20 mountain villages.
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the award.
A mountain village may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protection zone.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the reviews, despite the attempts of Nina to take over the loss of leadership at today's show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson follow to Canberra to report the loss of the Liberal leadership, but it has not produced any major shifts in the evaluations for today.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast by the Federal Capital when Malcolm Turnbull created Tony Abbott's crash.
The rival Sunrise, with the moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was part of a weekly series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of distance did not seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise achieved an average of 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to Today 339,000.
Today, there was a slight increase in the ratings for Monday (317.000) and last Tuesday (283.000), but its number remained after the last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap on Sunrise in the last few months.
Today, on average, 318,000 reached the 330,000 of Sunrise in August.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise is 314,000 with an average of 349,000 viewers.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change concern these people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the check!

The great novelty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently adopted father who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show Solo without the rapists Star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result answered this with a clear "Yes".
The X factor of Seven remained strong with 1,136 million spectators and slightly beat The Block (838.000) and TBL families (726.000).
Seven had mixed results at night two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 5.30 p.m.) of the new Quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, represented an average of 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17:30 till 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot Seat (613.000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia won 520,000 spectators and in the second half of the hour sat 720,000.
Hot-seat average 620,000.
The decline in the quotas of the second evening of The Chase Australia will confidently agree that hot-seat will finally take place at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars minute that didn't make it to fly the McGuires show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret Revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markosski may have been uninformed about who wins The Bachelor.
The woman, where Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor, was hidden in the largest secret.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly be praised if she is the one who has received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons Fellows on the day before they were three, you may have reported who the winner will be.
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the end on Thursday
All three women have lyrically given up on why Wood is the perfect man and in doing so called his sense of humor, greed, family values and positive attitude as a reason why they want to be his partner.
However, when the question is asked "If you don't, who should Woods get the last rose?", their answers to the game destroyer, who won the heart of the Bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski called both fast - except for themselves - Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other since the first day.
"From the moment I went home and noticed (Sarah) and Sam's energies, I felt they were pretty compatible, and I thought about it all over the show," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet, it makes so much fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel pleasant and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be better suited as a couple.
From her point of view Mackay said last week that the home visit made it clear that Wood could be "the One."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now completely on him," she said.
And when she was asked who Wood was to choose, if she wasn't, she was terrible.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the rest of the girls alike - it's an indistinct between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday, 7:30 p.m., on Ten.
Originally released as Sarah's first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his transfer to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a smart decision.
Some trainers would have banned Hayne from the bank for the rest of the game when he lost an angel as much as the Aussie-Rugby-Liga conversion at his first point return on Tuesday at the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a point-return and also to the current game after a violation of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the changing cabin after the game.
Instead of grinding his boots in front of the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his press conference after the game.
The 49th sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who begged him to forget his caught and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne fits at a point that was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the beginning, Hayne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after the fumble and later told the Australian radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1, that he could not imagine any worse start in his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happens now, you only take care of the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the cutter to his original debut in 2007, when a pass in his own in-Goal area led to a trial for Queensland.
Overall, however, it was a great experience for the 27-year-olds.
Hayne posted for a photo with fans and held an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss the rights of the people
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian battlefield with armed violence.
After he had openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company was beaten by Yukos and subjected to his democratic efforts.
Free voters demand the setting up of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria due to the high numbers of refugees.
Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW autumn class in Großwallstadt against a serious crisis at Bayern's Schools, if there are no new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapsing," said Aiwanger.
" Otherwise we will get rejected in the Bavarian education system."
The Land Day Group of the Free Voters will take place in the under-French municipality until Friday.
In fact, quite other main themes were envisaged.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Election Meeting.
"Of course, the topic of asylum will overcome the closure," Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as it did during the Yugoslavian war in the 1990s.
"That's not how it goes, we have to explain the reasons," said the Free Electoral Chief.
Rejected asylum seekers want to move free voters as quickly as possible.
Therefore, Aiwanger also requested more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum complaints: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW chief criticised that several federal states were not consistent: "We need uniform standards from the federal states across the country."
"Bayern's pulling away, others don't."
"That's where we need to become more operational."
However, country policy should not fall under the table in the capital city.
A long-term burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
In the new school year, Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) at 47 Gymnasia launched the pilot test "Middle level plus" in which an extension of the high school level is tested from three to four years - the result then takes nine years to Abitur.
But that's not far enough for Aiwanger.
"The G9 theme needs to be accelerated," said the FW Chief.
We demand freedom of choice for all high schools who want to do so.
Free ride at G9 wherever you want.
Faster Wall Street helps Dax jump

Infineon shares increased at the Dax peak by another 3.22 percent.
According to one trader, a positive report of the US investment magazine "Barron's" took effect from the weekend.
Consequently, investors paid too little attention to the German chipmaker.

4 people killed after police fire rubber gunfire on demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bullets in a number of people who protested against the proposed new constitution, an officer said on Wednesday.
The violence broke out in Rupandehi District on Tuesday night, about 175 miles west of the capital of Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, chief district officer, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before they came back on rubber bullets.
20 policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the used rubber bullets, known to kill, but traditionally used as less lethal alternatives, apparently produced such a high rate of death.
The dispute was the last of the weeks of violent protests in southern Nepal, where members of the ethnic group of Madhesi said that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Tharus who want a state of their own.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been involved in violent disputes since 10.
August was murdered when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial topic in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but the legislators have speeded up the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
This week, legislators have voted on certain clauses in the draft Constitution in Kathmandu and officials have said that the new Constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The property at the Emder Youth Centre Old Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meters area.
A mix of trade, commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market about 4,000 square meters of property in the immediate vicinity of the Old Post youth centre.
Preparations for this are currently under way.
It is planned to use the land for a mixture of trade, commerce and housing.
You wait for the corresponding offers, it's the city's name.
Which investor comes in question, don't know yet.
As a result, no contracts have yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had purchased part of the property located on the Ringstraße / Ecke Große street a few months ago and let the buildings on it be scrapped.
Project Hive: Details are available on the table
Plans for holiday home settlement at the small sea in Emden take shape.
The investor presented public plans for the project for the first time.
Several investors are still concerned - they fear the sale of their leisure refuge
For months after closed doors were negotiated, bullied, debated and signed.
Now there are plans for a new holiday home on the small sea near Emden on the table.
The interested medium-sized Emder company "System-Build" presented its plans to the city development committee of the Emder Council for the first time on Monday evening.
This item was originally on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from the project critic and the FDP Group, which challenged the investor and the administration of the secret creamery, Ralph Behrends went from the system-building business management to the offensive: "We haven't answered all the questions yet," he told Council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to be able to face all the rumors now.
The 10 to 12 million euro expensive projects have been under discussion for months.
Strong reactions among seamen who had come to the meeting called for the pictures and new details of the desired hotel building.
Roberto Schulz, owner of the sea and member of the board of directors, Pro Hyeve, claims: "This will be a huge bulwark that surpasses all other buildings".
He is also afraid, like several other project critics, that traffic by the intended size of the plant would increase strongly: "There must come all the busloads in order to calculate it," says Schulz
However, what is happening exactly on the well-hectare large area of the former guesthouse is still open.
There's no operator yet.
"We must have a final concept first," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the construction plans are still variable.
Two-year-olds at Gorillas in Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is happy to see the children at their gorillas.
The 26-year-old Diane brought twins to the world yesterday.
The births of twins are rare at Gorilla's.
The last one in a German zoo is almost 50 years back and has also been in Frankfurt since 1967, it is called the zoo.
The gender of the newborn gorilla's will was not established yet, since Mother Diana has kept her close to her body.
At first, the image had been reported.
NHC says 60 percent chance for cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands
The U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday a wide depth printing system of some 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verdean islands, which has a 60 percent chance to develop into a tropical vertebrate in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined deep-pressure system, for example, in the middle of the Cape Verde Islands and the small Antilles, also has a 60% potential to form a tropical vertebral storm in the next two days, added the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google launches a double donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a duplicate donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have been overwhelmed by the European nations, as they flee from war-torn and poor countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to announcing the donation call on its blog.
Instead of letting a manager announce, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experience.
"Our journey included many dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperate for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organisations providing help to refugees and migrants: doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said the first global donations up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugees will be doubled to $11 million.
Europe has been facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has evicted more than 4 million people this year.
Many also fled from the war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For mildly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data take a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, who wrote a guide to the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or adipositas surgery, using different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to consume food.
Over the years, adipositas operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have proven to be effective, but most studies have been conducted in people who are ill-fated with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain measure of weight in relation to size, is considered as normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight and people with over 30 BMI are considered fat.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compared two types of adipositis surgery - stomach bypass and stomach tube formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained with those who received non-surgical diabetes treatment at approximately 29 years of age.
Among those undergoing surgery, 36% of those with diabetes were fully and 28%.
In the medically treated group, diabetes was completely resolved only by one percent and in part by only about two percent.
In addition, the results of blood pressure, triglyceride and "bad" LDL cholesterol were "generally better in the "surgical" group", the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient blood level of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects the blood sugar levels over time.
Haemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
Following surgery, the average haemoglobin A1c decreased from approximately 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the medical treatment group it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycaemic control" - as you reflect in the improved hemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to leading researcher Dr. Chih-Ceng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compares average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight (18.7 vs 14.2 kg) compared to the gastrectomy group, achieved greater reductions in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs 2.1%) and reported a complete excess of diabetes (46.9% vs 16.7%).
While the new study does not show the survival benefit of surgery after five years, there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, Blackstone says from the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study it was possible to die about 29% less likely in a 15-year-old population who underwent an adipositas operation - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show any benefit to the survival of the surgical patients, Blackstone said it is comforting for people with a BMI of 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"That is the critical point of this study because she says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," she said, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have collected these genetic changes that have firmly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a conversion is really difficult."
Love story plays in the back
It is a subject that is now more noticeable in Belletristik: A young woman, unloved and unseemly at school, meets her youth's swarm again after years, and she falls in love with her.
So also in the recent novel "In fact we are not so" by Luisa Binder.
In addition to the love story, the novel should be particularly interesting for Hunsrücker readers, because it plays in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The chief professional author has grown up in Langweiler and is pleased that she could place a literary monument at her home.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not accommodate all refugees, Dalai Lama said and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan-Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which devotes itself to ethics studies.
He called for the interests of humanity to be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents under the circumstances.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was remarkable, but the situation was not appropriate.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama of Germany and Austria commended efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of thousands of refugees, but in the meantime you have to think about long-term solutions, how real peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to consider how the killing is reduced in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The use of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions following the terrorist attack of 11 September and stated that the violent reaction of the United States has attracted a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my policy in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem is in non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he resorted to violence, and that has caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the intake of hand-infection agents by children in the last 4 years
Drug control centres in the United States report an almost 400-percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age who swallow alcoholic hand infections, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of the intake of hand infections in children under 12 years of age reporting poison control centres increased from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"Children are increasingly coming to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them go into the emergency," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children deliberately drink disinfectants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mood test in the social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young disinfectants drink just because of a cheap experience.
Youths reportedly have mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouth water to obtain a stronger drink.
Younger children can be angeled by attractive fragrances of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape must and orange fragrance that are very suitable for children.
Hand-infectives contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in infants, few syringes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, director of the poison treatment center at the Kansas University Hospital, fax 4 in Kansas City.
So, you wouldn't let a blow of whisky around, but people let these hand disinfectants in the range of children, and when children come to it, then it's a quick way to consume lots of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken a hand-infection drug that smells like strawberry in school, was taken into emergency care.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179 times higher than the threshold that is legally applicable to an adult than drunk, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency nurse who treated her in the Winnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaiah laughed at her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen through alcohol and had hit her head, Ritchey said.
"That was very frightening," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use alcohol-free products or disinfectants and store hand infections outside the child’s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with fatalities.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after the slaughter of hand infections that included a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Employees of health authorities assume that the product contains methanol, a lethal solution, instead of ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three fourth-class students in New York State planned to poison their "common" teacher by exposing antibacterial products around the classroom," says a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand infections and banned them from her room.
The police considered the delayed plan to be "commitment" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwengingen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver was easily injured in an accident at the crossroads between the North Ring and the Herdens.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the cross-roads towards the industrial area and found too late that two previous vehicles had been stopped during the circuit.
As a result, he rolled his truck into the corner of an Audis and pushed this vehicle onto a front Ford Fiesta.
In the case of vehicles involved, damage caused by accidents occurred of around EUR 10,000, the police report.
The 33-year-old's audience was no longer ready to drive and had to be pulled out.
Noise Kitchen: No Disharmony at Celtic

Hearts will fight SFA because of neilson's indictment and Warburton will be cautious at January recommitments that could destroy the unit of the frame
Dons increase lead over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's Elfmeter in the first half gave Aberdeen a short victory over Hamilton in Pittofrie, so that the Dons create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays Greed over Disharmonic
There are rumors of a disagreement with Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously rejected by Griffiths. This was because he and his teammates were not under increased control, as they were preparing for the confrontation with the Dutch board leader.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in the Scottish football long-term Netherlands - de Boer
The former Ranger middle field player and former Dutch national player Ronald de Boer said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently a ambassador to Ajax, said, "In Holland they don't show the top points of Celtic games anymore and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here are not just talking about the returns of the Rangers.
They're talking about the old firm.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the old firm games, and it's not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm gonna turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deala has accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian chief swore to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League, the defeat against 10 men from Aberdeen, who are now clear at the top of the table with five points of lead.
But Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we'll be back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel exactly that way - but we have to move on.
We really need Celtic's support, because that makes the players better.
Now it's so important to get together.
Warburton Carefully at January Transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which indicated that he was pointing out some January transfers, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is cautious in signing new arrivals and insists that he does not want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox framework.
The former head of Brentford said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in the summer have this preseason time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target person Michu with withdrawal instructions
Swansea stormer Michu, with Celtic during the transfer period in the conversation, indicated that he could withdraw when his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been suing himself for two years with a painful jaw and has not managed to get out of Wales this summer.
Hearts on SFA Battle Set for Neilsson Comments
The hearts led 2:1, when Fatherson was sent from the field and then lost 3:2, but the Red Card of the Defender was later lifted - the third Red card of Collum, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson remains in what he has said, and continues: "I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance."
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastle
The irrevocable hibee was directed after he admitted to singing a song with offensive lyrics about Ex-Hearts Player Rudi Skacel.
The event took place in a cane in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh in front of an Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment," the stormer said, adding, "It's safe to say that I'm not going back to Tynacastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has trust in Dundee-United Management
Simon Donnelly insists that the board of Dundee United still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but says that the descent must end in the field.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We'll get the boys back to work," said Donnelly.
McInnes is happy to "get away with it" against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his team from Aberdeen had to struggle against Hamilton Acies desperately to see a seventh consecutive league victory, which brought them a five-point lead from Celtic to the top of the table thanks to Adam Rowey's Elfmeter in the first half.
McInnes said, "There is no team that has won everything, in bowling games or leagues that have not even won this kind of game."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while it is growing in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from 164,000 in May to July, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose from 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9% was higher than that of the UK of 5.5%, as shown by the figures of the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 70.0 per cent during the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
The Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundel commented on the latest figures and said: "The long-term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It is almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a reduction in unemployment.
Drunken disordered the course

Why I'm gonna be a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a later legal intervention, I'll see how a man is killed.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll be sitting in an observer gallery in the death chamber in Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation took place for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew closer, I began to fear myself.
So why should I?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists can see locations in the United States, and as there are often more applications available than places, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media spots from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected will watch it emotionally.
I can't.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like the guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of giving up my impartiality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it, and you get access.
I'm complaining about her.
She admitted that she "could have formulated it better", but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he would.
I told him he could get me out of his list of witnesses anytime.
But he wants an international reporter to be there to write there.
If he dies, he thinks the public work of the movement against the death penalty will help.
Kim Bellware, a reporter at the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I made.
I don't want to go back to all the details.
I can't say for sure Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I believe there is a strong likelihood that he is not guilty of the murder.
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his orientation is wrong.
And from this perspective, I'll see him die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to.
What you get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man after wet police pursuit convinces him to come from the Canning River
The Canning Valley police remained dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang the police was unsuccessful when he was in the cold and simmering water, only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "convince him gently to return to the shore."
The Canning Vale police were called to a peace break in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said 'I don't come out, come out and get me," said Senior Sergeant Tradel Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too excited to wet his uniform, so he turned to a more reliable tactic - "A good cop negotiated".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the mines to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired natives to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewarts tried to spy on him and threatened to end the race
Peter Moody claims that Stewarts of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his cities last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He aimed at the Stewarts and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they carried out a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai's Late Scratching due to a run-off treatment, the last strawhall on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he had always tried to do what was best for the race and had found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt diving test at Lidaris, which he could not explain.
He had stayed for 18 months because of the espionage proposals and did not want it to "look like too high-hanging grapes."
"I was going to say nothing about it, and I've been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out all at once," Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to go around the raised head, and I want my owners to think I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I'm not doing this, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
Then I have to think about what I'm doing with my license.
Before Moody had made the bomb go up in an interview with racing.com, that the integrity department had tried to spy out his stable.
" Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Daily Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - I'll call him when I'm asked - and offered him a job in my seats to deliver information about what I'm doing inside my seats," Moody said on Racing.com.
You obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, surely they should stick to their noses because they failed to catch me when trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of the RVL, David Moodie, President of the RVL and Bernard Soundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of it at the time and are still there today.
Should that make me think it's gonna be personal?
Has the RVL behaved weakly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe the people out there think I am.
Maybe they have to take my license and violate me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying is making them think about it now.
But now I'm at the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will exert pressure on them and force them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The trainer's frustration levels were built up with the long-standing cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the Late Scratching led him to say that he "can throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation of the unbeatable Master Black Caviar, described the race day treatment rule as "laughing" after a pack of sludge or ton was applied to the horse legs, which was against the rules.
"It's against the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
"One of my employees misbehaved badly on his leg.
It could have been like this last night.
It could have been like this all day yesterday, whatever it was.
But it was like that on the race day.
Moody could be faced with a three-month disqualification for the treatment with the packaging on the day of the race. An investigation of this matter has been opened.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all know we need rules, but here you have gone too far," Moody said.
Man arrested after a driver's escape
At the end of the week, the police arrested a man after a meeting with a bicycle driver and then a driver in Cobram.
The biker was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on a Saturday morning on the Murray Valley motorway.
The police said the driver continued without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia was appointed to the police in Shepparton.
He is likely to be charged for driver's flight and abandoned assistance and for other traffic offences.
The biker, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, stays in the hospital. He is in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy fights against rivals due to allegations of ring fights
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy has described criticism of his player's tackling as "Agenda-Setting" by two Premier League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters Trainer Trent Robinson said that the judges allowed the storm players "ringfighting" with his team during the high-storm victory at the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Broncos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a hardly hidden remark about the storm team after his team had won the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "example" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended the tack limb of his team and said that they were focused only on their "contact" during the tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches on his team was confidential because it meant that they were worried about being hit by the storm team.
"This is happening all the time - I haven't heard Trent Robinson talk about ring fights when they beat us at 24:2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defensive system or techniques all year round. But in the last six weeks, we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and this has brought us the trend.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train. So he's probably not used to losing it, so it was a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how this always shows up at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "long-term" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night and how exciting her game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St. George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he'd take care of it.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
That's the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like this.
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they're a little worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn't think of us when it was about the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roosters achieved a higher result than the Broncos against Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are pauses and no points of excitement?
For me, it's the game plans.
When they mention us, it means that we will still meet them in one phase.
The storm team is free on this weekend, as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks on the next Saturday in the AAMI Park. Ticket sales start on Tuesday morning.
Serbian with $200,000 bail on drug charges
A man who may have been threatened with a life sentence because of his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released against a $200,000 bond.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month, after the federal police found 100 kg of drugs on the yacht Solay, who came from South America over Vanuatu and placed in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed meeting his co-defendants at the yacht port during the morning and later at the Coomera Roadhouse Café, where the police found 40 kilograms of drugs in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially life-long penalty for the attempt to own a commercial quantity of cocaine, Maximovic’s lawyer argued that there is no evidence that he tried to own the entire quantity and that it could have been in the café for a shameless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of escape at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the case of the crime, he lied to the police about his place of residence.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather had offered a 200,000 dollar bail together as security to achieve his release.
"After reading the essential statements of the two parties, it is clear that the imposition of a $200,000 security is a real financial burden," Justice Flanagan said.
But that alone will not be enough to keep him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released against bail, under the conditions that he surrenders his Australian and Serbian passport, reports to the police every day and stays at an exit lock from 18:00-06:00.
Accident on A5 at Karlsruhe: the driver's house is tearing apart
A truck driver was seriously injured in a three-car accident at Karlsruhe on Tuesday night.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent building towards Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried unsuccessfully to leave at the last moment to the left, as the police reported.
The driver's house of the accident manufacturer was completely apart.
The driver was seriously injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Brussels Hall and Karlsruhe North was completely closed for six hours to 2 hours.
There was a damage of 122,000 euros.
Steven Hogg used the phone of girls to lure paedophile to send pictures
A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to demand images of child abuse.
Stefan Hogg took the girl's phone when he slept, logged into an online messaging service, from which he received a number of inappropriate images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping hogg.
She looked through it, found the confusing messages and immediately alarmed her mother.
The police took care of it and looked at the five images, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered "relevant" web searches that used the terms for looking for inappropriate images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done it because it would lead to "paedophile on the Internet" and then "pretend to be a cop to scare her".
State Attorney Elidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be a search - that he was anxious to scare people.
He admitted that the searches were carried out on the computer by him, but said it was because he claimed to be a cop to scare Pedophile.
He was asked after his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he was sick in the head when he was drinking, and he said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was at the table and at the table.
She also saw the inappropriate images on the phone and confronted the defendant.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and Playstation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, accused himself of having taken wrong images of children on 14 June last year, of having violated the charges on 25 January of this year and not of having appeared before the court for an hearing on 24 March of this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to appear in the register of sexual offenders, as one can argue that "no significant sexual element" was found in his crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael transferred the verdict until October to obtain background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but due to hearings with other cases still pending, it was kept under investigation.
He was included in the list of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment.
Switches to small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being picked up at the German-Austrian border, away from the major checkpoints.
Many lockers caused fear of detection and arrest to increase people at smaller border crossings
on the Austrian side out, a spokesperson of the Federal Police said.
Along the Inn border, more than 1,000 refugees have been attacked in the Passau and Rottal-Inn districts since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and dust guns.
There they are received by federal policemen and forwarded for registration.
At the Munich Main Station, according to the Bundespolicei figures, there were many more refugees in comparison to the beginning of the week on Wednesday.
By 8:00 p.m., about 700 people arrived in the capital, said one speaker in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls at the German-Austrian border, 1759 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday.
Stuttgart: Tropensturm "Henry" is expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn of storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to an area of deep pressure across Western Europe, the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart reported on the current warm sea air in the country.
The strong depth was the outcome of the "Henry" Tropensturm, which was pulled over the Atlantic by the Bermuda Islands in the past days.
Heavy storms and thunderstorms are expected in particular in Baden.
According to DWD it is still possible to count until Thursday morning in the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alb and in the bottom lake with curves of 60 to 90 hours.
Thus, on Friday, the sun can be seen for a longer time.
The mass makes it: Every two years the autobuilders show their news on the IAA.
2015 is particularly important for the compact cars, which are currently selling especially well.
Cars from the compact class are currently particularly asked: around 28.1 percent of the new permits were removed from the power station (KBA) in August alone on this segment.
This is also reflected in the IAA (Public Day 17-27 September).
Among all the futuristic concept vehicles and new top-class and luxury cars, many new compact models are presented this year.
One of the biggest premiers for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be in the fall with the dealers.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel Chief Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
It's part of the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to be sold well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive for this.
Opel provides an entrance below the largest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs 16 990 euros.
The Astra has a new 1.4 litre engine with 74 kW/100 PS.
In addition, the hens provide additional diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 PS to 147 kW/200 PS, which include for the first time drenchylinder benzenes.
Unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, there is only the Opel Astra as a five-firer.
As the second variant will follow the van in the spring, which is also visible on the IAA.
And what's going to happen next to the Astra on the IAA on new compact cars?
Renault Megane: Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Megane to the race.
At the fair the Mégane is seen exclusively as a five-doorer in a conventional and accentuated sportful GT version.
He'll be in the store at the beginning of next year, then also as a van.
Infiniti: The whole new segment is the Infiniti Q30.
The Nissan-Ableger wants to find its position in the strong growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti fully fits the design line of the brand with its curved lines.
The base model will get a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW/122 PS.
However, the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 PS or 125 kW/170 PS.
Suzuki Baleno: The new segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premieres in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1,0 litre turbo engine and a power of 82 kW/111 PS.
The maximum torque is based on manufacturer specifications at 170 Newton meters (Nm).
The start of the Baleno sale in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but refurbished around is the compact class model DS 4, which is visible on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble Citroën-Ableger were especially handy at the front: Here the refrigerator grill was redesigned and the modified headlamps were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system has been modernised, the number of buttons is reduced by a touch screen and the first time Apples CarPlay is integrated.
In addition, a series of revisions and new variants such as the updated Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI will be sent to the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five Square Meters Cells are undeservable
The Federal Constitutional Court authorized a former prisoner of the Tegel Court of Justice who had been detained in a small cell for months.
Because of the violation of their dignity, prisoners are basically entitled to financial compensation when they are placed in small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, even if they had only a few days in the closed rooms, they could hope for money (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
This led to the success of a former prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: He was placed in the Berlin Tegel Judicial Institute between June and November 2009 in a single cell with a surface area of about five square meters; the toilet was not separated.
After that, the man who was told by his lawyer was now on his free foot again was moved into a larger cell.
His appeal against the undeclared conditions of detention against the land of Berlin failed.
However, the Constitutional Courts raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber and referred the case back to the re-examination.
You see the dignity of man hurt.
Court of Justice now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if for legal reasons of the period in question only a few days were relevant for compensation, if a claim was made, it was said.
Otherwise, it would be "a concern for the legal protection of the person".
The Court of Justice now has to clarify the amount of the damages.
In the past, constitutional courts have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
That's how they told a prisoner in April about the damage he was doing because he was naked in a cell.
Human dignity is a decision of 2011 according to also the multiple coating of a cell without separate toilet.
In addition, Karlsruhe confirmed on Wednesday, in addition to the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009.
The plaintiff then spent over three months daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruher case.
The Berlin prisons have also come to the strike in recent weeks because of the lack of staff.
That is why prisoners are repeatedly imprisoned for 23 hours, which increases aggressiveness, even to beatings, due to the tense situation.
21 seats in Tegel are not occupied due to the lack of access to justice, 19 will be lost in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the Refugee Policy: "We create this"
Immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What's going on in Germany?
Around 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to Deputy Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) Germany is even able to accommodate a million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can do this, and we can do it."
What comes to Germany is the following overview.
It is used according to different forecasts between 350000 (estimation of the Federal Tree Ministry) and 400000 (estimation of the Pestel Institute) apartments annually - and for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as it has been built so far (250000 apartments).
But the lack of housing is dramatic, especially in the case of affordable rentals: 60000 to 80000 social apartments fall out of the rental price bond annually, and refugees will also apply for these particularly affordable apartments.
Federal Building Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding, from now 518 million to a billion euros.
In the view of the Pestel Institute, too little is this: 80,000 social housings had to be created annually and the federal government had to invest a funding of 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and Federal Building Minister agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Labour Market and Vocational Research, 55 per cent of refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them when entering, Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, it is crucial for the integration of refugees to find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, to value in the receiving society, but also to the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Tränhardt.
In Germany, according to Tränhardt, there was a political turnaround: from the labour ban for refugees to recognition of work.
While previously there was a labour ban on asylum seekers from up to five years old, it was reduced to three months in November 2014 as well as the residence obligation that the asylum seekers were limited to a place of residence.
In society, too, because of the lack of expertise, most of the way in which refugees should be made more accessible to the labour market has been implemented.
A great obstacle to accessing the labour market is lack of German knowledge.
There is not yet sufficient supply of general and professional language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most often communicated by personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore in the opinion of Tränhardt the Königsweg for labour integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few refugee parents give their children to the Kitas, estimated 10 to 15 percent: "It is only very important for the parents to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
However, to convince the family of the benefits of Kita, the administration distributes handsets in different languages.
Should the need for educators rise strongly through the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the educational capacity - for example by allowing more vocational schools.
In the countries, students are prepared for teaching without German knowledge in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a secondary language.
They have no shortage, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin School Administration.
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study.
In principle, no German country prohibits the study of asylum applicants or patients - the only exception was until Berlin, Interior Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his position.
Student refugees could be facilitated access to the university.
Because refugees with a residence permit or a residence permit are no longer granted benefits under the Asylum Application Performance Act when they start a study.
The latter do not, in principle, receive a derogation as they do not fall within the circle of the eligible persons.
Patienced refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years in order to be eligible for Bafög, from 1 January 2016 this span is reduced to 15 months.
However, this funding gap must also be closed, Steffen Krach, State Secretary for Science, Berlin, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
The students should be immediately informed.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should successively grant Islam the same rights as the churches and further develop the existing state-church law into a new state-religious relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic Welfare Association, which is professionally responsible for the new arrivals.
Rights also include obligations.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree and be willing to cooperate with the State in many areas and allow it certain control options.
This includes the willingness to take action against religious fundamentalism.
The President of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday, religious conflicts could also be introduced into Germany.
Those who wanted to exacerbate such conflicts in Germany "have immediately their right to rest here, in Germany," he said in Bavarian radio.
He proposed translating the basic law into Arabic.
Integration will be much more than today as a topic of society as a whole.
This will also require the change of majority society, which will make the elimination of discrimination and racism more urgent.
Germany, as a result of European decisions, has, for a short time, an anti-discrimination centre and a general equality law.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and interest groups of non-white Germans have been demanding for a long time and what international agreements, such as the anti-racism convention in Germany, will have to become a reality in the coming years when the country remains peaceful and its new citizens will take advantage of their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany has been able to provide the expected medical care for refugees, says physician President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As far as man-power and capacity are concerned, we will create it," he told the mirror.
However, additional money had to be flown into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery calls for all arrivals to hand out health cards at the time of registration.
The benefits provided could be calculated later with the Federal countries.
And in the long run, it is highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited catalogue of performances provided for by the Law on Asylum.
Otherwise, the doctors mainly create language barriers.
Even so, as the Berlin Health scientist Thea Borde has shown, migrants are less likely to be diagnosed with their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical practice, interpreters had to be taken over, she demands.
Many refugees would also be helped with more general medical applications in emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and among young people it is HIV clearance.
With the partly other disease images, German doctors come out of their training clearly, says Montgomery.
"Parasite attack or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect."And as far as the medical shortage is concerned, it is possible that the refugees may even be relieved in sight.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, some refugees were even doctors.
In order to be able to practice, however, they had to prove their qualifications and perhaps re-evaluate tests.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates of the Federal Psychotherapy Chamber (BPtK): Most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Especially vulnerable are refugee children, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recently published study by TU Munich shows that every five Syrian refugee children are traumatized in Germany.
Those who have a post-traumatic load disorder suffer from, among other things, so-called flashbacks with breath, dizziness, heart rate and death anxiety.
Other symptoms are sleep and concentration disorders, strong fearlessness and emotional numbness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from being chronic, early treatment was necessary, Munz explained.
To date, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although psychologically ill asylum seekers may apply for psychotherapy in the social offices, the treatment usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social offices, most professionals or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to lack of estimates, says Munz.
Many invite to dream
With the new stage "Treaty" the Circus Probst returns to the traditions of circus art.
The aim is to attract every age group into the band of fascinating acrobatics, animal clothing and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites into the plenty on the brick what to dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior chief.
"Leading" - under this motto is the current man-made scene.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the family Probst.
So the gift of enthusiasm is in the blood.
"It is important for us to get people out of their day-to-day struggle and take them to a completely different world for two hours," says the 27-year-old Junior Chief.
"Manegencocktail with World City-Flair", says Director Reinhard Probst.
50 cities on the almost 3,000 km long tour can now experience this flair.
The circus program convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family attracts the audience with jokes and charms in their banner.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their work.
With the heroes of the silent movies, it wants to take the Cuban duo casually.
Easyness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Their humorous art on the mast is to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
Apart from numerous salmon salts, the acrobatics of the Circus sample also fascinate with fingertips and softness.
Balance with the one-wheel on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snake people fascinate and scare at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics as little other and fascinated by their movement.
60 Employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," says Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Disadvantages in the behaviour of circuses are only too often a matter for various animal protection organisations.
Stephanie Sample also says: "If it is not good for our animals, it is not good for us."
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each strike unit.
The "four-legged artists", as they are lovingly called, will be read out of the eyes as soon as possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel well, it doesn't want to get into the crowd either.
So the top command: take good care of the animals.
Especially on her Zebraid Jumbo, a mixture from a ShetlandPony hamster and a zebra hamster, the family Probst is proud.
The two animals have lived together for eight years and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is not ready for the crowd yet, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
So there should be something for each visitor.
"One is safe," says Stephanie Probst: "Whether there are five or 1,200 spectators, we always give our best and are with all our heart."
The Circus Probst invites every day from 17 to 20 September at 5 p.m. and 20 p.m.
On Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.
Thursday is a family day, the prices are reduced for the performance at 5 p.m.
In addition, the animal show is open every day from 10 to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe is making the wrong speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs from the beginning of the year by a podium.
He remained unharmed, but the video of the case spread rapidly over the social media.
The opening of Parliament was also prompted by statements by opposition Members that they had received anonymous death threats and had been warned to accompany Mr Mugabe's call with his neighbors.
Last month they had blown him up and interrupted him during his speech to the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The speaker of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians had received SMS messages on their phones, which they had warned about disrupting Mr. Mugabe's claim.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Death'," he told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members concerned that the immunity in Parliament ends, and as soon as they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesperson said that the party led by Morgan Tsangirai was "anxious" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and savings efforts in the company's services.
HP will later be divided into two listed companies later this year and separate computer and printer business from its faster growing company hardware and service business.
The expected loss of jobs leads to over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, said HP in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP President and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be more and less focused than HP today, and we have a broad and deeper portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better equipped than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion of annual turnover and "will be focused on providing unattainable, integrated technology solutions for companies so far", said a company statement.
It divided a company founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical equipment and called their Palo Alto Garage "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone massive restructuring to cope with the diversion of traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The measure of HP, the world's second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US technology companies, is the latest in this area, which is based on the belief that closely focused companies provide a better performance.
FC Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must stand behind the injured Jack Wilsher before the game against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation was planned, there was no reason why he could not play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilsher will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and, in view of its history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is still uncertain.
The great shame in this current problem is that Wilsher had finished the last season after a separate knee injury and had returned to his old swing during the previous season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten your career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that doesn't heal well.
That's no big deal.
It was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or to the injuries he had previously suffered.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injuries, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The study of Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different diseases of Wilsher since his debut six years ago.
He also played in just 65 of Arsenals 157 league games in the last five times.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that in six of eight times since 2007/08 they were one of the two Premier League Clubs that have most days of injuries.
Wenger accepts the potential of a hell cycle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will take place during the last season.
"Sometimes when you return from an injury, you have an offensive period, a time when you have to strengthen your body and win the battle," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm confident he'll do it and he'll go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on the coming Wednesday, and Wenger launches a rotation within the team.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey are not traveling to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Montreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and the players who need it to get a little break," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is clear favorites to continue through Group F, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is one of Europe's largest intimidating venues.
Dynamo is also unbeatable after 41 games, after the "invincible" campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium was rocked by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measuring 3.2 on the judicial scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Werger believes that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from the last season with the Champions League's Capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the association to its first European post-war triumph with its management.
"This drive is huge," Wenger said.
It's never hit Arsenal before.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I am long enough in the business to be realistic.
We're jealous, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the Comedy show that gives us serious lessons about human friendships
The lack of similar performances in shows is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up now has become even more desperate than ever before, how suicide killings among young men on a 15-year-old height prove.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death for men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and it remains three times more common for men than for women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - campaign against a pitiful life) announced 2015 as the year of man, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is the heartpiece in the struggle to master this challenge.
A current study in more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "soundness of mind", his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of healthy friends halfs the risks of mental problems.
But of course you have to have friends first so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media communication, with its focus on substance style, the immediate response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, lively and successful, even though in reality the isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship, which has a far deeper effect on our spiritual health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can't buy happiness.
The beauty of friends was that this focus was placed on the head.
Each character was defined, not by his work, but by his personality, which shined through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments at football games in cozy seats and Ross' desire for Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can refer to it in any case, even though they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As an employee of the phone-soul care explained to me: ... "My role as a listener to people who are depressed and at risk of suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old saying "I'm right with it" has an enormous effect, like the feeling that it's perceived as weakness when you talk openly about problems."
Friends is one of the shows that makes sense to me when I try to offer longer-term management mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of friendship between men.
So much my objective external status through the phone can also help people in times of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you visit this weekend's Comedy Central FriendsFest with the completely redesigned cupboard at the festival of the day, why not take your friends to a drink in Central Perk.
Or even better, if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from beginning to end - all 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his encounter with Malmö.
Di Maria meets with his debut at the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to pass through Malmö.
Here are the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani took a course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at Prince Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Debüts as a PSG player who led the French champion, but then they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when Cavani achieved a headball in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Doneck also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they not only strive to qualify for the K.O. rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But as they got the points, there was no class game by Laurent Blancs team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed opportunities before the gate. He was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the association with which he started his illustrative career already in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League. Therefore it is a good start to win 2:0 to cause our opponents problems and relax, even though there are certain things we still have to perfect in the course of the season," Blanc said.
"That's a good sign.
We wanted to win, and we won, although I regret that we have not yet reached one or two more doors."
After his injury, Ibrahimovic returned to one of three changes to the Paris team, which on the weekend could hold a 2:2 indisputably against Bordeaux in the First League, but he was expelled in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine air storm was called the man who could take the PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United, and he indicated why when he entered Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmo defense before he ended up at Johan Wiland nicely in the long corner of the network.
However, if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, it was disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this level, came on the field with nine national players at Anpiff and was with a five-man defense and two deep down in the middle.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who was far away from Kevin Trapps Pfosten in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG itself sometimes gave up, with some missteps and bad conclusions, not least by Ibrahimovic, who, in no less than five attempts, was put into the first half alone and then abandoned after Cavani had used him after restarting him.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into play, and it was a pass by Ibrahimovic who turned Di Maria into a turn shot, which was transferred by Wiland in the 52th minute at the Post ...
The second gate finally fell shortly after the watch brand thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan achieved its sixth seasoner, after Ibrahimovic had caught a left flank from Maxwell.
This ended all the thoughts that Malmö could return to the game, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the outcome down before replacement player Ezequiel Lavezzi was finally recognized as a gate.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class about his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was last December.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
The qualification games are not enough."
Get out of front of Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion for stock sales
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, which is affected by rising commodity prices, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a stock sale as part of its huge debt recovery plan.
The company Glencore registered in London said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off its own debts.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices, as China's economic downturn is pushing demand and has a devastating impact on markets.
The issue of reference rights led Glencore to a rapid increase in stock exchange prices in the early Wednesday morning trade.
The share jumped by 2.77 percent to 131.60 Pence on the FTSE 100 Index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had announced $2.5 billion in stock sales last week as part of the more comprehensive plans to raise some one third of his $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares to 125 Pence per share, which meant a 2.4% discount on the final price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares in the value of up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Considering long-term inhibited growth in China, iron prices have been reduced by about half, coal, copper and other raw materials prices have decreased by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar after a long escape.
The refugees are from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xis' first official in Washington, takes place on 25 September and sends President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
The US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also be the host of Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan this evening at a state dinner after the two leaders have held bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will offer the opportunity to expand US-Chinese cooperation on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to address areas of opinion diversity constructively," the statement adds.
XI, whose visit was first announced in February, is likely to meet several US technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before going to New York City to attend the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concerns about alleged cyber espionage of China and its growing self-consciousness in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.
Lend 440 PS sports cars and drove to trash
A 29-year-old wanted to fulfill a dream and borrowed a Ford Mustang.
On the rainy highway the evil woke up.
With a company in the Gotha district, you can fulfill your dream and borrow and drive a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 PS.
So did a 29-year-old from Gotha County.
On the A 71 at Arnstadt, the dream was then gone and gone.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, drove on a wet track into the Schleuders and drove to the driving board.
The sports car suffered total damage, no one was injured.
The damage is estimated at EUR 40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 Switching to FC Bayern
World and European Master Xavi has been playing since summer 2015 for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar
The FC Bayern apparently stood a few years ago before Spain's commitment to Superstar Xavi, who was playing for the FC Barcelona.
Eight times Spanish champions, three times Pokal winners, four times Champions League winners, two times World Club champions, two times European champions, one time World champion - the title list of Xavi is stunning.
In the summer, the 35-year-old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar.
However, in an interview with the Marca, Xavi now tells us that he was already in front of the EM 2008 before leaving Barcelona.
"You told me Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything at the time, we didn't," he says.
And that was also recorded by the FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bayern."
"Rummenge wanted me."
To remember: In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't change
But the change didn't stop.
And the decisive man today works for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça has contracted Guardiola and I have played a great EM."
"Pep told me that I wouldn't change that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"That's how he got me."
Who knows how Bayern's playtime 2008/2009 would have run with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca at the quarter final of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the entire distance on the race, turned off the Red (4:0, 1:1) and finally celebrated the Royal Class Triumph.
Matt Damon plays diversity in film creation down
Matt Damon faced African American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said that they won't be needed behind the scenes.
During a sequence of Sunday Night by HBOs Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown interrupted when he stressed the need for alternative perspectives regarding a black protagonist in the selected spinbook of the project.
"When we talk about diversity, you do it when you film and not when you film," said Damon.
Brown reacted shocked, with a politicized disbelief and called "Hoo! Wow. Okay", when the actor's comments of The Martian got stuck.
Damon and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I want to encourage people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of harmony," Brown said first.
The only black person, and she is a benefit that will be beaten by her white holder.
The producer of Dear White People took advantage of the finalists Leo Angelos and Christian Brancaccio for the director's rights in the film; Damon pointed out that their director could "at the end give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was sparked, the social media exploded before misbehaving about Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr. Pooni expressed his anger at the clip by writing "Matt Damon talks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's SO WEISS that it hurts".
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its publication.
Damon's comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the top of the social debate.
After being killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement achieved national effect and forced legislators and authorities to offer discriminatory practices against colour content.
In February, the singer Prince made a presentation on the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums silent matter", (Albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black life, albums still have their meaning.
In more recent times, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have published a statement, in response to the question of the Fox-News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be viewed as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a love group," the leaders said.
Recently it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or had already met the pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first Champion
Professional sports climber and support Isaac Caldiero was the first athlete who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took the big price of $1 million home.
The competition show, which just ended its seventh season, had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course.
During the season's final, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, arrived at the final.
The last task was to climb on a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten completed the task within the time he was the first athlete to complete the demanding phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero finished this challenge full of three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke with E!News after the hard win, still under the shock of winning the Great Price of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $10,000 or had to live," said Isaac E! about his pile of money.
All of a sudden, like I can't even imagine what the future is like.
The leading producer Kent Weed set up with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten, although he was the first to finish the course at all, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there's more than one finalist, it gets it with the fastest time," Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful price and life changes, it gets the great gratification.
I don't think he's got a grip on it.
He's just as happy to have done what he did.
Lots of awards he got from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He's a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had changed the roles.
America Ninja Warrior was extended for an eighth staff, which will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers Swallow on Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly fun for Detroit Tigers.
Previously they were one of the best teams in baseball, today the tigers are in the last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as Spoiler, but this part played perfectly against the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday with 5-4 in the Target Field.
The Twins wasted a chance to ascend within half of Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard Square.
For Detroit, although only for one evening, it was a return of the three letters F-word, which was so difficult to capture over a large part of the second half of the season.
"Every victory is fun, no matter how it comes," said Tigers Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitch Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine parties.
"I want to end this year strongly," said Simon.
It's hard to throw every game in the bullpen, and that's why I want to go completely focused into the game.
The designated Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBI since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swung the wood well," said Ausmus.
He looked well out of the (whispering), looked much better out in the bullpen, and he brought it directly into play.
With three runs in the meeting at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance of getting back into play.
Center Field Byron Buxton ended the inning with a double on the left line.
Right Field Aaron Hicks reached a color, and Simon brought his second Baseman Brian Dozier to strikeout before being replaced by his left hand Blaine Hardy.
Hardy survived the wall, the only man he was confronted, before the appointed Rookie-Schlagmann Miguel Sano, who entered a two-run into the right hand of Drew Verhagen.
With a couple of runners and the final run at the second pleasure brought the third Baseman Trevor plouffe to a Double Play.
It was the first 27 times in the Major League this season that a double play hit.
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, Waller created an RBI double against the Tigers' locker Bruce Rondon and reached the state of 5-4.
The right hand, however, stretched out Sano at three pitches for his fifth rescue.
Detroit benefited from the launch of the game by a still non-moveable Phil Hughes.
The tigers achieved three runs in the first two innings against the right-hand veteran who had been removed from the victim list before the game, after having missed more than a month due to a back pain.
" Obviously not the beginning that I wanted," said Hughes, "but I felt better when I released and felt that I would create some pretty good Pitches there in the third inning."
After receiving the leadoff bottle in the first place, Hushes gave up a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into play, who created a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez created his 0-21 success series with the runners in the score position.
The third Baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, created another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers added in the second, they achieved one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single by Center Field Anthony Gose for 3-0.
"It was a great blow," said Twins-Manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he got the right place.
Hughes was in a pitch-count, achieved no points in the third inning before being replaced by the reliefr's right hand A.J.
In Hughes, there were three runs at six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
COMMENTS: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez separated due to an injury to the throw shoulder.
He is studied by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the wounded list due to a fall of shoulders, is to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez from the game, LHP Daniel Morris is deleted from the wounded list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four beginnings with the tigers since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30th
He's been missing since August 20th due to a fracture in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will finish their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hessen.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people involved in it are then to be accommodated in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday.
She counted with 450 to 750 arriving refugees.
Several sports stadiums in the Hessian capital had been prepared in the past days for this case.
Up to 1,000 refugees can be temporarily displaced there.
They should then be further distributed to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, according to the Government Bureau responsible for the first adoption, 7,500 people had arrived in Hessen.
Frankfurt and Hanoi have also been set up in sports resorts due to the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military measures in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria to be an option.
"I believe that the determined thought about military action options must not take place without Germany," he said.
He called on the European states to "collective vision".
Four years ago, it was a pleasure to see the Kelch of military involvement in Germany passed.
"Now the conflict is crashing in front of our door," he said in German radio.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive rise in international aid for refugees.
Austria controlled at southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF, no one will be sent back to Hungary.
Germany has also sent no refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's so agreed," she said.
On the question of an agreement, after which Germany could accept a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said that there had already been discussions between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not call specific numbers and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Your goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU and government leaders, requested a special summit next week.
Germany had started temporary border controls on Sunday.
So far, the EU States have not been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis.
On Tuesday (September 22nd), EU Interior Ministers intend to launch a new call for the mandatory distribution of another 120,000 refugees at a special meeting.
In view of the strong refugee movement in Germany, the Federal Republic wants to strengthen its support for the first and most widely distributed countries.
The Federation will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced on late Tuesday after almost four hours of consultations with the Prime Minister in the Office of the Officials of Berlin.
Mark underlines that those who need protection fight them too.
However, those who do not have a living perspective cannot remain in Germany.
This view was clearly shared in the round.
The chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now had to cope with a "big effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are currently stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed its 175-km border to Serbia on Tuesday night.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania should also be removed with a toothbrush.
This neighbouring country belongs to the EU, unlike Serbia.
Hungary wants to prevent Drager from looking for alternative routes across Romania, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szyjjarto said to the planned new border zone.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut their teeth.
In Turkey, thousands of other migrants were then on their way to the Greek border, according to eyewitness reports.
Space probe "Cassini" finds Ocean on Saturnmond Enceledus
Under the ice panzer of the Saturn Moon, Enceledus is sinking into a global ocean.
That concludes researchers from observations of the Space probe "Cassini".
The moon then floats easily on its train around the ring planets.
Although this tidal movement is only small, yet too large for an increasingly solid body of heaven, it is said in a communication from the Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, from Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the "Icarus" section.
It has been known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
This is how "Cassini" had already discovered 2006 ice volcanos at the south pole of the Saturn Moon, which sprays water vapour and ice particles, thus feeding the so-called e-ring of the Saturn.
At least at the South Pole there had to be an underground sea, the astronomers then closed.
However, the extent of the hidden ocean has not been clarified.
Rama is missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich has to give up about a month on the Offensive Actor Valdet Rama.
An investigation has resulted in an adjudication injury at the age of 27, the association informed.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Munich Lions, the diagnosis means "probably four weeks' forced break".
"That's hard for us, Rama is a huge loss."
"Of course, we need to think about it now," said sports director Necat Aygün of the "Image" time with a view to the possible obligation of an inclusive profession.
As a training guest, however, the 60s initially presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoye Cale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at the VfL Wolfsburg.
Croatia currently has "the opportunity to demonstrate its capabilities".
Torjäger Rubin Okotie can return to team training next week after his brain failure.
Already on Thursday, the Austrian national player is scheduled to enter the exercise.
Okotie had injured himself in the party at Fortune Düsseldorf (0:3) during a severe encounter with the head.
But against the first fears, he remained without a serious blasur.
No diet fruit - Mangos contain a lot of sugar
Mangos are exotic and sweet.
But whoever wants to keep an eye on his sleek line will often be advised.
Because Mangos contain relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
However, the exotic fruits are healthy: they contain vitamins B and vitamins E and C. But most of all, Mangos contains a lot of vitamin A and its pre-stage beta-carotene.
So whoever eats the fruit supports visual power, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying Mangos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smoke.
The shell color alone does not tell you how ripe the fruit is - so green mangos can also taste very delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or sweet food.
A mango, however, also gives loving courts a special note.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, birds, lamb and wild.
The U.S. Packet Service UPS provides up to 95000 grants for Christmas business in the United States.
The company had already begun recruiting seasonal workers, UPS announced on Tuesday.
First of all, drivers are being searched.
Already last year, UPS had increased its crew for the holiday season by 95000.
In view of the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx met earlier years to be armed for the Christmas business.
Late deliveries in 2013 had brought harsh criticism to the package services.
First Föhnstorm, then marked cold front
In the coming night, in the valleys of the Alpine side of the Föhn, it breaks through, as Meteoschweiz announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and in the night until Thursday, the Föhn partly blows with storm strength through the Föhntals.
After festering on Thursday morning, we cross a marked cold front that brings strong rainfalls, wind waves and a temperature drop.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of a vast depth of print area across the British islands in a strong southwest stream.
On the north side, at night, the Föhn breaks through the valleys on Wednesday afternoon.
As a result, the Föhn continues to be in the Föhntalars with curves from 60 to 100 km/h, isolated and especially in the Urnerland, partly also with more than 100 km/h.
On the other hand, the Fowen can advance to the neighbouring Mediterranean country, and even on the mountains the Orcanoes of over 120 km/h are possible.
While in the north on Wednesday the stormy Föhn provides summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, the humidity begins to fluctuate at the alpensüdhang.
Here is where rain stops until Thursday night.
In sum, the Alps in the next 48 hours will have to be calculated in the south with partially more than 100 litres of rain per square metre, after which large amounts of rain have already fallen in the last days.
On Thursday morning, the Föhn will blow out the air, resulting in a cold front with strong, partly scattered rain from west to east over Switzerland.
Together with the cold front, the wind cools strongly up to the storm, and the temperatures are clearly falling back.
The following days are presented in the north in autumn with 15 to 20 degrees, whereas in the south it will become sunny and warmer at weekend with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of President Ignazio Marino, a nameless place in the park on the oppio hill was baptized on Wednesday on behalf of the German Reformer.
At the "Piazza Martin Luthero" he is now regarded as "German theologian of the Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The nomination was requested by the working community of the Evangelical Churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran community in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that Protestants in the city of the popes over centuries could often live only in the hidden faith as a minority.
With the place, it will be symbolically visible that their tradition of Christian faith has been welcomed to Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) was a young Augustiner Mönch in Rome for a few months.
At that time he felt the city as a broken sin drum.
His negative impressions may have strengthened him according to historians in his later struggle against Rome.
Luther then had initiated the division of the evening church with his thesis against the abstinence trade.
Hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) crown is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
At the beginning was the word?
No, not in the Otmar Old Bible, which has now appeared with beautiful images.
At the beginning was the image for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretations of Bible stories on paper and canvas.
Its "language" with colourful colors and fantastic shapes has been received by the 75-year-old - but it is not as important with "smiley" images.
On the contrary: adapted to each subject, this may seem quite dark.
About three years ago, Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project, for which he made a subjective artistic selection from the many topics of the "Book of All Books".
Founded are cycles that devote themselves to such themes as crossroads, plagues, commandments or fathers.
In this way he has spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther publisher with his theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publisher with his focus on art books.
And there is especially the author Klaus Altepost, who based his painting on the respective Bible sites.
He interpreted the Bible sites chosen by Otmar Old and thus "translated" in today's context.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible dating of Martin Luther and a set of the artist, who here formulates his very personal thoughts about the situation.
The jewelry belt has gold letters.
Thus the 75-year-old allows twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high degree of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately triggers for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant order of gentlemen.
"That's where the education happened with the pipestock," recalls Otmar Alt.
"I've tried to work on this, so maybe I can get back together with Mr. Father."
His second concern was to help art again in a fast-paced time to more value: "The perception of image worlds today is characterized by advertising, and that is loud.
Symbolism is being forced.
Artists have another desire and desire to show things.
Images always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to be "infallible" in the images, to let them work on themselves, to discover and feel what strength they have: "The image is looking for its opposite."
Klaus Altepost was present on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar Old Bible in the Otmar Old Foundation, "always" being a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures".
Old people did not take the Bible to heart, but they chose the subjects that mattered to them.
"It was not cooperation at eye height," says Altepost: "Here are the pictures that the text explains only." It was a picture Bible.
For Hans Möhler of Luther's publishing, this work is an invitation to "increase his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alts images speak for painters both the (bible) language of love and the responsibility.
Part of the original - paper and canvas paintings - is presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November at the Otmar Old Foundation.
Construction start for BMX track near
Plans made, space found, company commissioned, earthquake modeled for a round course: A year later almost everything was finished - but still before the official opening of the BMX train was finished again.
Failures in politics and administration provided for Verdruss, especially among the inhabitants who did not want to tolerate the train.
So the hills shifted, new space sought - now with formal planning and application for construction approval.
In October, Sabine Mosbach-Bock was now able to notify the Committee on Children and Youth.
"I hope this year is still visible," she said.
It should then start with the works in the former hall bathroom without "larger memory break".
DFB intensified engagement for refugees
The DFB extends its commitment to refugees until 2019, the Bundesliga sets out a clear sign at the weekend.
The football reacts to the situation in Germany and the policy ensures its help in dealing with the problems ahead.
"I consider this to be the greatest challenge in our country since the reunification."
"No one can say that in principle, it's nothing to me, I have nothing to do with it."
"It must interest everyone to get this issue into the grip," said DFB-Chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
At an annual meeting with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I'm in the office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Özoğuz and the Chancellor."
"There will certainly play a central role," he announced.
The football can and will help.
But the decisive shifts must be the policy.
The German Football Federation has therefore extended its "1:0 for a welcome" initiative for four years.
"On the Egidius Brown Foundation, we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019," Niersbach said at the edge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some federal lists also support this programme.
Already at this weekend, the 36 professionals put a clear sign when they are wearing the impression "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left tricotermal instead of the other common sponsor logo (hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only," said Leverkusen's sports chief Rudi Völler of the "Picture" (Tuesday) and described the project as "self-understanding".
"The refugee drama goes on everyone who can't go away."
"We can, no, we need to use our radiation power, our influence and our opportunities to help many of the refugees who have already suffered so incredible," said Hertha-Manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's CEO Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the League".
On Friday, the National Team of Women invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale to the EM Qualifications Game against Hungary.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a great community work of German football".
The fact that all 36 licensing associations had started their own projects in their places is great.
It is just as great that smaller and smaller associations are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome", which we have published, is lived in football.
"That is of enormous importance," he said.
This year and the next year, the Association will make available, together with the DFB and the Federal Government, 300,000 euros for the integration of refugees.
"The associations have already called the full sum for 2015," Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP head loses one eye in accident
The chief executive of Europe's largest software group, Bill McDermott, reportedly lost his left eye through a crash at the beginning of July.
In the case of an accident on the stairs in his brother's house in the United States, he fell on a glass of water after midnight, which he carried in his left hand, reported the "Week of Economics" on Wednesday.
"He was almost bled, he was powerless, then pulled out on the street - that's how he told us last week," says the "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
But McDermott could follow his work.
"In early October we will meet before the supervisory board meeting in Walldorf," Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager is at the meeting and is "full of work".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutschen Zeitung", he will return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group.
"I'm full for SAP, full of my job."
"Of course, I have been in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Hasso Plattner," said McDermott of the "SZ".
McDermott usually hangs between Germany and the USA, but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP centre in Walldorf.
It was important for him to go to the public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said: "Everyone can do something like that."
"It's important to get up again when you fall."
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen other than fighting ...
Magnussen tweeted a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was hit by the wheel.
Therefore, he comes as little as a reserve driver for the two stamp pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button in Singapore at the weekend, as one week later at Japan's Grand Prix.
Football: BVB without giants against Krasnodar: field in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes of a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have been finally crushed.
The national player will also miss the table leader of the Football Bundesliga in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19:00 p.m./Sky).
"We can't take it back," Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back on Sunday at the Bundesliga summit against Leverkusen, the BVB coach said: "We expect a return from him to training on Friday".
Given the high load of his profession, Tuchel will not only change his stamina on the giant position.
So he announced a change in the tortoise position.
This is why Roman Weidenfelder takes the place of the tribekeeper Roman Bürki.
"He trains at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether weed fields will be used in the future in all European League games, however, Tuchel opened up.
With high probability he will also fight the second party.
The research statement by complicator Reus that the final entry for the BVB in the Europe League should be the goal, media player Julian Weigl considers it to be feasible to say, "Marco is not so wrong."
"I think we have a good chance to take the title."
Robotic cars: Government wants to prepare roles for Germany
Germany is to be a technological frontier to the change of the car, according to the will of the Federal Government.
The Federal Cabinet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the IAA Auto fair's edge of a "new mobility age".
The automated and networked driving will increase traffic safety and ensure that there is less supply, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G7 countries, who also meet with representatives of industry at the IAA.
The Department of Transport's strategy paper highlights, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a gradual rise in digital broadcasting.
In order to test new techniques, a test track is currently taking place on motorway 9 in Bayern.
In order to "no additional liability risks" for the driver, the Federal Government wants to "check the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments".
Thus, Germany intends to make an international effort to raise the maximum speed for self-propelled cars from 10 to 130 hours.
The Federal Government also intends to make use of an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
In automated driving, the car increasingly takes over the driving, the driver becomes more and more passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
After a study submitted by the Ministry of Economics, high-tech automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, unmanned vehicles on public roads were "to be expected long after 2020".
The value creation in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the location Germany estimates the authors of the study for 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros.
"The digital networking of the car can lead to more security and efficiency in road transport," SPD traffic politician Sören Bartol said.
However, the question of liability for accidents and the security of the driver's personal data must be clearly clarified.
However, the Germans still see self-driving cars skeptical - much more than French or American.
A survey of the Forsa Institute on Wednesday on behalf of the Dekra testing organization revealed that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous cars will be implemented in the next ten years, 32 percent only in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe in it at all.
In France, 21 per cent of the people surveyed by 2025 with autonomous cars, 33 per cent in the United States.
Nevertheless, the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely fully on a self-driving vehicle.
After a survey of the Bitkom Digital Association, only seven percent would agree to pass the control on all roads during the entire journey.
On the highway, this could still be estimated at 15 percent in the ongoing traffic, 45 percent in the stock.
For every fourth, the car would not leave control under any circumstances.
Boll says team start and double start at table tennis EM
The Düsseldorfer wants to strike only individually in the title struggles from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision shall be taken by 22 September at the latest.
"It's a huge loss for our team."
"The boys found out in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo," said Bundestrainer Jörg Roßkopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf.
Boll was on the flight to a long-term agreed sponsorship in China at that time.
The 34-year-old German master is expected back on Friday.
"Without Timo is the disadvantage, we are no longer such a clear favourite," said single European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the set list in Jekaterinburg, also reminded the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
"Then Timo also missed us, and we became European champions."
"We should be guided by this," said the World rankings list five.
The English football player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has drawn a serious injury to his right leg.
At the Champions League game at the PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit by a pickling of Héctor Moreno and replaced after long treatment.
The first diagnosis showed a rail fracture in the 20-year-old bastian pig rider.
Gaultier feels too old for a child terrible
It is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a growing figure Grusel cabinet: the designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition on his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The highlights: The window dolls, which thanks to video projections look amazingly human.
They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits - and so that he put men in dress.
"I can't say anymore that I'm the terrible kid of the skin couture because I have white hair."
"It was evident before, in the meantime it is true," said Gaultier.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk to The Catwalk", which is to be seen in the art hall of the Hypo-Cultural Foundation from 18 September, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initial negative attitude to a look about his person.
In fact, he had been against it, because: "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit after death," he said.
When you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris Station.
"It's so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the hardly yet to be seen work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an education.
Chronologically, the show is not built, but it is an excellent choreographed overall art work for which much effort has been made: For example, a stylist was employed to finish the dolls.
14 tonnes of material have been collected by the makers according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the October party, there was still a special charmer: a leather shirt outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("women are tougher than men") and for people who are a bit different," said Gaultier.
Gaultier's old Teddy is also shown at the exhibition.
He stands for the first, clever fashionable attempts of the designer.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad at football), he attracted his Teddy BHs and clothes, Gaultier said.
To play with a doll, his parents wouldn't let him.
The design of fashion he later joined himself.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
Later, I bought it, of course.
For his first fashion show he has not been able to pay the models.
They didn't get anything, but they could keep the clamots.
Jewelry instead of Garden - Plauener tipze as fashion-nish
It used to go into the long knitting machines and to make mud to make meters.
The stuffed fabrics and tips were produced in large quantities for customers who, for example, further processed them into blankets and gardens.
That alone doesn't work anymore today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, managing director of Modespitz Louen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauen peaks fashion played a bigger role, then was forced by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as niches.
Reinhardt cites some examples: tips in jewelry, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
At all events, the so-called vintage mode, which relies on past style pockets, is an increasing order potential.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they're already doing half of all the jobs.
Modespitze Louen is a member of the Plauener Spitze and Stickereries industry, together with nine other companies.
Only they may wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of sales have been lost.
Private trades and even wholesale are almost no longer available.
Our products barely reach customers this way.
The massware is today produced much cheaper in the Asian space and is distributed almost exclusively through chains.
In addition, exports are slowing down, currently in Russia and in the USA.
So enough reasons for new ways.
The industry association also tries to point out by environmental awareness how Cordula Bauer from the stake in Falkenstein explains: "We have been running a quality seal since this year, which shows that we are producing ecologically and socially sustainable".
Reinhardt adds: "This also applies to the materials used".
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger outdoors of the West Saxony University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Art - and specializes in embroidery and tips.
To counteract competition from the Asian space, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is an area of tension between the latest ideas of designers and the companies that must think particularly economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer strain.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter relived the historical snowball peak.
In some places, the machine sticks small balls.
The Plauen goldsmith Bianca Halebach-Krauße was inspired by this: "Before I could not start anything with traditional plauen peaks".
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an intensive procedure, it characterizes the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify themselves with the theme of the Plauen summit - young and old," Reuters says.
It also delivers to the USA, to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers who have lived in the pool and its surroundings and who want a piece of memory.
That's how I look at my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauen peak.
Disney's planting a new Mary Poppins movie.
Legend is not to be touched, but Disney is still waiting for a new movie by his classic Mary Poppins.
However, according to Entertainment Weekly, it's not about a new film, it's about a kind of continuation that's 20 years after the first movie with the magic baby girl.
It is about the experience of Nanny with the Banks family in the times of the world economic crisis in England.
Whoever plays Poppins for more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already standing: Rob Marshall, last time with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges the economy to open up more widely to the world
The economy needs to open up more widely to promote growth, said President Xi Jinping on Tuesday of a group commissioned with the direction of the reform.
"China should work towards attracting foreign investment and know-how and improving business-based strategies," he said in a statement at the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group for the Enhancing of a Comprehensive Reform.
The promotion of new foundations and the promotion of reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer a new place for economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of market access arrangements, the relaxation of border control policies, the promotion of state enterprises (SOEs), the inclusion of private capital, and the maintenance of the population reporting system.
After the statement, a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is tested from time to time and improved by test programs.
The initiative is important because it assigns a greater role to the market in the allocation of resources, ensures a legal state business environment and makes the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also relax controls on the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how they conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
Further areas of private investment are open to open up under an offer to open state-controlled sectors.
"The government will not change its foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them," the statement said.
In addition, it is made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimising the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to ensure the exercise of their activities and the use of professional judges and public prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also took part in the meeting, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double the mercury limit in raw fish
The European Commission wants to double the thresholds for mercury in large raw fish and thus give consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve toxicity.
The Foodwatch consumer organisation, which has a relevant EU working paper, strongly criticised the plans: "The risks and side effects of faulty industrial and environmental policies are being passed on to pregnant and young children," said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shark or swordfish for "economic policy reasons" are to be raised by one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
However, large predatory fish are already so heavily burdened with mercury that, on the basis of the existing limit values, about 50 per cent of the catches cannot be sold.
After double the limit values, then only 14.5 percent would be unsold.
In contrast to this closure, according to Foodwatch, the EU wants to increase the limits for other fish from 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch, however, referred to this as "Trick", because smaller Pacific fish, such as carp, are usually so low that they already comply with the planned maximum levels today.
The decrease in small fish is therefore "a perfect diversional handle that helps the economy alone", Wolfschmidt said.
Quecksilber is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans, which is highly enriched above the food chain, especially in raw fish.
Therefore, the Federal Government warns that "a small number of people are already in a position to cause particularly unborn damage to the nervous system".
The Federal Ministry of the Environment, however, declares on its homepage that there is no "health risk of the general population" to be expected.
Quecksilber is mainly achieved by coal burning into the environment.
According to a written statement by the Federal Ministry of the Environment, the German coal plants met with the Greens-Baerbock deputy Annalena Baerbock more than six tons of mercury per year, two thirds of the total quantity issued in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in Elbe, Rhein and Donau, was "permanently and superficially exceeded", the "speech" had quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, European-wide warnings against mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU alert system RASFF.
