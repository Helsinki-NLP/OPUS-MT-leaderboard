Inflation in Europe jumped for food
The acceleration of inflation in the euro area is due, in particular, to a steady increase in food prices.
The November price growth in the 13 euro area countries was higher than expected, with an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent recorded by 2.6 per cent in October, the Luxembourg Statistical Office of the Union announced.
The official forecast was only 3 per cent, issued by Bloomberg.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian emission banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not reduce the basic rate of interest by reducing together with rising prices of raw materials and reducing unemployment leads to inflationary spirals.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below two percent, but close to them.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in an absurd situation: inflation must be "redraited", so that it does not have to do anything later on.
In Germany, November inflation is 3.3 per cent of the 15-year-old record; then in Spain it rose from 3.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation in the euro area has melted away due to rapidly rising food and energy prices.
The time-limit for wheat prices has risen by 88 per cent, and the soybean price has also reached the highest since 1973.
Similarly, much more was needed in 2007 for edible oil and dairy products.
The oil price on the world markets this year rose by 52 percent, and last month it was already one barrel of black gold by nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will fall from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.5, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, 12-month inflation levels will remain at about 3-4 months, while its average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to reduce interest rates immediately twice during 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
The circle of supporters of the movement of Fides after the prolonged stagnation to the beginning of December has grown significantly and is now the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of the Gallup Institute socialists, the 13% support has never been measured.
In the case of certain party voters, the difference - due to the greater determination of opposition voters - was more than two-thirds (71 per cent) of support against the five support from the IMF.
MDF and SZDSZ are under a threshold for access to Parliament: their support for the entire population is two percent.
Among certain party voters are the beneficiaries of both camps by one percent more.
The public's view of the economy has also deteriorated in view of the previous minimum - it has never been the ratio of those who consider the economic situation of the country to be very bad, so high - 41 per cent, while according to another 46 per cent, the situation is quite bad.
Families will value the change of their material situation after spring and summer's most promising prospects now again more pessimistic.
As for next year, it counts most of the population with further deterioration and only tens with improvement.
In December, 71 per cent of the respondents were judged, which is most of all the Gallup Institute's research that the prime minister is doing his job more wrong than good.
Ferenci Gyurcsána believes or very believes 13 per cent of the respondents, while Victor Orbán shares 38 per cent of the beneficiaries.
The prime minister doesn't believe 54 per cent, the President of Fidess moves 27 per cent.
One of the indicators of political developments is how much of the public believes that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be resolved without a change in government.
While, after last October's troubles, the government and the prime minister saw a 35 per cent postponement, the rate is now only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) see the solution only in the issue of new elections.
In the interest of the referendum, it is noteworthy that 60 per cent of the respondents answered the question of their possible participation, that there would certainly be a referendum and that another 20 per cent reported that there would probably be a referendum.
For comparison, "Parliamental elections organised this week" would certainly be attended by only 55 per cent and another 15 per cent considered their participation to be likely; the success of the referendum would be beyond doubt on the basis of the present intentions.
The school would say no to 74, to medical fees 79, and to hospital stays 84 percent.
If we look at the same shares only in the circle of people who certainly promise to participate, then the introduction of a school, doctor's fees and hospital fees would be 81, 84, and 89 percent.
The most expensive is Auchan, nearly five times struck Tesco
The supermarkets in the Budaors commercial triangle maintained last year, on average 16 per cent of the price increase, with the difference that this year there was no increase in VAT.
Article of the Diary Napi Kašság
The usual Christmas consumables of the Napi Gagaság magazine in the Budaörs commercial triangle this year grew by an average of 16 per cent, but in all hypermarkets the price showed an increase of over a thousand forints.
Since the prices in the supermarkets of food "flighted" already fell in December, the percentage of the previous high base did not show up until such drastic intervention.
For consumers, however, it is certainly not a joy to know that what they can afford to buy peacefully at the price of under nine thousand forints will not be even in ten thousand now.
The consumption basket of the Daily Economy in tested hypermarkets exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003 the consumption basket was 6 800 forints.)
The price of Unica and living fish remained a trail on the last level, but the cruel breast, nuts, and mace were deeply affected.
The prices of bread and milk corresponded to data from the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we found a kilogram of bread even for 139 forints.
Competition did not come at the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was also surprising in this shop that the price of two litres of Coca Coly in the back bottle was below 200 forints, so the stock was only 257 forints.
Even so, this year, according to the consumer's journal Napi Masterság Auchan appeared as the most expensive, while Cora appeared as the cheapest.
According to our drafts, she raised the prices in the consumption basket of Napi Kaštágság due to the prices of Christmas Cora at 15, while Tesco and Auchan were about 18 per cent.
When comparing last year’s highest and this year’s lowest consumer basket values, the difference was 12 per cent, while the increase between last year’s lowest and this year’s highest is 21 per cent.
There was an increase in the forinths on average of 1,480.
The average increase in the price of wreaths rose to 1,206 forints with the price of wreaths being affected by the increase in VAT.
This is precisely what has turned the trade upside down, and the commercial houses have obviously not been able to decide how large price ranges should be set for individual products, as they have not been able to predict the impact of the change in prices on consumption.
(If the trader plans to run the product concerned incorrectly, a significant profit may be lost due to the price range of the adapted intensity of the turnover.)
Due to VAT, the rise in the price of the consumer basket of Napi Gachság appeared so extremely that the price of the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than in 2006, while the cheapest made the price difference of 844 forints all over the world.
This year the extreme difference did not appear, the most expensive basket now stood at 1,630 forints more than the Vloni and also the cheapest one at 1,284 forints.
In comparison with the two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase was found, with more than 20 months of daily consumption in supermarkets falling by more than 30 per cent.
(This does not fully confirm, among other things, the data of the Central Statistical Office: in the case of a few basic foods, an increase in prices exceeding 30 per cent over 12 months.
In addition to flour, for example, in the case of eggs.)
In the latter case, however, it appears impossible according to the Daily Economy consumer basket, since the price level of the product, quite expensive already last year, has shown, in the light of the base even in the worst case, price growth barely above 10 per cent.
Mower suppliers are more active in the market than egg suppliers, and they have also been able to place a drastic price increase in international chains.
The supermarkets in the gold triangle don't complain, they still refer to a good year.
According to our experience, most customers in the three visited shops are no longer interested in the price.
They buy everything in quantity, they take sustainable food on payroll.
On Wednesday morning all three supermarkets formed long fronts at the warehouse, as the number of visitors grew rapidly.
However, as we know, there is a lower trend in the countryside, more international chains are complaining to research firms that markets remain behind their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of durable consumer goods.
In many places it is stored in disinfectants
This year more than a thousand cases of infections have been reported in hospitals mainly due to inappropriate use of antibiotics.
The health conditions of hospitals, the overcrowding of beds, the overburdening of staff do not help to stop the disease, says the National Epidemiological Centre.
In many places they also save themselves from disinfectants.
Recently, MRSA infection was diagnosed in the traumatological department of St. John's Hospital.
Bacteria resistant to antibiotics were detected in a man who went to the hospital after a serious transport accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred in the same place at the beginning of the year.
A patient injured in a serious car accident was released at home, but soon thereafter he had to return with MRSA infection and a major surgery for the bacteria in his body had not yet been performed.
By 10 December this year, 1,094 infections were reported to the National System of Nesocomialis Surveillance caused by multi-resistance infections, reported Karolina Böröcz, prime minister of the National Epidemiological Centre.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant diseases have been safely registered in hospitals, and others are unknown.
Nearly two thirds (683) of the infections were caused by MRSA or methicillin-oxacilin with a resistant golden staphylococcal.
Bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (SA) carries a third of the people in the nose without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. cirrhosis, inflammation of the jaw, skin infection, wound infection) respond well to antibiotics and are treated well.
However, if antibiotics are administered excessively or inappropriately, they develop from a bacteria that reacts well to antibiotics that are very resistant to antibiotics and which spread rapidly under inadequate medical conditions.
In particular, in case of transient or persistent malfunction of the immune system in patients with impaired body, low body weight or in patients over the years, serious medical infections such as wound infection or blood poisoning - sepsis may occur.
According to the senior physician of St. John's Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, similar infections are part of everyday practice in hospitals.
"The infection must not be replaced with an epidemic, MRSA is not only there," said Tibor Nyulas, "where the presence of the origin of the disease is not investigated."
Overcoming Antibiotics
"We isolate these patients, the treating staff treat them in rubber gloves and in masks and for their treatment we need antibiotics," said Tibor Nyulas.
Patients admitted to the hospital are examined in advance for presence of MRSA, but infection cannot always be avoided.
Selection of sample is not in fashion
Most of the clinical infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but current conditions and conditions in domestic hospitals are not conducive to the prevention and spread of multi-resistant causes of disease, says Karolina Böröczová.
As this infection occurs symptomaticly in hospitals and nursing homes, the patients receiving it should be monitored and the MRSA carriers should be immediately isolated.
However, the selection of microbiological samples in Hungarian hospitals is not fashionable.
It also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not finance this investigation.
Most cases are so revealed if the patient suffers from detectable MRSA infection, the epidemiological centre principal said.
The European Union has strong recommendations for appropriate treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of individual infections, diseases.
Efforts should be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, or a microbiological examination should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but neither should the hospital in all cases comply.
The sampling of microbiological samples is even more rare in the primary, and ambulatory, treatment of patients, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Save in disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA is most frequently distributed among patients through healthcare personnel.
Therefore, it plays a very important role in washing hands and using gloves and masks, but there are also serious deficiencies in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by pancreatic infection and contact, but it is not always possible to isolate infected patients under domestic conditions.
On the contrary, the rooms are often crowded, the beds are often very close to themselves, although from an epidemiological point of view patients should be at least 1.5 metres away.
As Karolina Böröcz noted, unfortunately, we can also meet that in hospitals in an unfavourable material situation, they are saving on disinfectants, there are few nurses, and there are many patients, which is still increasing the chance of infection.
According to Karolina Böröczová, there is where the necessary protective measures are observed, similar infections are manifestly less or other spreads of the origin of the disease can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for health insurance and is therefore being fought everywhere.
For example, in England, the government has written down a prevention programme for MRSA, respectively, reducing its occurrence.
The program seems to be successful, according to published data, showing a declining trend of MRSA infection in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) sets out the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant origins of the disease (including MRSA), respectively of the hospital infections caused by these origins of the disease, among its priorities.
The police captain who caused a fatal accident was not drunk
The official intelligence assessment in the case of police captain XXII, which caused a fatal accident, is over.
It can be excluded that police captain XXII of the district, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday and who in the meantime resigned from his office, was driving under the influence of alcohol or misleading substances, would inform the Speaker of Attila Morvai's Chief State Representative on Friday after the knowledge assessment of this case was completed.
The knowledge assessment confirmed the result of the initial investigation, which had already found that the former police captain had not consumed any alcohol before sitting on the wheel.
The then director of the 21st District Police Directorate hit Lajose Kossutha on Tuesday in the 21st District of Lajose Kossutha in the 21st District by his own car when he turned away from a 50-year-old man who entered before him when crossing the vehicle outside the designated crossing.
(The latter fact that the walker has crossed the track, the rest according to road traffic rules, is not an affordable circumstance, the turning car must still give priority.)
After moving to the hospital, he died.
As a result of this incident, the district police director resigned and requested a shift to the post, according to the police report, because he was so shocked.
In this regard, the investigation of the Budapest State Investigation Office is carried out.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain had been working with state officials in the investigation from the outset.
Another 400 million euros for infrastructure
The agreement on the three credit frameworks of a total value of EUR 400 million in support of education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy were signed by the Minister of Finance of Budapest, János Veres and Marta Gajeck, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environmental projects under the Cohesion Fund under the amount of EUR 300 million, with the parties having previously concluded a loan agreement of EUR 100 million, which is now under way for the remaining EUR 200 million.
The credit agreement is also used to finance the budget of projects linked to education in the amount of EUR 150 million.
The EIB approved for Hungary a total of EUR 300 million for these purposes, with the extension of the credit agreement for the remaining EUR 150 million.
In the area of innovation, the parties signed a 50m-euro contract, which will be used primarily for the research and development project of the Debrecin University.
The meeting was also about the 4th subway route.
The parties agreed that after Hungary has agreed with the EU on the financing details of the metro, they will return to whether and how the original contract should be amended.
According to Jánose Verese, this may occur in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary of EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest on loans provided by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and without a mandatory fee is linked to the rate of EURIBOR.
Bulgaria is a real paradise for the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing - the attention of the whole of Europe is turning to a slightly neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who buy the cheapest, yet fast-paced EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Bulgaria with its cheap ski apartments and houses on the sea coast is now the most sought after Eastern European object of real estate purchases.
From the mountain are the most in the course of the area of Bansko, Borovic, Pamprovo and Vitoša, then on the sea coast Albena, Gold sands, Solar coasts, the ancient cities of Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for properties around Kavarna and Balčik.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the interest of investors and the central part of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will be aroused and more and more interested people will also buy in the surrounding exhibition of the cheap city of Russia.
The capital of Sofia is also a promise of flexible options, business and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on the best way to turn into one of the most attractive golf courses in Europe, and thus to be alongside the summer and winter season with the sought-after goal of the journey even in the next two years.
Predictive investors are already buying in a large way, for example in the area of Banska.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are also trying to change their lifestyle and lifestyle.
Most customers come from England, but also customers from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
There are also Maltese and Cypriot investors here, at the Black Sea and in the ski gardens there are traditionally many Russian customers.
The foreign buyer can be divided into three groups, says Georgia Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Instituting people buy either renovated properties worth 50 to 100 thousand euros, or abandoned old houses for 5 to 15 thousand euros, which then renovate.
They require good access and communication opportunities, which are important for them close to the big city, shops and local doctor’s routine.
The second category is the buyers of the chat (Bulgaria ranks among the first 10 German recreational goals in December).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in the hope of a rise in value in the medium- or long-term horizon.
The city’s real estate supply is uninterrupted, for the demand is even stronger.
Bulgaria, however, has the lowest prices of reality in the European Union, but in the last five years it has grown by 21 per cent annually.
The increase in real estate prices greatly exceeds the increase in wages.
Fódor and six percent Hungarian
According to information provided by the Minister of Environment and Water Management of Gábor Fodor, the meeting of experts will be concluded on Tuesday and the international conference on the climate regime will continue to be held by ministers after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are talking about the Travel Map from Bali, which addresses efforts following the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
They are currently being debated in a stormy manner between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also announced that they do not want to deal with exact numbers now, although they agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 per cent by 2020, given the state of the world in 1990.
The next major issue of the conference is whether the developed countries will join in addition to reducing emissions as well as providing both material and technological assistance to countries that have been rejected.
The Agreement was also born on grants for developing countries.
The grant fund, established by the Kyoto Protocol, will be run by the 16-member board of directors, probably within the framework of the Global Environment Programme (GEF) at the UN - we can read in the magazine Piac és Profit.
Six percent Hungarian
The Minister for Environment and Water Management, Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leading role in the effort to achieve global climate protection and support the establishment of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent against 1990 levels by 2020, regardless of the success of the adoption of the "after-2012 agreement", and is prepared to commit to a 30% reduction if the other mature regions of the world are also willing to accept responsibilities and commitments in accordance with their potential.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 had reached a target of 5.2 per cent reduction, while the 15 EU Member States committed 8 per cent.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent against 1985-87, which our authorities will fulfil. - The press report of the Ministry of the Environment recalls.
In Bali it is a matter of many years since it is necessary to adopt an international agreement on long-term climate change policy, otherwise its entry into force with certainty would have moved up to 2012. In this case, on the reduction commitments set out in the Kyoto Protocol, the new emission reduction system would not be immediately renewed, and the need for the latest report would also be indicated by the United Nations International Scientific Assembly dealing with climate change - IPCC, which is the bearer of the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would delay the reduction of emissions and inevitably increase the average temperature on Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which, according to scientists, should be extremely serious and irreversible.
British Army Launches Set on YouTube
British military units publish on the server to share video recordings from events in Iraq and Afghanistan, which they themselves promote.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) favorite YouTube: special units operating here in Afghanistan have been recording videos from the actions against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC announced.
Recordings, set up by a miniature camera attached to the trailer, are controlled by the Air Force Command in the Kandahar field and then sent further to London, where they are transferred to the Internet.
Political Message Is Unavoidable
This form has already received 139 recordings of British air force soldiers on the Internet and their "channel" has already been viewed by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered in spring 2007 as "defenceheadquarters" and publishes recordings of events in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Common World Office) and international peace units in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channels on YouTube.
Setting up in Afghanistan
Air forces have published videos according to their original purpose for the purpose of the recruitment and according to the Ministry of Defence are also good to inform the general public of the actual purpose of the presence of an army abroad.
"Propaganda published in this form against traditional television advertising is almost nothing," BBC expert Gordon Mackenzie said on defence issues, "but it is also necessary to carry a certain political message, because the special form confirms the legitimacy of the military actions decided by the government."
Americans have made the game
The army is concerned that in addition to carefully adjusted, censored recordings, amateur videos are also available on the server, including the death of soldiers: in some covert, "official" promotional films, the officials are talking about losses, but the bloody form of the fight is not being presented.
There have been many videos already on the Internet from the fighting camps in Iraq and Afghanistan, which occurred during the hard siege, but the British army has been on them so far.
Americans perform a set a little different - using a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to download and in which a player can get directly into the skin of soldiers through most faithful simulations.
There will be Christmas in the ministries with a symbol and a pie
The Ministry of Labour Monika Lamperth is not likely to be sentimental: the Christmas party venue will hold a final working meeting for its employees, which will be held in 2007 with Pagans and Coffee.
In some ministries, there will be a celebration with live music, and elsewhere will be a celebration of the Christmas atmosphere with a symbol and a toast.
Dinner, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and Swedish table - so enjoy the powerful.
State authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
The most expensive Christmas celebration is organised by the Ministry of Defence this year, but it does not expect its employees.
On Christmas, orphans will receive gifts from children of fallen soldiers, family members of soldiers serving in foreign missions at Mission holidays, but they also arrange receptions for journalists.
The resort is devoted to the atmosphere at the end of the year 25 million.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economics and Transport (GKM) will throw themselves out of the pit against other resorts.
The GKM dinner is held in the centre of Jöv-Háza, a total of 4,320,000 forints and about three hundred and fifty guests are expected from six hundred ministerial employees.
The resort at its celebration will hold Christmas traditions, but it will also come to various performances and will also hit the ball.
The NFÜ Christmas stood 4,700,000 forints and took place on Wednesday in the State Judicial Council (OIT) building - the program included concerts and dinners.
The rent of the hall stood a million forints, the remainder was charged to more than four hundred invited.
It seems that one department of NFÜ is invited to another Christmas celebration: this is where a company is organised to ensure the course of tenders, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) from the Union's money.
To that end, they rented the Vígsínhaz Theatre.
MAG a. s. did not confirm this information because we failed to reach the person concerned.
Clothing is not necessary
The ILO building not only hosted NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and Security, which held the 7th December St. Lucie's dance instead.
From him, however, OIT did not want the money for using its halls.
Five hundred people took part in the dance.
The dinner started by the health minister, and after dinner it was possible to dance for live music.
According to the answer to the portal question [origo] on the dance were not necessarily evening clothes or clothes.
The Puritan party is scheduled for health, work and local self-government resorts.
The Ministry of Health organizes a programme and celebration for employees for 400,000 forints in their own building.
The ministry of work Monika Lamperth's collaborators are not even officially calling for a Christmas party, but for a final work meeting.
One hundred and eighty guests are counted who, according to the press department, will only get coffee and cookies, so only 350,000 forints will be available for parties.
The Minister of Local Authorities Gordon Bajnai will simply join his collaborators in the Chamber of Local Authorities and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organises a Christmas meeting, which awaits 436 employees, in its own big room.
On Christmas party it spends 2,500 forints on guests - the total amount includes receptions with Swedish tables and snacks.
Since being Minister János Veres, PM Christmas workers have been celebrating in a similar way every year.
However, the atmosphere of the party will be missing, the officiality will strengthen not only ministerial speech, but also afternoon time.
The agricultural resort organises a new year's reception on January 20th, and the ministry's Christmas is unknown.
The reception will take place in the castle of Vajdahunyadvár in the City Gardens and, according to the Ministry, there are 1,000 forints per person for a hundred guests.
According to the press department, it will be a very simple reception, to which only relevant foreign diplomats are invited in Hungary.
These annual receptions begin with a brief visit by the Minister of Health.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not arrange Christmas parties at all, the [origo] portal informed the relevant printing department.
The price of Christmas celebrations of the environment resort in the press department was not able to communicate.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to a party at the Museum of Art.
He's leaning to a huge stand.
The Association of Trade Unions of the League, and the All-State Trade Councils (MOSZ) respectively, shall establish their staffing committee on Friday to coordinate the monthly unrestricted posts.
On Saturday, a protest public meeting will be held, Monday - on the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act - will be held.
The event certainly causes a serious stopover of transport, because it will almost completely stop rail transport and within 13 hours the staff of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also be hired.
On Friday afternoon, the League will meet with the Full State Association of Trade Councils with details jointly organised Monday.
The LIGA-MOSZ Staff Committee will also be set up, which will coordinate Monday's action.
On Saturday, a protest public meeting takes place, and from Monday, the board joining the post will stop work indefinitely unless there is agreement with the government.
This means that there was no time limit for the termination of the post beginning on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If Parliament does not finally adopt the Health Insurance Act, the Boards of Appeal will withdraw immediately.
However, if the legislation is passed, the staffing committee shall meet and decide on a further procedure.
According to the Monday agenda of Parliament's meeting, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will be voted on until late evenings, if necessary at night.
As a result of the start-up on Monday, it is possible to calculate the serious interruptions in transport: the work will be stopped on the railway for an indefinite period, the part of the Budapest bulk transport can be stopped in the morning and more than half of the company Volán.
At the same time, there are many places in the country where half of the road is closed.
A number of committees and civil society organisations have joined the call for office, the list of which is constantly updated on Liga’s website.
Some organizations have been reporting the unemployment rate indefinitely, while others have reported temporary job interruptions.
Until Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Road (MÁV) and the Independent Committee of Railway Workers (VDSZZZZZ) were unable to agree on sufficient services, while at the beginning of Christmas holidays, more people travel by rail.
According to previous reports, from the start of operation to 13 hours at BKV, from 7 to 9 a.m. at Budapest Airport, the four-hour position will be organised by the LIGA Energy Industrial Staff Association, to a 2-, 2-8-hour stop, respectively, by the Teachers' Committee and the Teachers' Democratic Committee.
The association of Hungarian doctors will be suspended throughout the country, the Democratic Committee of Health and Social Affairs (EDDSZ), which is part of the Cooperation Forum of Trade Unions (SZEF), organises a two-hour watch post.
The most important of the four requirements formulated by the League is that the government withdraw the proposal for health insurance reform and submit a new concept for public discussion.
The second requirement is that a new way of calculating pensions be introduced gradually from next year.
Third, in order to ensure the possibility of inclusion in the system already before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Committee of Railway Workers (VDSZZZZ), which is a member of the League of Directors, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport concerning railway lines, and expects another offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard has increased the risk of the country
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded with the support of the movement Jobbik Magyarországért in August of this year, according to the Risk Analysis Division of the Institute of Political Capital has immediately increased in several areas of political risk in Hungary and the whole area.
The "risk warning" prepared by the company says: in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, it is the greatest political risk that "the sharpness of the existing ethnic tension between the Roma and the non-Romanian population of Hungary may, in a short time, also lead to violent ethnic clashes".
The main reason is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is likely to be geared towards challenging such an action - the research institute provides.
As it says, all this can be explained by one of the biggest concerns of Hungarian political representatives: "The public debate on the Roma issue has been abandoned by representatives of public life to representatives of radical and extremist political groups who could put up a political strategy against the Roma-Hungarian opposition."
This deepens the problem, weakens normal dialogue, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts - the Institute of Justice.
In addition, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, according to the research institute, have had a significant impact on domestic and foreign media "to a large extent has shown Hungary's image abroad, especially with regard to belief in the stability of the country and its democratic growth".
The Institute recalls: part of the reorganisation of Hungarian radical and ultra-legislative groups, which has been gaining ever greater publicity and awareness since autumn 2006, is that since 2007, several organisations have been created in Hungary, which themselves are called "national home defences".
"The common image of these groups is that they define themselves as civil society, while openly reporting - and armed - the readiness of their members to carry out defence tasks (in the case of animal disasters, attacks by the authorities, disruption of order), in addition, with an indication of the inability of the police, the army, or the state," he adds.
It also notes that this is all happening in a way that seeks to package the most diverse political efforts made to resist the political and civil movement of society.
The emphasis on civilisation and the form of society in the case of these associations is therefore not only to avoid legal proceedings for judicial registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-increasing factor in neighboring relations.
"In recent months, they have pointed to the Hungarian Guard immediately in several neighbouring states as a potential source of danger, and ultranationalist political representatives of some neighbouring countries have called for the emergence of the Hungarian Guard to apologize for their own anti-Madiya policy.
All of this can have an impact on the political stability of the area," he adds.
According to the research institute, the creation of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not a single phenomenon, so the political risk for areas as a whole has increased.
According to the report, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are similar, for example, to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation was announced by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
In the background of the Bulgarian Guard there are mass Roman riots that broke out in one of the Sofia districts (Krasna Poljana).
The UN used this to set up a guard with the organization's goal of "national home defence".
In the past 17 years, according to it, "cican terror" has appeared in Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and loathsome, the Institute of Political Capital recalls.
It adds that the initiative sparked a heated debate by the Bulgarian public.
As it goes on to say, the increase in the risk of ethnic clashes signals the announcement by some Bulgarian Roma organisations that they create their own guard on the sign of resistance.
Since the current activities of the Hungarian Guard show similarities with the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that even the Hungarian Roma respond to the threat in a similar way, by establishing their own home defence, we can take note of the risks posed by the Political Capital Institute.
Attila Juhász, research director of Political Capital Institute, pointed to the issue by the press office: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, risk analysis is published every year and if it finds out something that could affect the change of risk, they shall inform the public opinion, as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Celebrations are not everywhere free
In Hungary, the days of the holiday are set precisely by the law and it has become common practice to move around the holidays, which will be less than once in the coming year.
In the European Union and in America, holidays are not the same.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and state holidays and working days.
Workdays of peace are most important to church holidays or important historical events.
We also celebrate New Year: the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year is a job-free - for New Year so that people can rest after Silvestra.
We have a total of eleven free holidays during the year.
The national festival is March 15th celebrating the 1848 and October 23rd revolution, a memorable day of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20, we celebrate the founding of the state, on May 1, November 1 and 2 we remember our dead relatives and friends.
Besides, we have two-day holidays of Easter, Lent and Christmas.
Since our national, national or religious holidays, according to the calendar, rarely seem to be a weekend, it has become a practice to move the working day if we work only one day before or after the holiday.
The price for extended weekends, however, is that we stay in the workplace and in school last Saturday.
The fact that the day that the holiday is immediately preceded or followed, we have worked out, for many years now, the Minister of Labour has been making a special statement.
The legislation shall apply equally to all employees and their employees, to public employees and to persons in public service.
However, it does not apply to companies and institutions which are operating without interruption or having regard to their intended purpose even on working days.
This year the work order will change only around the holidays at the end of the year: as of December 24, life in the country will gradually be stopped, because according to experience, most people between Christmas and Silvester will "work" or use a saved holiday.
The next year will be the middle of several of our holidays, respectively, at the end of the week, so the shifts of the working day will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar will be changed around the holiday of work so that the workers can stay at home for four days of taste.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day so it can be the opposite on Friday, May 2nd, on the day of rest.
The next move relates to the festival on 23 October: Saturday 18 October will work instead of Friday 24.
However, at the end of the year next year will be able to take place entirely on the anniversary of the holidays, because from December 24 they will have almost everywhere a nonstop holiday, even though Silvester seems on Wednesday.
Six Scaring Little Things You Can Angry Your Friends
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never get, innocent lies that we don't even notice: they all "feel" every day at work.
The question is whether you will get used to these little inconveniences, or put on gloves and unclear situations that others may be angry with, you will deliberately avoid.
Guys.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you they were looking for you from the marketing department," your colleague will tell you.
That's why you missed the mine?
In a better case, he regrets and tries to correct it, may call the marketing department and says he forgot to pass the message (this is a less common solution).
The most common thing is solved once and for all.
Before you apologize, it is good to think about what you can do to prepare your colleagues for unpleasant moments, and try to avoid it, of course.
Do you borrow something that's not yours?
There's nothing more unpleasant than hanging up for some writing, office needs or your phone, and they're not there.
Do you remember you put yourself on the table last night, but it's gone by morning?
Or have you discovered your feathers on the table of one of your colleagues, which you considered to be lost?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without permission, or they'll be right angry that you're messing with them.
Do not refer to the envelope or sticky paper office because it may be unpleasant when you arrive early, and you will need it immediately.
A little bit about the private life of colleagues?
There is no good solution to stop the spreading of the bells.
Who, who was he doing with?
Where and why?
Woe to every man for the news of the private life of his companions!
If any of them share their innermost secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Lock up what you have heard, and in his absence do not try it with your colleagues, even if others know about it.
You're not reporting your absence for no reason?
If you call to the office and recall your absence with strong headaches, because it is not good for you, or you say that you would rather rest today, think that your work, urgent tasks and work that have a certain deadline will have to be done for you by someone else.
Take care of your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the second day you will not go to work or that something can happen that you will have to stay at home, announce that your colleagues and leaders will not be confronted with your absence until the second day.
Consumption, moving, calling
Did you sink into a job that will take you out of the pit by moving your colleagues?
You didn't want to be a witness to a phone conversation that would be better off if you didn't even hear it?
Do not disturb your employees by consumption, singing, talking loud (above their heads), or assging, standing stone, loud dissatisfaction.
All of this can be disturbing even if they are not banned from any project (writing, planning, organization).
You're accusing the other guys of making mistakes?
If there is no time or if you have forgotten to send an important letter or message, do not blame for your other forgetfulness!
Don't get in touch with any chaos in the office and noisy colleagues!
Admit it if you missed it and someone paid for it, and fix the damage!
Ask yourself how you could put things in order, fix the nuisance!
Do you feel in the office too much at home?
Warms and shoes: comfortable clothes at home, but not suitable for the office!
Don't take clothes for free, even if it allows your profession!
Don't be careless, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in your usual dress - and if your profession requires it, nice and elegant!
When a person wants to succeed, he ceases to be interesting
Getting together in the usual early hours.
A special melody is heard from the radio: the sound of the drums to which electronic effects are connected.
Adding the volume.
Music changes the pace and the previous tone is added to the bass, then the female congregation joins as a real gem.
At mr2 station, the composition of the Zagar group is called Wings of Love.
For a long time, our home musical life did not destroy us with a high - quality electronic pop.
Suddenly, though, the tape looks quite different, because you're just listening to the new Zagara album.
The discovery of Yonderboy, a few new and interesting productions from the home digital underground, the overall picture is slowly changing, and although it is once again in the fashion of the garage rock with its cracking into the guitar, even the home electropop proves that it is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in the Pentecostal and he also played in the Yonderboy's chapel, until finally - perhaps because two assholes don't go to one castle - he gave his own way.
With his project (Zagar) and music that combines the elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pops, however, he began to fail until he was called upon to compose soundtracks (e.g.
Ference Töröka film "Szezon").
His formation, which started in smaller clubs, became known to a wider audience after the magazine wan2 placed their first album from 2002 among the 50 most important home boards and announced Zagar in Yonderboie as the only domestic development that could also be sold in the West.
Zagar and his hats are undoubtedly "in the course", although of course no one has asked if they are satisfied with this label.
The band reacted as it belonged: it made a new, better album.
Now a released album called Cannot Walk Fly Instead can open new paths, although the name itself is trying to create a link with the initial flights in Petikostel.
This is one verse from the composition of the darker old band Balázse Zságer.
The reference to essential, flying would be in place, but beside the essential breath of this music has now appeared - according to the spirit, the trend of time - louder guitar, the influence of rock and role.
In these songs the singer György Ligeti, currently working in England with The Puzzle group, was presented at the premiere of the album in the Millenáris Park.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to the station mr2 Pet.fi, which has been playing the last time from morning to evening popular music, we began to sing various tunes by Wings of Love, recorded with six domestic singers ("underground Divas").
So everything's all right (?).
The portal hvg.hu told Balázzzáger.
hvg.hu: In relation to this new hit the question is offered, how much is left of what you are playing, edge music?
Balázs Zságer: Definition of district music doesn't mean much to me.
I think there are two different castes of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, they don't say anything, and that's how it can only arise because of sales, which makes it commercial.
However, even a good pop composition can originate from an honest internal need.
This spirit also operates in the way it is received, regardless of language and state borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audience towards your music?
B. Zs.: In a foreign country, especially from us to the west, music has a lighter tradition.
There's not only teenagers and people going to concerts for 20s, but also older ones.
Much more is seen in the changes in light music that are taking place around them, because they also consider it part of a contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care who listens to your music, where and how much?
B. Zs.: Of course it's a good feeling that our concerts go as far as possible.
But we never did music for the market.
We don't have music for a purpose, but for what reason?
The role of the public is perceived rather at concerts where mutual influence is already in place, but it is hidden only in inexhaustible changes of the moment.
I noticed, though, that if a person wants to please the audience, he's stopped being interesting ever since.
hvg.hu: How much are you going to follow the example of Yonderboie?
He works alone and builds his career more west of us.
B. Zs.: We are not actually going his way, regardless of how our music sometimes tries to explain itself.
Rather, we are team players who rely on the musical presence of the other and let it develop.
At first, of course, our work was not to be avoided by comparing it with Yonderboie’s compositions, for several of us separated from his band and set out on a different path.
hvg.hu: In the toplist station mr2 Petâfi the composition of Wings of Love was obtained in the first place.
Many heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this composition.
Have you made the most popular style of opening yourself up to wider layers?
B.Zs.: We shouldn't have planned to write a hit to sell the board.
There's more to that song.
We thought of it as the final album that we tried to relax with the previous sound orgy and more complicated topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose those six singers?
Why is it - what was the main principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a gospel congregation.
Then came the idea to compose this assembly of the soloists of the home music scene with a good voice.
So this six-member congregation - that is, Sena, Edin Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Peterfy, Enik-Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - was brought together, which we then crossed on the Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: That's exactly how you meant the song, or did girls make something up about it?
B.Zs.: The building has long existed in the instrumental version, when the material went to the disk, we said that there would be something else to do with this composition.
Following the accords, he argued that a singer should join him.
That night, I sang to him a song that the girls later learned.
The whole thing came out almost the first time and terribly spontaneous.
I remember how it came back, but of course, Diva needed it.
With my voice, it wouldn't work so energetically.
hvg.hu: As on the table, the concert seemed to be girls in the background.
They don't have solos (except Judy Jay), they don't have their own role, they sing all together and they're not louder than music, so music just doesn't accompany their songs.
They also stood in the back of the stage.
Is that intentional?
B.Zs.: The fact that they stood behind was only because of technical problems.
The fact that we didn't want to share the solo role is the contrary.
Even this song is about us forgetting our ego a little bit, where is it from, where is it, and let only those wings raise wings of love.
I wish this euphoric state, which we felt when that song was born, was felt by others.
hvg.hu: What was the most work with?
B.Zs.: During the composition of music, not even with one, the harder pieces appeared when mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play on the concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time he didn't want to work grooves, then all the nice things slowly found his place like in some warehouse.
hvg.hu: What composition from the new board is your favorite?
B.Zs.: That's still changing through the concert, and I've already released the album.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The betrayer risked billions of minorities
Loserful debaucher.
This is how his brother-in-law Jerome Kerviela, French bank giant Société General, the owner of the foreign commercial bank.
Because he's got five billion euros worth of money.
But it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to make up for his colleagues, and he certainly wasn't.
Unlike all large banking houses, the crisis on the American mortgage market has been spreading.
"He's mentally weaker," said out of the mouth of his superiors, who sent him to the police.
But as it comes from Kerviell's statement by the French media, such as Le Monde's journal, it was the person who at the end of last year had profit from his trades of 1.6 billion euros.
Crisis not just in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he said in a statement.
In the summer, he managed to make half a billion euros in the US crisis.
The opportunity was felt by the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to reveal that so-called sub-prime mortgages provided to low-income customers or those who in the past had problems with payment will have problems.
The whole economy had no impact on this crisis.
Kerviel didn't believe it and put it right.
At the end of the year, his profits amounted to up to 1.6 billion euros.
"By the time I made the first half billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel admits, adding that he certainly left nothing for himself.
Throughout the interview, he admits that he faked records so that they wouldn't come to him.
He even managed to cheer the boss up, even though he began to be interested in his business by the Eurex Stock Exchange.
Risk was profit
He's afraid he'll find out?
Not anymore.
"I thought it was just a simple fact that I made 1.6 billion for the bank that would satisfy them."
Where did he take so much risk?
He had to work gradually in his position.
He joined the Société Generale in 2000 shortly after he graduated from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later he was an assistant broker and in 2005 he became a single broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew he would never make as much as the rest.
"In my first interview in 2005, I knew they were paying for me.
Because of my education and also because of professional and personal development," Kerviel described to investigators.
But soon after the show, the first great success came.
Thanks to Allianz's action, he won a half-billion euros in the bombing of London.
And it was a trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you earn, we'll leave you.
"It's like a snowball," he told the cops.
But the bosses knew all about it, or they knew it.
"As long as I made the money, my eyes were closed."
But then the morning came at the beginning of this year.
In one day, he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to freeze.
When he came to work on Monday, he didn't work at the bank anymore.
And the bank reported a few days later that he had five billion euros.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
"I've only chosen four days in the past year.
A broker who doesn't have a permit is a broker who doesn't want anyone to look into his records," Kerviel said.
Czech Republic has a chance to get 365 billion
The Czech Government ministers yesterday, with representatives of the European Commission, signed a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can obtain EUR 14 billion in the coming years (approximately SEK 365 billion).
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in 2007 to 2013.
Approximately 125 billion crowns will come from seven operational programmes to regions.
Czech companies will be able to get around 100 billion crowns from the Business and Innovation programme.
The most money, up to 150 billion, will be directed towards transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and accounts for up to 22 per cent of the funds the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will raise the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will be managed by 90.8 billion crowns next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to obtain funds for innovative enterprises.
Companies should receive funding for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organisational methods.
In the past, the EU funds have been spent by the Czech Republic in the framework of the newly adopted countries, among the least successful.
The 20-year penalty for the Nicaraguan president was confirmed by the court
On Thursday, the Nicaraguan Court of Appeal confirmed the 20-year penalty for the former President of the country, Arnold Alemán, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud amounting to $100 million (up to $1.8 billion).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived in a home prison on his ferry near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
If a former head of this Central American state from 1997 to 2002 returns to the grid, the AP agency does not consider it clear at this time.
According to the President of the Appeals Court, Ileana Pérez will now be concerned about the prison perpetrators whether they let Germany serve his sentence at home or whether he is in prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Germany that he regularly transferred government money to foreign business accounts in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the account actually belonged to his relatives and closest steppes.
Some of these money then ended up in the fund that Germany founded on financing its election campaign in 2001.
So they approved our budget.
That's right.
The State budget was adopted.
Why is this budget exceptional?
It is the first budget made up of this government and the accepted coalition majority without support for the opposition.
This year, he spent more time with the support of the ČSSD, because he was prepared by the Minister of Saturday and the ČSSD could not afford to accept him.
Unlike the heated debate before the vote on the government's distrust, nothing dramatic has been done this time.
This traditionally overlooked, although most influential, photo gallery passed the law in peace.
It's a paradox.
Each government begins and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether someone likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of the policy, but it is hidden from the government's powerful opposition to the opposition.
This is more media-thankful, and that's why he's paying a lot more attention in the media.
Politics is much more interesting to the public than bad numbers.
State budgets in the past social democratic governments have suffered three disasters which for 2008 are unable to resolve all of a sudden:
The first of these is a high proportion of the law on compulsory, so-called mandateary expenditure, which is not only pensions, but also social benefits that were approved by the silent "coals" of ČSSD and KSCM last year before the elections.
The second is the deficit economy as a result of the first failure.
The third limit is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of the city and municipality budgets.
However, the greatest risk is not the deficit in the state budget.
He's public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of cities and towns.
In addition to the tax, fees and loans from banks, many caretakers have been able to obtain additional investment resources, often without having to issue bonds that have been unduly owed to their advisors.
In recent years, they have managed to pay these debts for the mass sale of energy and other diluents that they have received from the state of privatisation.
They don't have this resource anymore.
If we just stick to official and verifiable facts, we will find that:
Our economy has been going on for several years, as well as the rest of the world, a growth phase, which is constantly glorifying the ČSSD.
It was a unique opportunity for her governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, however, the state became more and more indebted.
Other countries, except for a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more wisely than our republic.
It's a huge shame that falls primarily on the governments of the past.
We are among the countries that are at least at least at risk of poverty on a global scale.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes that have, unfortunately, been completely overhauled in recent years.
Even if part of the foolish populist expenditure approved this year before the elections has been cancelled, so that in the near future there will not be a move to retirement and pension reform, then in fact any policy in this country will end, and no one will rule in such a way.
With little effort, it can be said that government policies will become officials, mechanically dividing most of the money taxed on pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only stop the execution of normal expenditure by mandate officers.
The planned deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely unnecessary if the previous governments did not manage over the past ten years.
If we do not really want the government's policies to become only officials, then we need to be patient and encourage this less powerful coalition government, which realizes that the state can only issue as much as it can get on taxes and charges, peace to prepare other reform laws.
Only those will allow for the gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The United States Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the Central Banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada decided to fight together against the crisis in financial markets.
In the monetary market, more than a hundred billion dollars will be obtained through auctions.
In these auction banks, they prefer the interest rate that they are willing to borrow money for.
For example, the U.S. Federation will send $40 billion to the auction, another $40 billion to the European and Swiss central banks.
It is the first time since the 11th September attacks that the central banks of each State have agreed on this coordinated approach to preventing or reducing the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step is intended to address the biggest economic difficulties, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that banks could borrow," Bernard Baumohl of Economic Outlook Group, in his report, told customers.
"The coordinated action of central banks reduced the likelihood of recession in the United States from 65 per cent to 50 per cent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion for unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect another billion losses.
"Central banks must be really afraid of what else they can follow when deciding on this process," said ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are afraid that if banks have difficult access to loans themselves, they would rather lend to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the US economy to recession with potential impacts on the economic growth of the world.
The central banks thus decided after not being able to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used for lending money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still concerned about borrowing money from each other, even though the central banks of the United States, Canada and Britain have reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another decrease in interest rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio from Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the central banks step will contribute to the recovery of the crisis, because it does not solve the basic problem, which is the fall of the real estate market in the United States.
Klaus: The debate of environmentalists is incredible
Global climate change is expected to damage the developing countries most.
President Václav Klaus again spoke on the issue of global warming.
Criticism has now taken place at the final UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not a green planet, he stated that the debate of ecologists is incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of a conference that creates a strange mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that drives it, and the reality.
"The debate is completely unstructured there, it is just a flame of words that is a substitute for solving current problems," Klaus said.
In presenting his book, the Czech President stressed that her theme was very important to him, and that is why she is so committed to them.
He also expressed his satisfaction that the book appeared in a German translation, because, as he said, "I often meet only the cartoons of my opinions".
Now, then, the interested ones can read his unrecorded attitude.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climate scientist, but he believes he has enough assumptions to write such a book.
He is therefore an academic, able to monitor and assess professional relations, has experience with statistics and is also a national economy.
For the main conclusions, the book also noted that climate is constantly changing and its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consistent opinion of all scientists that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and therefore pose a threat and that efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, inefficient and unacceptable.
Moreover, as a person with experience with totality, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels is dangerous to restrict freedom.
He repeatedly explained that it is not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits".
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at Hayek Institute.
The driver couldn't change 600 thousand people
Six hundred thousand drivers have missed the deadline and have not been able to exchange an old driving licence whose validity will expire at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can ask for an exchange to be made by the authorities to issue a new certificate by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after New Year's, drivers will be released on the highway without a valid authorization.
According to the authorities, the certificate was not exchanged mainly for those who did not want to run anymore.
While the municipality is reporting a rapid decline in driver exchange, the metro stations are being flooded with requests and the interest in certificate exchange has grown this week.
The Magistrate takes about 2,000 customers a day.
There's about half an hour waiting in front.
In Prague, the driver's license has not changed for about 140,000 drivers yet.
The issue of a new certificate takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to request the issue within a short period of five days.
In such a case, the driver will pay five hundred crowns.
Motorists who do not reach the end of the year and go on the road without a valid driver will be threatened with torture from January.
The offender will pay up to two thousand crowns.
But a police officer can handle the crime with an agreement.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine shall be paid at 2500 kroner.
According to earlier information, he could have been punished by a counselor and a man who would not go anywhere.
He was supposed to pay 30,000 crowns.
The ministry had previously called on the authorities to be mild and to store the highest thousandth of a fine.
According to the spokesperson for transport, Karl Hanzelka, but the tens of thousands of sufferings are not threatening anyone.
The driving licence is based on a document that people can decide whether they want it or not.
It's not a civil certificate that every person must have valid.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give up the driver's license.
It shall be sufficient for it to be sent or sent by post to the competent general authority.
At the end of the year, the certificates issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid.
However, motorists must gradually exchange other types of driving licenses.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to exchange.
The certificates issued between 2001 and 2004 shall expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million other documents.
The court reduced the penalties for detectives with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Konjárík, who are charged with criminal involvement with David Berdych's gang, will go to 13 years in prison.
With definitive validity, the Prague Supreme Court decided to reduce the penalties by one year and two years.
Initially, it threatened the detectives of the Prague Crimes Committee for 14 and 12 years.
The present decision cannot be appealed any longer, only the appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdich is also accused in this case, but he is only waiting for the first instance verdict.
However, in other proceedings, he has already been punished for a total of 16 years.
He can't get any more.
In January, the Supreme Court acknowledged in particular that 19 people were guilty of delinquency, and today the Supreme Court has decided to revoke 16 of them.
Most of the defendants have refused to accept the case under investigation since the beginning of the investigation.
According to the Central Senate, after agreement with Berdych, police officers transmitted information to criminals from police sources, covered individual burglary and helped gang members avoid criminal liability.
Gang gave up 30 percent for Opawa and Konjárík.
The complaint concerns the criminal activity of the gang from 1999 to 2001.
Especially about thieves whose victims have often suffered serious health damage, but also abuse of the authority of the public agent and illegal arms.
During home visits, the police discovered illegally held guns, shot with steel core, laser meter or self-fire.
Gang's been charged with robbery for tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to the silent testimony of the twenty men in this trial, the courts have already duly recognized the perpetrators of other Berdych thieves and a number of other people.
Other men around Berdych still speak before the court in another trial, some cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The main calculation has so far been avoided by Tomáši Potov and Maroši Šulej, who live in an Irish prison where they are awaiting a final decision on their issue to the Czech Republic.
Account for child replacement: 12 million
In exchange for children in childbirth, the lawyer of the injured Igor Veleb family wants to pay 12 million crowns, plus court expenses.
For every mother of three million, for the father of two million, and for the children of a million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The legal representative of Ondřej Hospital was therefore not in agreement with Veleby's proposal.
"We reject such a request, it is very high," said Gotal after today's debate.
"But in order to be able to give an opinion on the counter proposal, we need a knowledgeable judgment that the counter-party has been able to draw up.
We'll find out if he's got any value.
But we hold on to the view that this will be in the statistics for all," said Gottál.
According to him, between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the Jablonov family's case, she wanted a million crowns each month when she didn't raise her biological daughter.
Veleb served as the basis for the negotiations on the award-winning knowledge assessment prepared by the Faculty Hospital in Prague-Motole.
Children’s parents, according to experts in psychology and psychiatry, suffered psychological damage and stress in different degrees and depths.
The stress situation was better borne by men, even when they were confronted with the impressions that replacements of newborns were not prohibited.
Women are again more likely to cope with the current trauma and what is happening right now, a summary of Veleb’s contents.
Veronica and Nikol exchanged nurses in the Trebian maternity home on December 9th.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to Kermákov to Pribyslavic and Veronica to Libor Brožov and Jaroslava Trojanov to Jablonov.
Heatman Vysočiny Miloš Przečíl handed each of the families of 100,000 crowns at the end of October to compensate for the expenses incurred by them by the fault of the three-year hospital which the country is setting up.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are under the law provided for liability for damage.
In the event of a doubt, they must reach the reserve fund, exceptionally they may request assistance from the founder.
So far, the courts have granted people a relatively low compensation, the sums are calculated according to the tables in the order of the statisans, with the exception of millions of crowns.
The Polish has lost the Kingdom of Wales
Bolek Polivka has lost his dispute over the Valashka kingdom.
According to the judge of the Eastern Regional Court, he used the name of the Walsh King for the first time, but he built a long-term team around Tomáš Harabis, who worked with the actor.
The soup didn't take part today.
According to his lawyer, the case probably doesn't end and the client is calling.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitic to Bolka Polivka's popularity," said Polivkov's lawyer after the trial.
According to him, in the words of the Welsh Kingdom, everyone will be equipped with actors and comics.
He has the same opinion as Harabish.
"There's almost a decade of work behind us.
Hunting money and inventing events," he said.
According to him, there's a lot of money going on.
"After years they realized that the project was successful and could have something to do with it.
They want to paralyze on our work," he added.
Lukrative business
According to the court of appointment, the Walsh king first used Polívka in his television series.
In 1993, she was crowned by the actor Radoslav Fastorichatý.
At that time, however, it was not related to the intention to build a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabis came with the idea of issuing Welsh passports.
From the original recession, trade and lucrative business activity, which Harabis then imposed on the establishment of the Kingdom of Wales, emerged.
In 1997 Polívka agreed to enter his name and signature in passports and even offered a discount to their holders when visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also stated that Harabish only used the bare idea that Polivka had published in the managerial press for his business purpose.
"The popular Boleslav Polish project of the Welsh kingdom certainly helped," the judge said.
But she added that the soul of the project was Harabish and his team, who was actively dedicated to him.
The cooperation of the angry parties today continued until 2000 when Harabis organized official coronation in Vjetina for Poland.
Since then, however, disputes have begun between Polivka and Harabis, which have led to the "King of Boleslav I. chosen for the furthest."
The leading role in the kingdom then took place in the afternoon of Harabis, the singer Jarmila Shuláková, as a queen's mother.
In 2002, Polivka filed a complaint against Harabis and his company, which he rejected today.
Clearly, the dispute could lead to Harabish's planned throne and half of the princess's stake.
A new king should come out of him.
He didn't want to disclose details and terms yet.
"We don't want to make it.
It should be something like a ride of kings to Slovakia.
The King should be elected for a certain time.
Even Mr. Polivka can log in quietly," Harabish added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VT: mispredicting
Actually, I never fantasize about Peugeot 206.
His driving properties were nothing too high, the quality of sorting, handling and also the production could be marked as sub-average.
But there's now a successor to Peugeot 207 on the market, and that's much better.
And a van called SW is still a bit more and I'm not left than to think.
When I tested the classic hatchback Peugeot 207, I complained, for example, about the space on my head in the back seats.
This is the end of the complaint, because the body of the van means they won't suffer in this direction even a two-metre long.
Flying around the world
I'll go through the interior very quickly so I don't repeat myself.
It's a general design where I have the only lead to a poor central tunnel.
Here I'd appreciate something more design invention when the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable, and there are times when we could complain about short seats or bracing.
Also side management has significantly improved against model 206.
As for space, it's here to feel an increase in body size.
Then in the van there's an already mentioned lack of room above the head.
The suitcase will cover.
So the main thing about this car is his trunk.
I have to evaluate it as very well accessible (and thanks to the back window) and as properly consistent.
The sound places are equipped with retaining tires, which are an ideal compromise.
It doesn't prevent it from spreading, and it will keep even more heavy objects.
But let's stop together over the volume.
This is based on the tables in the basic arrangement of 428 l, which is more than an average against competition.
However, not against the most sold car of this class in the Czech Republic - the damage to Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW to the new generation of a young diseased product, then we'll find that Peugeot leaves a lot of 52 liters.
On leave to travel abroad or when loading a carriage, this value is critical.
But if I should raise the positive, then I still have to mention a very straight floor after the second row or very low dust.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a fire extinguisher with a volume of 1,6 l with a power of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, it's supposed to look like a sixteen-year-old who drives a family hatchback.
She's quiet, she's got a little consumption, and she's mostly pulling.
If I compare it to a period of damage that acts like a leaky hadr into the effusion, I can only be excited about it.
Pricer will tell
The price of the car is not human.
However, we must remember that we tested properly equipped cars with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a car with a fire-fighting unit for 329 900 CZK is still going to go.
Our aggregate is 410,900 CZK, which is quite enough.
The tested Premium equipment will then bring the equipment for another 80,000 Kč designs.
But we still had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic driver launch, electrical control of rear windows...
It's just a car worth all of 531,900 CZK.
It's a lot, but you can count the extra equipment at Fabie and you'll get to a lot of similar numbers.
So there's nothing left to decide for the mark.
The integration of Slovenian students into British schools does not succeed
British schools have children from Eastern Europe, which in the case of local residents raises concerns about further development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far been hampered by a number of obstacles.
British schools even register cases where disputes between immigrants and children of the native population are becoming violent.
The problem of integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools well illustrates the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local residents and Slovenian immigrants are beginning to deteriorate.
The quarrels, jokes, and fights between the disciples also moved into relationships between the parents.
The situation went so far that in Chatham, the police kept a Slovenian woman who broke a ten-year-old disciple by a stick of iron.
She's guilty of being insulted by a boy with racist goals.
The police had to attack two noble-year-olds after the attack on the Slovenian immigrant.
Men's girls were supposed to honor racist remarks and throw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy jumped on a bus stop and started swimming on us.
When I told him to let it go, he turned on us with apples and strawberries, and then discovered his ass," described another unpleasant incident for The Times mother of Slovenian disciples.
The complaints are on both sides.
One of the local residents even pointed out disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe to fight for survival.
The above cases show that the atmosphere in British schools between locals and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
There are 70,000 Slovaks registered in Britain who have come here for work.
A crowd of 30,000 Slovene students then attends British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful Caribbean island
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your holiday can happen to you if you choose correctly.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or sea, calm as a fisherman.
Palms and all including artisans offering on the beach pizza, ice cream and side cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find it in a complete and even richer amount.
Only on one island will you find much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
For the Spaniards, Cuba was the garden of their acquisition of America.
Columbus called her the most beautiful place the human eye ever saw.
Havana has become a warehouse and a repository of treasures that the Spanish in America have plundered and transported to Europe.
And then the American era came.
The National Hotel grew up at the very end of the 20th.
He let him build one of the heads of the American Lucky Luciano Mafia, because everything that was a crime in the United States (especially for a ban) was welcomed and supported in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
His guests were mine.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high - school homes grew, after extensive bullfights, cars that belonged to the cult symbols of the 50th century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a settlement in San Francisco de Paula, a piece of Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
On the walls of Bodeguity del Medio, they left their signatures of the star show business and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
On the walls of Havana Bodeguita you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar of the expensive National Hotel, you get mixed up with a cocktail according to your wishes.
And that 50-year-old cult car is driving across Havana so far, because once imported mushrooms and fiats in that salty and wet air have been snorkeling long ago.
Even though Havana, especially her oldest part, is considerably obnoxious, yet nowhere in the area is there as beautiful colonial monuments as it is there.
Other places also turn into beauty, perhaps Trinidad.
Since the travel movement brings so much money, its development is green.
In the last 15 years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varadera, on the coast of the province of Holguín and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another freedom, which is unique in the world and is especially appreciated by the wolves.
A third of the long plantations were connected to sugarcane by narrow pairs and motor trains.
Their car park hasn't been renovated for many decades, so there's a running machine that's been in museums somewhere else.
Where to go?
Most of Cuba's visitors don't miss the most famous places.
So about Varadera or Havana, you don't have to write too much.
I'd just like to remind you that in the Hemingway settlement already mentioned, there's a museum and whoever likes this writer shouldn't let the visit go.
Vináles Valley One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is Vináles Valley in the west of the island.
Boiling vegetation grows from the calcium base.
The moats, the armored homologous, and the rocks rise sharply from the bottom of the valley, and in their tufts there is a humpback ground, which also makes the starry scales covered with dense growth.
The valley is a place where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
With its final form you can meet if you visit any of the Havan factories for the production of douts.
Maybe someone's gonna find it interesting that Major Zeman's Chilean part was going down there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
His business with slaves and sugar brought him glory and wealth.
Wealth turned into the beauty and appearance of a small city.
The colonial Spanish architecture, strongly influenced by later French settlers, has not changed in almost four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray, is such a remote place that in the 50th century there was no road that that country would connect with the rest of the country.
That isolation helped him stay away.
Nothing went there, and that's why nothing went wrong, everyone was happy to have a roof over his head.
If a person has more time on Trinidad than one afternoon, then it is worth looking at interesting places in the vicinity, such as Playa Ancón Beach, or the Sugar Valley.
The evening then belongs to Casa de la Música, which wakes up after the harvest and the music in it is quiet over the morning.
Baracoa
A town in the very east of Cuba some refer to it as the most beautiful on the island.
Such an opinion of the Dozavist affects the road itself.
Both of the roads leading there with the Guantanamo must overcome the high and limbal mountains and pass through a nature almost unknown to human activity.
The eastern island of Cuba was written by UNESCO thanks to its unbroken nature on the list of world heritage.
They're doing the best chocolate there, they have the Columbian cross in the church (in fact it's about a hundred years after the Columbian navigation) and from the hill where the castle stands and today's El Castillo hotel is a few table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, doutinians, the Sierra Maestro hills, the Pigs and the Isle of Isla de Pinos, the Tropican cabaret, the Cuban patron saint Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, the African religions that teach the descendants of former slaves, everything could be described on many pages.
But, as it's called, it's better to see one.
The allies in Afghanistan are passive, hard American
Few soldiers and lack of equipment are affected by the United States during the mission to Afghanistan.
According to NATO Defence Minister Robert Gates, a specific plan should be planned for the next year.
The mission in Afghanistan is not expected, according to estimates, in Scotland the representatives of the countries with units in the southern part of the country agreed.
In addition to increasing resistance from the Taliban movement, eight participating states are also discussing other plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States launched NATO units this week through the Minister of Defence Robert Gates, Great Britain sees a priority in strengthening the Afghan government's authority and strengthening development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is tangible, but military forces can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the citizens to start further economic and security development themselves," British Minister of Defence Des Browne, BBC Station, said.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels has been reported to be the highest by the U.S. Army in the last five years.
The number of violent acts rose by 27 per cent last year, in the southern Helmand province even by 60 per cent.
NATO countries have some 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of which in the southern part of the country.
According to the United States, however, the allies reached the same limit in the organisation and equipment of the units.
They specifically request additional helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about specific goals for the next time and how to achieve them," Gates said.
In a similar way, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop spoke today.
"I'm not happy with what we have in Afghanistan on earth and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's not enough," agency Reuters De Hoop said on the conclusion of the class talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive?
Among the participating countries in recent months, there have also been disputes as to whether all allies are doing the maximum in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticised for its liabilities.
"The Germans in Afghanistan have relatively numerous representations.
However, they are occupied in areas where the minimum of violence and war demands on them are not as high as on us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
This week, the British Sun's bullfighting paper marked German soldiers as lazy.
"Afghan fighters discovered: Germans are playing while our guys are fighting," wrote Sun in material, supplemented by pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
Germany's image of the British unit in the rugby match in southern Afghanistan has been turned into an anti-attack.
State debt will rise to a billion in 2009
Each Czech Republic accounts for over 84,000 crowns in government debt.
The total debt has risen by the end of September to the crown of 842.7 billion.
The government was planning to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to better development of the state budget.
The State debt of the Czech Republic has risen to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
In nine months this year, it has increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
Since June, however, it has been reduced by 13.4 billion crowns.
So today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its data on government debt from the beginning of October.
Every Czechman has a debt of over 84,000 crowns.
Last year, the state owed more than 111 billion crowns.
"For the time being, it seems that due to the lower deficit for next year, we would be able to overcome the billions of crowns by 2009.
Next year the debt should move between 900 billion and a billion crowns," said iHNed.cz analyst Patria Finance David Marek.
Similarly, analyst Next Finance Vladimir Pikora says: "To exceed one billion we could get through 2009.
When exactly will it depend on the next budget that we don't know yet.
If it turned out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could move to 2010.
But I don't expect this change," he said.
Revolving debts
The debt of the State constitutes the debt of the central government and, in particular, results in the accumulation of state budget deficits.
The State debt is financed by treasury notes, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The government's internal debt has risen by 38.5 billion this year to 719.4 billion crowns.
The foreign debt of the state has so far increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The so-called state marketable debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and fell by 13.7 billion crowns since June.
The average payout of the State debt increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased by 13 per cent between year-on-year for the first and third quarters, which is really much about how the economy works.
Interestingly, growth is generated mainly in debt securities, where it is 20 percent.
It is bad that debt is growing, but on the other hand it shows what to deal with when the pension reform is going to be," said Pikora's data.
Better than expected
From the financing and management strategy for 2007 it follows that the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to better development of the state budget.
This part is mainly due to a government budget deficit, which is likely to reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion crowns.
Furthermore, it concerns the planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency of 13.3 billion crowns, the ten-billion-dollar pension reserve, the financing of state debt for 43 billion crowns and the payment of loans from the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion crowns.
The woman is to be brought to court in the Charter today for giving the name to the bear
The British teacher, convicted in Sudan for insulting Islam, was sentenced on Thursday night by one Khartoum tribunal to a 15-week prison and was acquitted, as her lawyer suggested.
The British was accused of letting six to seven-year-old disciples give the bear’s name Muhammad despite the fact that any display of the prophet to Islam is forbidden.
She's been fined for beating wounds.
This four-and-a-half-year-old British teacher, acting at the Unity High School in the Sudan Charter, was arrested at home on Sunday and charged with opposition to Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, after the parents of several disciples complained to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
Our story begins in fact already in September, when the teacher in question asks his six to seven-year-old disciples to choose a name for the class bear.
"Out of the children's mouth eight names, including Hasan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says the school director Robert Boulos.
After the vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children finally choose the most popular name Mohammed.
Of course, Mohammed is the name of a Muslim prophet, but it is, above all, a very widespread Christian name in Sudan.
Then the children created a book for their class with a picture of a bear accompanied by a poem: "My name is Mohamed".
The bear himself had no label on him with that name, but it is in the very image of the prophet considered to be an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, explained that she knew her well and that she would never do anything that could be offensive to any religious faith: "I only regret that she asked the children to vote for some name," according to him, it was only "innocent doubt".
Such an opinion is shared by many disciples of teachers who describe it as "very attentive to their disciples" and say that "never speaks in class about religion".
Note that the Christian name Mohammed is also the second most commonly given Christian name in Britain, in English it is written in fourteen different ways.
This Christian name, often chosen by Muslim families, represents a way of worshiping the prophet (often given to the firstborn).
What, though, are the rules regarding the use of this Christian name?
Is it possible, for example, to give them a toy?
Sure, it's a question of interpretation.
In the last round of this Wednesday's negotiations in Vienna, they did not reach agreement on the future status of the province.
In the end, failure.
The Serbs and Kosovo Albanians finished their sixth and final round of talks on Wednesday morning in the Austrian Baden, while unable to overcome the different views of the future status of this separatist province.
"It is regrettable that both parties were unable to reach the status agreement," European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said during a press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the area is "at stake" and appealed to Belgrade and Pristina to ensure that the security of their commitments remains at peace and were prepared to dialogue even after the end of the negotiations.
"We don't expect violence in the near future, but we enter into a stressful period," he added, "it's obvious that the situation is tense."
The negotiations ended on 10 December.
The troika negotiators, composed of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last move to Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 per cent of the Albanian-speaking population, could be shown in a clearer light by 10 December, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Charchenko should submit their report to the United Nations Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, represent the sixth and at the same time the last round of negotiations since the UN, in August this year, entrusted the Troika with a new negotiation.
Americans and Europeans count on the end of the talks on 10 December.
On the contrary, the Russians who have already blocked Kosovo's independence in the UN Security Council are insisting that the negotiations continue beyond the most horrendous deadline.
"Russia has been and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Bocan-Charčenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of the international community's administration, the West considers Kosovo's independence under EU supervision to be the only step-by-step solution.
Pristina declares that, in the event that the Security Council does not decide for its benefit, it is prepared to declare its independence unilaterally.
Belgrade lasts for extended autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached an agreement," said Fatmir Sejdiu, President of the Kosovo Self-Government at the Baden Hotel, where this "last chance" has been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former Kosovo Albanian rebel chief and future prime minister of the province, expressed regret.
He added, however, that the plan of autonomy presented by Belgrade "is due to the past that led to the killings and deportations".
"Dominic effect"
On the contrary, Serbian President Boris Tadic believes that the compromise is still being considered and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of the unilaterally declared independence of the province.
Belgrade is particularly concerned about the "domain effect" in an area that is still unstable as a result of the wars for independence in the 1990s.
"But it doesn't mean for Serbia," he said, "that compromise is impossible."
In Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions should belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian association has the right to veto.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
"Only solutions brought from the Security Council are acceptable for Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
"This conversation lasted two years.
It must end as it began: on the ground of the Security Council."
Fatmir Sedji answered reporters that "the last word of status will have Kosovo parliament" and added that if there was a unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian speakers, there would be "after agreement" with the West.
Bush made a deal with the Israelis and the Palestinians
At the launch of the International Peace Conference in Annapolis in Maryland, which was approved by its populace, American President George Bush announced that the Israelis and the Palestinians finally agreed to a joint declaration.
He clarified that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas agreed on the immediate commencement of the negotiations with the intention of resolving, once and for all, a lasting dispute between the two nations for 60 years.
In the presence of both men Bush promised to do everything in their power to help them conclude the "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy "terrorist infrastructures" and Israel must end colonial activities, Bush declared and recalled the obligations that both sides had to discharge from the "road map" to the peace they had adopted in 2003.
The Chief of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority led by Abbas aim "to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues without exception, including central issues".
This statement includes three issues that are at the heart of the dispute between Israel and the Palestinians: the future border of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled in the 1948 conflict from their homes in the territory of the present state of Israel.
Abbas took note of the words of the U.S. president and stressed that the subsequent negotiations should be "total and thorough" and that all aspects of the solution should be touched by the mention of "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
Then Olmert made his point that the subsequent negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that it should be "set up to be concluded in 2008".
Bush set the end of 2008 as the deadline for the implementation of its "visa of two states", the Palestinian and the Israeli, which are present next to him.
Saudi Arabia declared that it had taken a commitment from Bush to this end before it decided to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, has initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries, which offers Israel peace by exchange for the abandonment of all Arab territories prohibited for war in 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East especially because it fights against the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", says Prince Saúd in an interview that provided an Arab-speaking newspaper to protected Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutor's office, the police aren't responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As this is always the case with such minor news from the black chronicle, the official version does not agree with what is being said among people.
What are the circumstances of an accident?
According to the first results of the investigation, the French State Police Inspectorate General (Inspection General de la police nationale, IGPN), a police car drove through Louise-Michel Street, Villiers-le-Bel, shortly after the 17th hour of Sunday.
"The vehicle was not in the intervention mode, but it was on the watch and passed at a speed of 40 to 50 km/h, but there were no side lights on," explains the police source.
The green bike Kawasaki, "unregistered, and therefore without permission to drive in public communications" (read below), driven by two young people without access, went "very high speed".
"The motorcycle hit the left to the police car after not giving priority to the news," one police officer said.
The blood alcohol test carried out on the vehicle crew proved negative.
The state of the car (broken front, broken front glass, broken impactors) testifies to the speed of the impact.
The prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (Republique de Pontoise) Marie-Thérèse de Givry responded very quickly and already announced yesterday that IGPN had entrusted the investigation of "the acts of insanity and failure to provide assistance to persons in danger", which is also included in the directorate of the departmental de la súreté publica du Val-d'Oise (the Regional Police Department of Val d'Oise).
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor stated that the investigation of the IGPN leads, at this stage, to exclude the responsibility of police officers for the accident.
Three Witness accidents, which were detailed in the poll on Sunday evening, were confirmed by the official "version of police officers, because the mini-tower approached them relatively quickly to the left".
Some motion, no doubt caused by the three clips of the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles remained locked up until the police car was able to freeze.
The vehicles have been secured and will pass through technical expertise.
There was a drink on the bodies of both victims yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, people were quickly spreading rumors that policemen were supposed to leave the scene quickly without giving the two young people first aid.
IGPN should, in all caution, also exclude "any serious offense" in this point.
"It is a more demanding aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigation and which needs to be very careful," the police said.
The liberation journal met with the obvious witness of those moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows will lead right where the accident took place.
"We immediately went down with the nurse, who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to resurrect them," this witness said.
I couldn't do anything."
Then he saw the "dreaming, totally scared cop.
Two others tried to resurrect one of the young and the fourth spoke on the phone."
Faced with the rapidly increasing tension and the certainty that the situation of young people is hopeless, police officers were taken away by car colleagues who had come to the scene in the meantime.
According to the same witness, the rescue arrived "about 20 minutes after the police took off."
They also had a heart massage, but empty.
"Let no one claim that the police authorities did not hurry to help young people.
First aid was given to these young people.
The Hassites have arrived immediately.
Everything has been done for their salvation," the prosecutor stressed.
The tension in Pakistan is growing
On Monday, the Pakistani police suppressed the first demonstration of the state of emergency by General Musharaf, two days earlier.
In Lahor, east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against measures taken under exceptional conditions were injured by grenades with tear gas, which, according to the witnesses, were used by orderly forces.
The last appointment was answered with a stone, which was damaged by several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were summoned.
Similar scenarios as in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where policemen attacked and injured lawyers.
Several of them should have been summoned.
In Islamabad, lawyers of the Supreme Court called after general station and announced demonstrations, resulting in about five hundred arrests of opponents, human rights fighters and lawyers during the weekend.
The access streets to the Supreme Court were replaced on Monday morning in order to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations were to take place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (Northeast).
On Monday, lawyers gained support from the religious parties gathered in the political alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president "received the population to send flowers to the judges who stood up against the exceptional state and to the wastes to those who took an oath before Musharaf".
"Man's promise doesn't pay."
Pakistan's Supreme Court is the direct target of the extraordinary measure announced on Saturday evening.
The next few days were due to express the legal re-election of President Musharaf in an indirect presidential election that took place on 6 October.
Judge Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry was removed and replaced.
"All that we witness is illegal, constitutional and against Supreme Court judgments," the official said in The News.
The promise by Parvíze Musharaf that he will give up the army and become a civilian president "not paying" after the establishment of an exceptional state, the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azem announced on Monday.
It was expected to surrender military uniforms by 15 November, when he completed his first presidential mandate.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the cold elections could be postponed.
In other words, the Pakistani government has also reversed the country's ongoing speculation, according to which the army chief's representative had to order President Musharaf's house arrest.
More than a third of pregnancy continues to produce unexpected pregnancies
This budget includes unwanted pregnancies (24 %), as well as poorly planned or created in an unexpected way.
More than one pregnancy out of three (36%) is still unexpected today, a study conducted by the French Institute of National Studies of Demographics (Ined)- the State Institute of Demographic Studies, forty years after the adoption of the Neuvirth Act, which has been anti-conception in France.
This budget includes unwanted pregnancies (24 %), as well as poorly planned or created in an unexpected way.
Various methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraceptives or sterilization, still show 5% to 6% of the failure rate, Ined estimates.
However, anti-concept legislation has only enabled better "fertilisation control", the Constitution states and notes that the rate of use of hormonal contraceptive in women aged between 20 and 44 has now reached 60% from 5% in 1970.
Finally, eight births out of ten today are well planned.
One couple of five has even been born for a month exactly and if possible in spring, which is considered the most pleasant annual period for the birth of a child.
Observational repair of space station
Over seven hours of space work needed astronaut Scott Parazynski and members of his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) to make a remarkable repair of the fragmented solar panel needed for further scientific activity of the station.
It was a risky exit into the universe that collected records of the duration, distances from the residential modules, the speed with which the "cautiousness" was planned and the dimensions of which the astronauts had spent on repair.
The problems appeared on Tuesday, while astronauts from Discovery explained the Harmony module, a large military service designed to install a European and Japanese scientific laboratory (see box).
This module is some kind of landing mole for modules-laborators.
But you need to be able to supply electricity.
Therefore, the second task of the crew was to move the seventeenth generation module of electricity using solar panels already on the ISS so that it could quantify in its final position.
After moving it, the crew started disbanding the seventy-metre solar panels of the module.
And in it was one of the panels that decomposed as a pulling harmony, as a result of the attachment of the cable, damaged on the surface without a single meter.
Disposal was suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts who were originally supposed to carry out a control exit on the Discovery ship and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system had a malfunction were forced to devote to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazinski who was chosen to fly to the end of the robot shoulder of the ship, added to the shoulder of the station, and made repairs.
It is one of the best "spacewalkers" (space walker) of the U.S. Aviation and Space Agency (NASA).
High, static, very vice versa, has a very elaborate chest and long blades.
In his 46 ’ s, this original call was entrusted to a doctor by "operating" a "damaged" solar panel.
After carefully investigating the damage, he cut off the faulty cable and fixed the damaged places like "dlaha".
Another spacewalker was helping him stay close to the balancing chamber, as well as inside, other astronauts, including Peggy Witson, the commander of the crew.
The tools he used, therefore, were designed to prevent electroshocks on solar panels producing several hundred volts and made astronauts on board the station "after slaughter".
After the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was fully deployed and then invented his tools and returned to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon the astronauts enjoyed a half-day rest before today, when seven astronauts return to the Discovery ship to return to Earth on Wednesday, as planned.
EADS shares weaken
The EADS shares will lose significantly on the Paris Stock Exchange after this airline operating in the aviation and defence industry has announced that it will have to spend 1,2 to 1.4 billion euros in order to face the delay of the A400M aircraft.
EADS has lost 4% and is now on the Paris Stock Exchange for 21,96 euros.
The financial group was forced to reassess its expected production results for 2007 as a result of the delays resulting from the slow progress of the A400M aircraft engine development, which is a condition for the start-up flight.
The price for the reduction of delays in the delivery of military cargo aircraft, announced in October, was numbered "at EUR 1.2 billion to 1.4 billion, of which more than one billion for Airbus", the parent company of the European construction company EADS announced.
For these costs, the EADS will be forced to announce a new profit view before deducting interest and tax (EBIT) on the next Thursday when presenting its quarterly results.
The group also stated that the new cost estimate corresponds to a six-month delay.
Note that the production results of EADS in 2006 fell by 86%, in particular due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, namely the A380 aircraft.
The group initially assumed that the first delivery of A400M to the French army would be in October 2009.
Decision on the status quo
Sunday's elections will take place without a tense expectation: the Russians will mostly elect President Putin's party, the United Russia.
Confirming this, only after the completion of a very few free election campaign, its commitment to stability, was to authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the elections to the parliamentary chamber, Russian President Vladimir Putin will inform the voters at the public law stations of a broadcast of a television message, but the content of which is kept secret.
It does so from the position of the leader of the United Russia, the pro-Cremal Party, who celebrates a victory that is, according to all, achievable.
Yesterday, when he received ambassadors from foreign states, the president let nothing out of him and satisfied himself with another attack on the West accused of interfering - his favorite theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and we wish to be honest, perhaps the most transparent and unreliable elections, the choices without any mistake on beauty," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, it's not far from that.
They condemn the campaign with various pressures.
The leader of the communists Gennadi Zjuganov says that "there has never been such a dirty election, not even for Jelcina".
After the repression of last week's demonstrations, the former world champion in the Garry Kasparov chess, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, according to his lawyer, has continued to ban visits.
"The Russians remain a gay Soviet mentality"
In the background of these parliamentary elections of simple tense expectations, two far more open questions are raised:
- "Who will become Putin's successor to the presidential office?
The Official Journal published yesterday the date of the first round of presidential elections, 2 March 2008; public candidates can be represented by 23 December.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot strive for a third round.
However, no follower appears.
- "What role will Putin play after March?"
Will he be the first?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful party of the United Russia, who chooses the government and the president?
Whether this is the case or not, the ruling power will win the whole series in the parliamentary elections, as well as in the presidential elections.
It's tradition.
"The Russians remain a gay Soviet mentality, they do not feel to be masters of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent centre of Levada.
The history of Nikolai Kokossov from the State University of St. Petersburg notices a time-consuming relationship: the civil society, in this country baptized five centuries after Europe, delayed the creation of individualism; that famous common spirit delayed the creation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the '90s, Putin imposed on a paternist state model, perfectly accepted by the population, rather than through terror, but some economic benefit," says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
The Russians today " voluntarily give up their personal responsibilities", which they briefly demonstrated after the collapse of the USSR.
"Why think?"
This phenomenon concerns all kinds of society, including the business world.
The official elite also intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (a total of 85 heads of Russian regions) run local candidates from the United Russia.
New freedoms taken from the West are often, as in the 1990s, synonymous with chaos.
Public opinion gives priority to stability.
Also on behalf of stability, the Russians will not vote for extremists.
The conclusion of Tamara Cherednikka, 40-year-old professors: "Why think?
Those in power aren't so bad, so why change them?"
Heavy Memory
After more than sixty years in a confidential regime, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which count the fates of 17.5 million victims of Hitler's regime, open up to the public.
To date, 47 million archived documents stored in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) have been available only for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. individually and specifically, at the request of the former victim or its authorized persons.
Eleven States entrusted with the management of archives - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
In view of the fact that the ratification process for this agreement by all States is at the end, the opening yesterday was effective.
Other information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow us to examine "particularly the movement of prisoners, the population of camps and the state of health of forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (International Committee of the Croix-rouge, ICRC).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, have opposed access to these nominee public documents because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
What are the assumptions of homosexuality or mental impairment of some victims of deportation.
The registers of concentration camps or Gestape detainees were gathered after the war for practical purposes to find deported or forced work by sub-citizens, to give them proof of their detention with a view to opening the way for their compensation.
Today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen deal with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen represents only a limited benefit.
"Nothing new can be expected from these documents in principle," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Centre for the study of antisemitism of the Berlin Technische Universität.
The EU and India want to reach free trade agreements in 2008
At present, bilateral trade between Europe and India has reached almost EUR 60 billion annually.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect the signing of the Free Trade Agreement in 2008, announced by European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
Last April, EU Foreign Ministers provided the European Commission with a Green Paper to initiate negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asia (Asean) with a view to signing free trade agreements. Bilateral trade between Europe and India is now reaching almost 60 billion euros annually.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, however, India is, according to the European Commission, up to the ninth EU trading partner.
"The Free Trade Agreement is enormously superior to both economies" and "India is gaining better access to the market for 450 million prosperous Europeans," said Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported to India, the European Commissioner clarified. The Asian and European giant, together with the annual exchange of "47 billion euros in goods" and "ten billion euros in services", said Danièle Smadja this week, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its full potential". The EU and India meet at the eight joint diplomatic summit in New Delhi on Friday, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President of the European Commission José Manuel Dura Barroso.

The English bank raised concerns and offered 10 billion pounds in a five-week auction
On Thursday, the English bank announced its intention to mitigate the current concern that conditions on the credit market would again deteriorate and announced a bid of 10 billion pounds in a five-week auction at a basic interest rate of 5,75 %, which is not usually valid for long.
"In an effort to ease the fears that the conditions on the financial markets will be very favourable at the end of the year and to give banks greater security in the way to secure their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserve during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation," the Communication stated.
The Bank explains that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will thus be placed on the financial market on 6 December at 12.15 GMT until 10 January at the basic interest rate.
It appears that this is the first time BOE is pumping cash on the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
They usually last a week.
The BOE submits in its communication that "remains prepared to take further measures to maintain interest rates on an annual basis" of interbank loans at the same level as its basic rate.
The average interbank interest rate was 5,829 % on average.
The three-month interest rate was set at 6,6 %, which is the highest since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the annual financial crisis, the amounts placed on the financial market by the English bank have been linked to the rates of charges that banks have set aside from the use of this offer.
According to certain speculations reinforced by the evolution of the pound rate towards the euro, many have preferred to decide on the amounts placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and guaranteed discretion.
UMP (Union pour un movement populaire, Union for People's Movement) and NC (New Centre, New Centre) refuse to take up socialist proposals (PS) on purchasing capacity
The UMP and Nouveau Centre Clubs refused to discuss on Thursday the individual paragraphs of the socialist proposal of the law on purchasing capacity, which is the same as rejecting the text.
On the agenda, the text of the bill was received within the framework of the so-called socialist 'nil' (meetings initiated by the individual parliamentary club) and contained a dozen measures taken by the PS Presidency Tuesday, including an increase in the employment premium of 50 %, the renewal of the rolling TIPs, the transport check or the regulation of rent.
In view of the fact that the UMP and the NC voted against the individual paragraphs (180 votes to 115), the meeting was concluded after a general debate, which took place on the occasion of an exchange of views, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition, several hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's TV performance on purchasing capacity.
The Chief of the Members of the PS Jean-Marc Airault announced that his club would re-submit these proposals in their entirety in the form of supplements to the proposed amendment of the Finance Act to be discussed next week.
A new festival is born
As a result of many speculations that C3 Presents in Philadelphia is setting up a new festival, this promoter/producer Vineland Festival in New Jersey announced in cooperation with the Festival of the Republic of Britain's composer Melvin Benn.
"For our company it is an honor to work with a man who has inspired the current festival movement in America without any effort," said Charlie Jones from the C3 Billboard.com server.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza festival and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland in New Jersey is the summer camper's target station.
The festival should take place from 8 to 10 August on a private farm with a distance of 500 acres, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic Festival, previously known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most famous festival organizers.
In 1989, the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people each year, was launched.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added to his portfolio Leeds Festival, and in 2006, Festival Republic founded the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
As early as 2002, Melvin Benn, as a co-owner, also has the responsibility for production, licensing and organisational tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which currently has up to 177 500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 marks Glastonbury as "the most inspiring event", which he has ever experienced and says his company and company Melvin Benn are working together to give the region a European-style festival event.
"At first we chose Philadelphia as a market, and together with Fairmount Parks Commission, we worked hard to set up a festival in the centre of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"I had a meeting with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about the project.
Unfortunately, however, because of the current leadership of the city, we have become involved in politics, says Charlie Jones.
" Fortunately we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Ben and we are going to set up a great festival in an exceptional place, which will eventually serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents in 2005 set up the Lollapalooz festival in the Chicago Grant Park, after which in 2002 they staged the festival stage by organizing the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The rough markets of both events for 2007 amounted to $9.8M and $11.3M.
Both festivals take place in the city environment.
"The European model of the Melvin Benn festival takes place in the countryside, while our festivals take place in green areas in the cities," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to tie both concepts in a certain way so that we create both the impression of a rural festival after Europe and the city after America."
Vineland is located about half the way between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"Obbec Vineland, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the realization of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, however, "they are useful enough to enable them to invest in such an event and welcome the festival that will have, hopefully, a long duration".
Charlie Jones says that the capacity of this festival is "very high", similar to the capacity of Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which includes 80,000 people.
He says that the groups have already received invitations, but nothing can yet be confirmed when the program is just being printed.
"Vineland will have rock blasts, but music will be there, but there will be a festival to attract if possible a wide range of spectators," says Carlie Jones.
The partners of C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter award in the last year of the Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal Head of Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal when the Terminator himself...
This Convinced Mission is one of the delegates' tasks.
However, his mandate is "politically demanding" because the Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runaway productions".
Is it hard to fall "Governor" into the traps?
"You have to be careful, it's the industry that decides where to go.
If he finds the conditions in Montreal are favorable, he'll go there.
Our role is to offer what they will consider to be the best," he said.
Festival hunting
For the moment, however, Denise Turcotte is a priority for the promotion of local film.
The hunt for Oscars has already begun.
At all festivals of the West Coast, whether it's festivals in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it's about presenting Quebec films, warning them and ensuring that directors provide interviews.
The age of darkness had good publicity a few weeks ago at the 30th anniversary of the Mill Valley Film Festival.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on offer in Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th anniversary of the Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month Québec also presented four short films and four all-night films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is it coming at the end of the year on the stock exchange to the marathon? Experts divided the 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks remain until the end of the administrative year, and the investors have already given me their hands to expect a traditional marathon at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts are not so sure that he will.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock exchange is positive".
However, it is not intended to create predictions solely on the basis of statistics, especially because, in the current market context, certain doubts are considered, at least in the short term."
These experts do not assume that the stock exchange has shifted over the past few weeks and state that "the stock market is maintained by existing liquidity, which is willing to invest in the absence of collateral alternatives, especially a strong revenue impacted by a return on quality securities, both in long and short segments".
Therefore, it is believed that the stock exchange will have a more peaceful course, not without volatility, "primarily because it is not aware of the impact of the likely fall in EDF rates (Federal Reserve System), given the high level of oil prices and the risk of inflationary pressures".
Javier Barrio, who is leading the sale of the BPI bank in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time for a bold statement that he is coming to the marathon.
"There's not too much reason for joy," this expert assures.
Ibex lost almost 4% of the maximum values recorded on 8 November when the index closed at 15 945.7 points.
However, all experts do not have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, Intermoney analyst, is of the opinion that Ibex 35 could complete a year of something more than 16,000 points due to the re-buying of portfolios and traditional contributions to the pension insurance that occurs each year at this time.
However, this expert suggests that this year everything will be slightly different, because it is thought that the marathon will arrive early, in the second week of December after the extended weekend on the occasion of the Constitution Day.
The said analyst does not assume that volatility would affect the direction of the market.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at the Reverses Banco, also estimates that we are approaching a technical level and "so we could observe the reflection of the index caused by US reports of the consequences of the credit crisis".
The analyst believes that these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree in the selection of titles that they make sure to bring Ibex to the new maximum angles.
Solana from Intermoney confirms that "this year is a series of strong titles".
This expert would include both large banks and some construction companies in the portfolio, "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive".
Federico Oluch of the Reverses Banco, on the other hand, ensures that growth will go hand in hand with banking and the industrial sector.
Construction companies will also be able to build on this marathon if it comes to it.
"ACS has been in position for several months and we hope that other construction companies, such as Ferrovial and FCC, will go the same way," explains the expert.
cyclical consumption will be in advance in the last part of the year due to an increase in sales during the Christmas sale period.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that technology will also be very good, even though they are not represented on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has been only in two cases a month of failure.
A real marathon at the end of the year took place in 2003, in the year in which the stock markets ended the crisis caused by the collapse of the technological bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 regained 28.17%, December saw an increase of 6.68%.
We will see whether 2007 will be the fifth profit year (Ibex has since January increased by 8.36%) and whether it will succeed in having its marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred bank branches Popular will have opened 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
The Popular Bank has decided to modernise most of its branches.
A total of two hundred located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the Popular Max brand are a big change for the bank.
Also for other Spanish entities, because it is the first group that decided to make such a jump and bet on the continuous opening time of its branches up to 20.30 hours and open on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 20.30 p.m.
BBVA, another group that has also repeatedly ensured that it wants to extend the opening time of its branches, has not decided to this step.
In the meantime, it intends to conclude an agreement with the opening-up committees of 75 % of its branches on Saturday exchange for the extension of the opening-up period by one afternoon, although not for the public.
The results of this experience of the Popular Bank will be crucial for other entities to join or not to support the opening trading period.
That's exactly the purpose of the project that the Popular Bank came up with.
To get individual customers who spend in these places after their purchases, small and medium-sized companies, traders and shops from the selected streets where you can open branches.
The Bank wants to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain for about 18 months, as this is not about opening new branches, but only about adjusting existing ones.
For this reason, the bank is modernising branches already in its business areas by adapting them to the customer profile in individual streets.
This is complemented by the extension of the opening time by a different termation of the branch space and by a new, more up-to-date design in brighter colors.
The manager of the Bank of Ángel Rivera ensures that this restructuring will not mean a large investment, but a larger set of staff, as it moves from six employees to a branch of eight to nine.
Branches will even be equipped with meeting rooms for small and medium-sized enterprises and will also sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
The Popular Bank has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as Angel River explains.
The branches were chosen in the Madrid streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía and according to Rivera it seems that it was a happy choice.
Banka Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And the other 60 specializing in immigrants who are operating under the Mundocredit brand also has a very long opening time and is open even on Sundays and holidays.
PopularMax branches will not follow the BBVA model when a number of its branches offer a large range of non-financial products for sale.
"We don't want to compete with our clients," says Rivera.
They just agreed with Telefónico to sell their cell phones through external personnel.
Telecinco for the first time on the stock exchange doubled the value of its rival Antenna 3
We did it.
In this sentence, Paolo Vasile, Executive President Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the conclusion of the trade, when he found that the television he was driving doubled the value of his rival Antena 3.
Only one thing said his joy: 'What I'm sorry is that it didn't happen because we were growing up, but because we've fallen less,' he said.
And then he stressed that thanks to the weak market, we've fallen less.
Telecinco finished trading yesterday by 2,54 %.
This profit increased their loss over the past part of the year to 15,66 %.
The stock exchange value of this company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% capital) with Vocenta (other 13%) thus reaches EUR 4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg.
Her rival Antenna 3, which dropped by 1.52% yesterday and decreased by 40.5% since January, has a half-value of 2 193.46 million.
The value of the other telecommunications companies that have been assessed amounts to 3,571 billion in the case of Sogecable, 2,518.53 million Prisa (publisher Cinco Días) and 1.779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasila, comparison with Antenna 3 is offered because 'we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do this on the same market, at what cost and how we assess it in the follow-up'.
Telecinco announced last week that this year he is counting on over a billion gross advertising revenues to become the first television channel, as Giuseppe Tringali, executive president of Telecinco and Publiespaña, said.
If the predicted data were actually achieved, this television channel would record an increase in turnover of 3,6 % compared to 965,4 million this year.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, the net turnover of antenna 3 increased by 1.6% (and reached 734.4 million), while net revenues of this television increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts focus on for the best relative development of Telecinco on the stock exchange is an increased payout which has so far been maintained: in 2006 this company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarría, divided its shareholders by 100 % of its profits.
Vasile ensures that although it is to be decided soon, this coefficient could change after buying 33 % of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
'We have an official obligation to give at least 50%, although we've always announced a lot more.
This year I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, which we have already raised the value of 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market at these times shows a certain degree of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimate to Telecinco by 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is due to the fact that the projected revenue growth from 0,5 % to 8,4 % in 2008 and from 5,5 % to 5,1 % in 2009.
That company reduced the expected profit of Antenna 3, which was 4,5 % in 2008 and 7,5 % in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities: recommends the purchase of both titles, in particular on the basis of an increased yield for dividends and a sustainable potential for the long term.
2.
Caja Madrid: values better Telecinco (collect) than Antenna 3 (keep) due to its 'read preference' and growth in trade.
3.
JPMorgan: In both cases, it recommends not to assess them because they face 'like threats' (the overarching market and the deteriorating economic environment).
Congress approved MiFID transposition as of 1 November
Consistent with the parliamentary proceedings which were concluded today by the Congress on developments in the Senate's draft law, the government has informed the public hearing of a regulation that is developing a new law in order to both enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of each party have consistently raised the efforts of Members and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard to guarantee investor protection and detailed regulation of the activities of the entities necessary for the efficient functioning of the markets.
The MiFID Directive, which governs the Securities Trading Act, provides for the modernisation of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, enhances the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and supports cooperation between the individual supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation will allow financial advisory services to be provided to specialised companies, natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial services provider (ESIS), financial advisory companies (AFI) that join the company with securities, brokerage offices with securities and the company managing the portfolio.
In addition, the number of financial instrument operating systems is extended by joining the regulated secondary markets with multilateral trading systems and order internalisation systems that will compete with current stockbrokers.
The law further obliges investment service providers to disseminate on the market information on the key aspects of their commercial profile, exposure to risk and risk-relieving methods and requires a list of all operations carried out to simplify supervision by the CNMV.
In the course of negotiations with the Congress Trade Commission, several adjustments were included, including the fact that the securitised claims were considered a "complicated" financial instrument due to the high risk to the investor, which was proven by what occurred in the US with high risk mortgages (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the Directive was used to legalise the functions that bakers may hold in the economics and management sector 30 years after the Royal Decree was passed in 1977, which lists the professional functions reserved for the economy.
At the same time, the Senate has arranged for the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an external broker who will not require permission from the CNMV and will be able to provide product trading and customer acquisition services for different investment firms at the same time.
Harmonised ISC increased by five decimal places to 4.1 % in November
This indicator, which is later used by Eurostat to calculate the European Union's inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices developed in Spain during November.
Its publication is in line with the policies of Eurostat and the Central European Bank (ECB) to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator shall be calculated using the same process as used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using different statistical modelling methods for the estimation of information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (State Institute for Statistics) recalled that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is only indicative and therefore does not have to be necessarily consistent with the final data that will be published on 14 December of this year.
"ISC will continue to maintain at a relatively high level"
The second Vice-President of the government and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes said that the November increase in ISC to 4.1% was "temporary", however, he predicted that the price index would continue to be at a relatively high level in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes in the Congress rounds stated that "even if it is not a positive number", the Spanish inflation differential towards the monetary union is still "more or less" in the last two years.
He also explained that November was "less surprising" than the previous month when the government didn't count with such a high rise.
"We expected a value of around 4%," said the Minister of Economy to date.
Virgin is going to make a plan with Northern Rock 42 billion euros in three years.
Since Northern Rock got into the crisis in mid-September and had to withdraw to an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have dropped by more than 50% to 12 billion pounds (16.8 billion euros).
At that time, the Bank has fixed record deposits worth more than 25 billion pounds, which have gradually fallen over two and a half months, despite the fact that the government has offered a percentage guarantee for this money and is extending it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who replaces the entity with her commercial brand Virgin Money, needs to get around a quarter of the revenues invested in British banks over the next three years to get the remaining 18 billion pounds and thus reach a target of 30 billion.
Richard Branson's magnet group, known in the United Kingdom for its supposed advertising campaigns, plans to lose 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually for advertising and marketing to reach its presidency.
The Bank of Northern Rock this week marked a consortium of Virgins, which consists of three other companies, such as those that give priority to saving them from bankruptcy.
Mayor Totany arrested for alleged corruption practices in construction
The civilian guard today, in the early hours of the morning, detained the current mayor of the Murcia city of Totan (the People's Party) for his alleged involvement in corrupt practices in the construction that was discovered this week.
In addition, one of the local police chief's secretaries was arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, the current national MP and until then the mayor of the village, who could be the 'head' of the entire company, according to the investigative sources of Cadena SER.
Police continue to monitor the buildings of the town council and the construction commission and no further arrests will be excluded in the next few hours.
In addition, a lawyer named Juan Morales, the chief suspect of corruption practices, was accused of building that was discovered at the beginning of this week.
As Cadena SER, a lawyer of the 'human' MP Juan Morales, who was checked yesterday, reportedly arrested while leaving Morales' residence with important documents related to corruption.
According to the investigation sources, it is also the subject of the investigation of Morales' alleged selection of commissions for his signature of the construction agreement with the Galicia construction company, which reclassified 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently detained.
Bono accepted the offer to be led by the Toledo candidate PSOE and, if they win, to chair Congress
Former Defence Minister José Bono accepted the offer of the government president and social secretary-general José Luis Rodríguez Zapater to stand in the next general election in front of the candidate list PSOE (Spain's Socialist Party) in Toledo and in case the socialists win the general election, he became the president of Congress.
So at the press conference, PSOE secretary for José Blanco and Bono himself announced this after meeting with Zapater, who took place this afternoon in the federal headquarters of the party.
The chief executive of the bid to the former minister has justified that in political life "it is important to count with the best" and Bono "is among the best".
He further noted that "yes, it seems," that this policy from La Mancha will be the candidate of the Socialist Party for the President of Congress, if the Socialists win in the next elections.
As President of Congress, Bono would replace Manuel Marín, who published his decision on 15 November not to hold elections in the next general election and leave his active political career in order to engage in the fight against climate change in university education.
The former minister admitted that the president of the government constantly insisted on him to return to the top policy he left two years ago.
He further stated that as well as citizens, he knew who would be the Deputy Minister of Economy, if the PSOE won the election, his party wanted to announce as "transparent form" who would chair Congress.
If Bono gets this function, he hopes that he will turn the House of Respect and not a goal or a cry and that he will "more and more like the citizens".
"It seems, unfortunately, that the only place in Madrid where it is not possible to speak in peace is Congress, the President of the Senate on one occasion interrupted 26 times."
Similarly, he addressed the current President Manuel Marín and "his good work" and did not wish to imagine himself in his place so as not to diminish himself to what his opponents might think of as "great".
Climate propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is fuelled by cruel persecution, both those who look at its predictions sceptically and those who give priority to other political and social struggles must show strong consistency.
Moreover, the leader of the movement, who is the president of the government like Zapatero, believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign "a new treaty with the planet".
This proposal requires an explanation of why the activity or inaction of its government has contributed significantly to Spain's failure to implement the Kyoto Protocol in the European Union.
Who is responsible for this failure, in which sectors this is happening and why his government, the treaty government, did not prevent it.
In addition, it forces him to explain to the Spanish as clearly as possible what measures he intends to take to defuse climate change.
Which companies will be damaged by this, which population habits will have to be changed, which energy savings, individual and collective, we will have to accept and which will have economic consequences.
In other words, who sacrifices and who pays to save the planet.
But we didn't wait for such explanations, nor did we.
Just because you have to sacrifice and pay.
Climate change measures, real measures, are not popular.
Dear, uncomfortable and threatening business and private accounts.
Even one cent of the price of petrol, proposed by the PSOE (Spain's Socialist Workers' Party), seemed so risky to Zapater from the point of view of the election that he quickly rejected it.
In other words, it is to save the planet in such a way that it is nothing, pure propaganda, passwords that lose any real meaning.
Effective phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And by agreements with the planet. This gentleman is so useful to the election campaign that he doesn't even speak, blames, demands nothing, but he's a traitor to the meetings, and he stirs it up.
If it's restricted to being just a virtual contracting party and it doesn't want us to ride the wheels and cool with the wind.
Mayor and local police chief Totany detained for suspected corruption in construction
According to the investigative sources, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of the Murtician city of Totan, "people" of José Martinez Andreo, chief of the local police, secretary of the council and one of the host companies, for suspicion of committing criminal offences during the construction.
The mayor was arrested in his residence and transferred to a councillor in whose premises he is now located along with a number of police officers who have also arrived at the Commission for Construction and the City Enterprise for Industrial Land and Housing.
These three arrests came to the sixth, which occurred last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation involving the retraining of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land on the ground so that the Galicia firm Nuaria could build 4,000 houses after the payment of illegal commissions during the last election period.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested, but were charged with a short trial before the court of the first instance of the city of Totana.
Six first detainees were brought to trial today.
According to information sources, the former Mayor of Totany and today a member of the Autonomous Parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales, is being investigated.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, the owner of the real office, was accused of being registered today in Totana and also his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous region.
Manuel N. A., director and owner of the Nuaria group, a lawyer and businessman from Viga, was arrested in Niger (Pontevedra province), as well as Pablo José M. G., director of the company Suelo de Immonauar, which is part of that group and is subject to payment.
The investigation shall be carried out by a criminal group in the construction of the Civil Guard Operations Centre, whose members, in addition to the arrest, also carried out eleven visits, mostly in companies related to the arrested, with a residence in Madrid, Vigu, Murcia, Pontevedre, Las Rozas (in Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was imprisoned in Totana, a very well-known owner of poultry meat products that could serve as a mediator.
The Nuaria group was entrusted with the position of the largest residential complex in Totana, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 homes, golf course and two hotels with "sleep".
The company acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana, which was re-qualified and its project was to double the settlement of a village with 25 000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonauar, which support the real estate market, Conycase, which runs parking in the streets of Coruna, Venezuela and in the square of Fernando el Católica in Vigo, Hogartel, which focuses on direct marketing and Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and assembly of building elements.
That's what happens.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from yesterday's release of the most important Finnish news Helsingin Sanomat (by the way at the beginning of the PISA's report on the level of education in the world), which addresses what the newspapers printed on 18 November, on the same day when the circumstances there also revealed the criticism of Blackburn's book:
"The content of the subject of philosophy went into public discussions in connection with the tragedy at school in Jokela.
The victim's killer, a high school student, quoted in his messages the work of Plato and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, the school council responsible for the subject of philosophy, requested on the pages of the journal Helsingin Sanomat that the professors take a critical view of Plato and argue that Nietzsche should not be discussed in the compulsory basic course of philosophy in secondary schools."

One colleague shall inform you of the introduction of a criminal offence of downloading from the Internet into a criminal law:
A. Downloading one song would be a criminal offence with a rate of six months to one year.
On the other hand, when you cut the price of a plate in the store below 400 euros, it is considered a mere offence (§ 623.1).
B. If you cut up to 1,000 euros in the store, theft is already a crime, but the criminal rate is lower than the download (§ 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is even lower than when you download it (§ 244.1)
D. It is less important to participate in fights than to change the packages.
Participation in the expulsion has a rate from three months to one year (§ 154 of the Penal Code) and for the exchange of compacts the rate from six months to two years would be
(Section 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment in employment is considered to be less serious under § 184.2 of the Criminal Code than downloading the film to DVD.
F. The unauthorized distribution of copyright-protected films is vice-punished rather than the provision of pornographic materials to young people (§ 186).
So if my colleague's not wrong, she caught someone's hand, and that's right.

My curative doctor is giving me one of his articles on strange research called "Money causes brain activation, especially if others get less."
Feelings that cause monthly pay for employees do not depend on how much colleagues earn.
The research was carried out at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonance on a tomography and the results are published in the latest issue of Science magazine.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and lead group Viewing the neurologic Institute of Life&Brain in Germany: "The biggest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his colleague was wrong."
Researchers observed that if both were successful, they received the same salary, the activation was mild, but when one got a double, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
Claims against the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly persecuted by the State Prosecutor's Office of the Court of Justice in The Hague by the Balkan War Crimes for eight years.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year, and Carla will leave with mixed feelings because the main perpetrators of the massacre in Srebrenica, where 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on the list, from which the Swiss documentary film director Marcel Schüpbach "Karlin List" (2006, not mentioned in Spain), which follows the pace of the detective thriller from Belgrade to New York the work of the Swiss prosecutor in the prosecution of fugitive criminals and pressure on the relevant states to withdraw the network.
What kind of insurance is appropriate to me?
Car insurance which protects the driver in case of an accident. represents a significant expenditure which depends on various factors such as age, status, sex, length of driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right vehicle insurance is even more difficult than choosing the car model.
First of all, we need to clarify what we're talking about.
The insurance of a vehicle is an agreement between an insurer and an insurer.
This commitment shall take the form of an insurance contract, which shall provide that the insurance undertaking receives the agreed amount of the insurance amount to a certain extent for taking care of the payment damages in the event of an insurance event.
Insurance is the price of the insurance which is determined taking into account the various factors such as age, status, sex, length of holding the driving licence, the type of vehicle which is insured or its use, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both persons over 25 years of age and women must pay lower insurance because statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
In the same way, on the basis of controls, insurance companies concluded that marriage mates have less accidents than free drivers.
The mode of use of the vehicle will affect the frequency of the vehicles, thus likely to have an accident.
The increase in the frequency of driving increases the probability.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when setting the price of insurance.
Therefore, the driver must carefully study the situation in order to choose the type of insurance that best fits his insurance profile.
We will show here the most important variable for the choice of the type of insurance which, in addition to the type of insurance, will be at reasonable price.
People under the age of 50 are faced with various disadvantages, such as little experience in driving and short driving if they want to sit securely at an affordable price.
Although the ideal for good coverage is insurance against all risks, there are also cheaper options.
The more careful drivers can choose insurance against all risks by discounting the insured in such a way as to obtain insurance coverage of all risks but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would assume the participation of the client in the payment of the insurance event.
"The part of the benefit of the insurance event that the client will provide will be determined in advance when determining the price of the insured, which will be higher, than the lower participation," explains Luis Noguera, the chief executive of First Europe in Spain, the Internet insurance intermediary.
Another option is to extend the insurance to other operators so that the customer will ensure against damage caused to other persons, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, he would be insured against theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Recommendation.
If you are under twenty-five years old, try to be careful and avoid accidents, as it is only possible, because it will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce insurance in the future.
The bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the insurance company has.
On the contrary, the small is the increase in the said basic rate.
"Bonus and the small will depend on the insurance and its profits.
If the insurance company has a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonus," Noguera explains.
After exceeding the limit of twenty-five years, it is easier for drivers to take insurance because the client's risk index is decreasing due to the experience they have acquired.
For this reason, it is highly recommended to settle insurance against all risks with a discount.
"You know, young people can't usually take advantage of the experience they've gained before when an accident comes, and not when it comes to handling," says the European company's director in Spain, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of the procedure when the "fear of a novelty" has already been overcome.
However, if the client is married, but has not yet had children, it is better to have insurance against all risks, if that is allowed by his economic situation.
Families with children are considered insurance customers with the lowest risk index and therefore their premiums will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks with an insurance discount (which could amount to EUR 300) or at a high bonus, extended to other operators, starting with the third year after the purchase of the vehicle.
"Their management is calmer and their purchasing capacity is higher, so they can afford too much to get the highest discount," said Luis Noguera.
Pensioners are recommended to provide insurance against all risks with a discount of EUR 150 or extended to other operators if a high bonus has been achieved.
It should be said that car insurance is important not only because it protects drivers in the event of an accident, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is the reason why it is appropriate to study the possibilities of insurance that would most suit us in view of our personal situation.
Celtic is trying to get to AC Milan point, which means osmiffinal
AC Milan and Celtic will match their forces this Tuesday at the San Siro stadium in an effort to achieve a point they lack to achieve their respective goals in the "Champions" league, because for Italy it would be the first and in Scotland it would decide to place it.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured the process in the fifth remise match in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but needs another one to be sure that before him the Chess will not get six points, which will play with Benfick who has four.
These two games of Group D will be played a week before the end of the sixth round, as AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where the first stage of the 13th in the semifinal, in an attempt to enter the final, which is played by the sixteenth.
So this group will be closed before the other and indecisive result at Giuseppe Meazzy's stadium seems most likely, even though both men will try to win because the Italians will not want to hit the home and Celtic knows that after the win it would be the first and provide a better place in the osmiffinal.
The team of Gordon Scarhan could even get a loss if the Schachtór didn't win, but he couldn't rely on it because at the same number of nine points the Ukrainians who lost last week in Glasgow (2:1), but won in the first direct match (2:0).
And so the players of AC Milan will try to ruin the night for the Scotts who believe that the second time they will get to the semifinal in the reorganized Champions League just as they defeated them in the same match in the last competition with the goal of Kaka in the extension (1:0) after the status 0:0 in the base playing time.
Hopefully they'll win the "rosonery" will be the chess player who has the prize of winning only if Celtic wins, both for the osmiff's procedure and for the delay in UEFA.
Benfica, although she is the last and has no chance to continue in the highest European competition, could achieve a third place by one victory, so she would play in UEFA.
The first concert at the Spice Girls Tour took place in Vancouver 20 000
The Spice Girls group started in Vancouver, Canada, in front of 20,000 spectators their first tour since it split in 2000.
Posh Spice (Victoria Beckham), Scary Spice (Melanie Brown), Baby Spice (Emma Bunton), Sporty Spice (Melanie Chisholm) and Ginger Spice (Geri Halliwell) shortly before they started their concert at the GM Place Stadium in Vancouver, they said their group's reunion was "great".
Some 20,000 people bought tickets so they could be present at a concert that also included video depicting the history of this group, which led to the sensation at the end of the 1990s.
Return and World Tours are played at the same time as the new album released by EMI in Spain, which brings the selection of their main successful compositions, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five Spice Girls appeared on stage decorated bracelets given by their husband Posh Spice, British footballer David Beckham.
This sportsman was in a crowd that flooded GM Place, although the nervous Victoria banned him a few days ago.
Before the start of the show Victoria Beckham said about the British star that "he didn't see our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what he's thinking about the show."
"Sports Spice", whose departure from the group in 1998 "due to disagreements between us" caused the five-member group to dissolve two years later, also announced its nervousness in meeting with reporters two hours before the start of the show.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous, but I saw that the world's public opinion changed, the opinion of the Spice Girls changed.
And I was wondering why not, so I'm glad that I decided," Chisholm said about the re-union of the group she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that in time, "the things are settled and we all love each other very much".
However, many things have changed since Spice Girls last appeared together in 1998.
So at the beginning, according to CTV, the group flew to Vancouver by Virgin Airlines.
At the airport, an army of children was waiting for them.
Five has a total of 7 children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the group will take part in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5-7th).
He will be performing in Madrid on 23 December.
Concerns about the new dispute on gas between Russia and Ukraine
Russia and Ukraine are currently in dispute about the prices of natural gas, thereby increasing the risk that Russian fuel supply to Western Europe may be affected.
Most Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is run through a pipeline across Ukraine and any dispute between these two countries is closely monitored.
Kyev warned that if Moscow raises the price of gas, Russia will charge higher transit charges.
The previous dispute between these two last year has reduced deliveries to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kyiv and Moscow comes when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, are trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says that Ukraine will have to account for more because it has agreed to pay up to 50% more for the gas it receives from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it might mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its Gazprom supplies.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in the course of the negotiations," said Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoly Kinach, Reuters.
"The changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit charges (to Western Europe) across Ukraine."
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kyiv led to a reduction in deliveries from Gazpro to Ukraine in January 2006.
This caused a sharp fall in exports to Western Europe, which quickly increased prices.
Russian gas represents one quarter of deliveries to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas supplies in the world, but most of them remain underutilized.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS "must control foreign employees"
The Controller said that the Scottish Chambers of NHS must improve the control of criminal records for non-European employees.
The recommendation from the president of Robert Black's highest control office came after the foreign doctor acting in Scotland was linked to the June attacks at Glasgow Airport.
Mr Black also fears that the Scottish NHS does not have an accurate understanding of the amount of foreign personnel he employs.
But his report stressed that the other key controls were carried out in accordance with the pattern of five health authorities.
The President of the Supreme Control Authority was immediately interested in the June attacks on staff from outside the European Economic Area at Glasgow Airport.
Eighty-eight-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone hired Jeep to the door of the main terminal.
He was one of the three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court using a video bridge accused of connecting them to bombing attempts in Britain.
The NHS Chamber is expected to monitor foreign personnel in terms of qualifications, experience and work permit in Britain before their employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commissions use Discover Scotland for the control of criminal records, this agency has no power to obtain such information outside Britain.
The report of the President of the Supreme Control Authority, in addition to recommendations, states that the Commission should be guided by the guidelines of the Criminal Records Bureau, which assists employers with controls in several countries.
"Although we have found that part of the staff records contained evidence of these checks, they are not carried out regularly," the report said.
Mr Black said that the Scottish NHS in many cases is in line with its own pre-employment policy, but he added: "Our report points to areas where the system could be improved in order to ensure the availability of accurate information on the quantity of foreign personnel."
BMA President Dr. Peter Terry said it is "very unlikely" that pre-employment controls would identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report indicates that the current pre-employment controls in the Scottish NHS are working well and it is not clear what further value these comments will bring," he said.
The Scottish health authorities have announced that they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, most of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the President of the Supreme Control Authority pointed out that these numbers would probably also be higher because the Commission had to identify staff with a residence permit.
The investigation also found that the controls carried out by NHS authorities in the areas of Airshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian have been carried out to a large extent.
They included passport controls, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently revising the policy and pre-employment control directive for NHS foreign workers.
Minister of Health Nicola Sturgeon said, "I wanted to get this job straight after the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
She also added that the Scottish Government, in agreement with the Health Commissions, considered the recommendation of this report and ensure that the best practices were found in the updated pre-employment controls of all personnel, including those abroad, which it plans to issue next month.
Joy Division controls movie prices
Control, a biographical film about the deceased singer Joy Division Ianu Curtis, collected five prizes at the British Independent Film Awards, including prizes for the best movie.
The prizes were also won by the star Sam Riley, who worked to the role of Curtis in the warehouse, director Anton Corbín and in the later role of Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench was named the best actress for the thriller Scandal Records.
And the Star Bond Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for getting a British movie on the world stage.
The prizes were celebrated at the London Roundhouse.
Control describes Curtis's journey to glory with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black-and-white film - whose soundtrack contains The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - only stood 3 million pounds.
But he won the Dutch photographer Corbín, who was known before thanks to the iconic packaging of the U2 Joshua Tree album, two prices - for the best director and for the best debut director.
Rock music was the focus of another award - because Julien Temple's film about the singer Clash Joe Strummer won the award for the best document.
Viggo Mortensen won the Best Actor's Prick as a Russian Mafia boss driver in the London Thriller David Cronenberg Eastern Promise.
Ray Winston, who has a reputation as a tough man, won Richard Harris' award for the extraordinary benefit of the British film.
This 50th-century filmer, including Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is now filming other parts of Indiana Jones - the kingdom of crystal skulls.
Winston said he was proud of this prize, which is named after the star of the movies Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney opened the door for people like me," he added.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris several times.
He's my man, a great actor of my time, I'm very honored."
Independent film prices, known as Biffy, are awarded by a jury where filmmakers, actors and festival organizers meet.
Bif stands include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Sial and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrested 208 people for terrorist conspiracy
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants for membership in cells preparing for immediate attack on oil installations and also for spiritual and security components.
State television of the largest oil exporter reported that one of the cells wanted to use rockets in the country.
The supporters of al-Qaeda led a campaign against the monarchy, the United States, since 2003, i.e. from the invasion of Iraq.
The TV reported that a cell of eight militants led by a foreigner planned an attack on oil installations in the province of Ash-Sharqiyah.
Saudi Arabia is building a quick reaction unit with the strength of 35,000 members to defend the facility from the failed Al-Qaeda attack at the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiqu in 2006.
The report quoted the ministry's internal declaration: 18 arrested were part of a cell led by a "expert on missile firing", which went into the country.
She added that the militants were planning to take eight shots into the kingdom.
22 detainees were to prepare for the murder of spiritual and security workers.
The government urged the clergy to try to prevent the Saudis from leaving Iraq more to join al-Qaeda militants fighting the United Army and the Shiite government supported by the United States, which the conservative Sunnits of Saudis consider to be kaciari.
Al-Qaeda militants believe that the authorities have co-operated many religious in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that rules the government.
Militants - supported by the challenges of the leader al-Qaeda Saúda Usámy bin Ladina to focus on the Western Saudi government - focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This war has been a huge effort by security forces in the past... five months," state television said the interior ministry's spokesperson.
A 16-member "medial cell" in Medina was also arrested, which was aimed at promoting "taffiriian thought" - the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals, which promotes violence against Muslims marked as unbelievers and apostates.
Among those arrested were also 32 persons charged with providing financial support to militants.
The climate on Venus may be a view of the Earth's future
The scientists announced yesterday that Venus could have been a pleasant place to live.
Data from the current European station show that the planet is even more similar to the Earth's own twinkle than it used to be.
Venus is the nearest planetary neighbor to the Earth.
These two worlds are about the same size and run along similar treasures, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, conditions on Venus were similar to those on Earth and could have been habitable.
But the coolened greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion of solar radiation and lower speed of rotation sent Venus on a completely different course of development.
Today, the planet is waterless, the temperature on the surface is hot enough on the roof of the lead and it is released by storms and winds with the force of hurricane.
The findings of the European Space Agency Venus Express, which studied the planet for one year, provide a mid-term view of how the Earth could develop in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Oxford University Physics Department and one of the leading Venus Express missions said: "It is even clearer why the climate on Venus is so different than on Earth, although the planets themselves are quite similar.
"Our new data enables us to compile a script in which Venus began as well as the Earth, perhaps with the environment, billions of years ago."
Police have kept "rich uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched by uranium, was detained by the Slovenian and Hungarian police yesterday.
The police spokesperson said three people were detained and the material was examined.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but said that the substance could be sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
It's still hard.
Mitt Romney said that for presidential candidates it is not appropriate to answer questions from snowflakes.
Nevertheless, the Republican presidential candidates subsequently agreed to a debate on YouTube in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on video and transmitted them to the candidates sent.
None of the issues broadcast on Wednesday, November 28th, was as comical as a snowman who asked Democrats to global warming in the second party's debate on YouTube.
But the questions and answers this time reflected many of the Republican Party's position towards the elections next year.
It is not clear how exactly CNN producers, one of the sponsors of the debate, picked clips that were then shown to the aspiring candidates.
But the first half of the debate, the longest time devoted to the only issue, was focused on immigration.
This topic is one of the most powerful Republican topics.
CNN asked the panel of undecided voters to turn the wheel when they heard something comforting: the voter noted the peaks of agreement when the candidates spoke of a hard access at the borders.
The strongest and longest exchange of views occurred between Rudy Giuliani, the main candidate of the state, and Mr Romney, who stepped forward in key rapid votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to serve the reputation of a man who was as the prime minister of New York soft to illegal immigrants.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his home.
These two were particularly struck by the question of whether any of the candidates would support "amnesty" (to give illegal immigrants a normal position and the possibility of citizenship).
Later candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Congressman from Colorado, were able to put their little bit into the mill on this subject.
Neither one of them has a chance to nominate, but they're both still in the game because they're starting to be beaten for immigration earlier and stronger than the others.
At least the candidates have a similar view on immigration: greater severity on the borders, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, together with concerns about the poisoned toys from China and other concerns about the surrounding world, helps Republicans to forget or minimize the conflict between libertines and Christian conservatives.
But the debate began to be very unpleasant when it came to other issues.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he in the past supported the holding of firearms.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether the simulated heating technique should be considered torture.
One fortune - teller asked whether the candidates believed every word in the Bible.
Mr. Giuliani thus concluded that even though the Bible is his favorite book, he probably does not believe the story of Jonah and the giant.
Another leper asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now against all assumptions in the first place in a recent survey in Iowa due to his long-term Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, Jesus said that he was too smart to run for what he deserved to laugh at.
The fight remains unusually open.
The growth of Mr. Huckabee in Iowa is hiding with recent success in obtaining money and the voter joy of Ron Paul in the middle of the debate.
These two are from the bottom, because both sides are still unable to agree on more familiar and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates joined the party very soon and convincingly with a winning report on American size on lips, blurring on both sides.
This time, the party is torn apart and the result has a long way to go.
Labour Diseases
Gordon Brown again found a trap he could fall into; his journey remains the same.
Although it is customary for British political scandals, it is not particularly pizzard.
It doesn't seem like any rules would be sold, no accounts in the Paris hotel were paid in secret, no extramarital rings were paid.
But the barricaded Gordon Brown would hang out without it being discovered that a rich businessman after four years masked the contributions of the ruling Labour Party of $650,000 ($1.3 million) under the names of other people, and that the party did not report.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided the election and insulted British intelligence by claiming that this decision had not been affected by investigations, there was hope that it would ensure a sustainable and effective government.
Instead of formulating this as much as possible, the more funny Vice-President of the Liberal Democrats, Mr Brown once feared turned from Stalin to Mr Bean.
The unwarranted rescue of Northern Rock's problem bank showed weaknesses in the management and sound judgment under the fire.
Badly-thinking proposals to change the tax code have brought companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people revealed unimaginable administrative bias.
Three generals in retirement started rebellion in the House of Lords; they protested against the cuts in military expenditure because they claimed that being a commander of the armed forces was part-time work.
Now there are many gifts from David Abraham; Peter Watt, the secretary general of the Labourers (and their former guardian of internal disciplines), has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown would be heading in the wrong direction towards his end.
Even so, governments can reach the point of overlap that they are looking for.
People don't believe in politicians, and they don't like them, but most people react to their disbelief when we take over a new party.
If it seems clear that a prime minister is probably not improving anything, and doesn't have to be in the office for long, this is a removal: state administration becomes a mess, ministers start making briefings, the press is looking for bad news, and the government becomes unfocused and defensive.
In one way Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, because he cannot take the position of the new cost against other political leaders.
Anyway he'd like to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, problems with Northern Rock and the financial office records are linked to the decisions that Mr Brown made as Minister of Finance.
And even though he was not directly involved in blair's nightmares, such as long investigation into the financing of political parties caused by "values for money", voters can calmly decide that he was.
Still, Mr. Brown's hate isn't as bad as it looks.
Those seizures aren't as horrible as the conservatives do.
As for Mr. Bean, no one died or was exposed to deception.
And treatment, however painful it may be, is to provide what Mr Brown's Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, firm and easily brutal government.
The latest disparity around political gifts is a good example.
Mr. Garboid Abrahams, who compares his gifts to charity, says that he did not want any publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but the decision wasn't on him.
The laws against the anonymousity of great political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who could buy access to those who rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said that he knew about the procedure of Mr. Abraham, but did not know that he was illegal, would certainly be carefully questioned; likewise Jon Mendlesohn, the chief laborer of money who learned about the eight-year gifts in October.
But so far, Mr. Brown is not complicated; there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these plates, even though most of the payments were made until after his arrival in June.
The prime minister has done half the work.
He quickly condemned this violation of the laws by his own side, but he expressed his determination by making a statement after a certified instrument, a committee to investigate this matter - which was also led by the bishop in retirement and by the judge.
In this case, teaching is not complicated.
If the law was violated, it's about the police.
There are also other things that Mr Brown must do, such as finding an independent Standing Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has not been able to do for six months, and dealing with a real reform of the financing of political parties.
This would require labourers who are in a straitjacket to cooperate with the Conservatives and perhaps even give up their special financial relationship with the committees - bitter pills for a dedicated party, such as Mr Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
Conservatives now have a good lead in the research; he has two years to get the voters back; and the only way to win is an incomprehensible integrity and high competence.
Carrot sharks
Does the crisis affect US mortgages?
When blood is in the water, naturally they start to get excited about having a spinal cord.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is running low, the predators have focused on a darker credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts say that losses on credit cards could have reached $99 billion if more consumer loans had been imposed on subordinate mortgages.
The voltage marks are clear.
Increased number of inability to pay (for more than 30 days late payment) and depreciated accounts (accounts that the supplier considers to be inexhaustible).
Last month, HSBC announced that in the US consumer credit market, it lost $1.4 billion - also due to non-solvency loans on credit cards.
But he's in the panic yet.
There's still little to pay for the depreciated accounts and the inability to pay.
According to Moody's assessment agency, 3.89% of the insolvency rate in the third quarter was almost the full percentage point on average.
Worsening rates may be partly explained for technical reasons.
The 2005 amendment to the US Personal Bankruptcy Act led to a rapid decrease in the number of reported bankruptcys that make a large part of the losses on credit cards; the number of reporting (including the number of write-offs) would therefore rise regardless of whether the general conditions for borrowers have deteriorated.
The sector also shows a good payout rate that shows how much consumers pay monthly from their debts.
And the trust in the securities of secured credit cards is strong, even through paralysis in other points of structured finance.
Mr. Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup research company predicts that their emissions will be 25% higher than in 2007.
Direct paths for spreading infections between the crisis of subordinate mortgages and the credit card market definitely exist: when lending loans to real estate, consumers are more indebted to credit cards.
Credit card issuers, however, are more focused on cash flow than on the value of handicrafts, so falling home prices do not necessarily mean changing the confidentiality of borrowers.
They may even be useful to the lenders.
The motivation of consumers to pay mortgages is reduced when their property value falls below the value of the loan; as a result, the debt on the cards is moved up to the priority list to pay.
The card issuers can also respond more quickly and more flexibly to conditions more stormy than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid changes in the prices of handicrafts.
"It won't happen that we'd just re-evaluate all the loans one morning," says Gary Perlin, the financial manager of Capital One.
Although the risk of explosions in the form of lower mortgages is low, the risk of gradual weakening is far more real.
If lower home prices and debt reduction push America into recession, the credit card sector will face a darker future.
Watch out for those back-floor swims.
British bankers admitted guilt in Enron's case
Three British bankers who were to be tried for their role in the fraud associated with the former financial manager Enron Andrew Fastowe group have changed their statement and admitted guilt on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were initially guilty of seven fraud charges, when they, together with Fastow, were involved in financial fraud in 2000 -- enriching themselves on behalf of their employees -- they argued.
They were supposed to be in January before the court.
However, during the trial before U.S. interim judge Ewing Werlin Jr., everyone admitted to one fraud.
The case of these three former CEOs of Greenwich NatWest, the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, appeared on the front pages for the entire two years that lasted the issue.
In the United States, their case is one of the unclosed parts of the investigation initiated after Enron’s collapse in 2001.
The indictment brought against them in 2002 pointed out to Mr Fastow that he was the aim of the government investigation into Enron's collapse.
The lawsuit against bankers -- who earned the nickname "NatWest's Three" -- claims that in 2000 they came to Houston to forge a fraud together with Fastow and his former CEO Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in Enron's partnership branch controlled by Fastowe, who was the architect of many enronous frauds that looked at Enron after the spiral towards bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank assessed its share of this branch zero, but our three British people knew that it really had significant value.
The company under Kopper's control bought the bank's share in this branch for $1 million.
Incriminate bankers paid Kopper a share of $250,000 in this company.
According to Fastow's complaint, Enron fraudulently informed that the energy company would pay 20 million dollars for its share in this branch of Greenwich NatWest.
However, those 20 million actually went to those British bankers, Fastov and others.
The bankers were charged with 7.3 million and Fastow, Kopper, and the others improved by about 12.3 million dollars.
In January 2004, Fastow admitted his guilt in two cases of conspiracy for his role in overthrowing Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in the federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a sentence of three years and one month in a facility in Texarkana.
All three of the British were on their way to bail out $1 million, which they were ordered to stay in the United States for the upcoming trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the country, fell into bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting fraud could no longer hide billions of debts or show failing speculation as profits.
The collapse has destroyed thousands of jobs, more than $6 billion in market value and more than $2 billion in pension insurance.
The founder of Enron Kenneth Lay and former chief employee Jeffrey Schilling were convicted last year for their role in the collapse of the company.
Skilling is in effect more than twenty-four years of punishment.
Judgments over Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were deleted after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow's incapacity
The price of the G550 Golfstream, equipped with Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient fuel volume for non-stop flights from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of the Russian rich, however, it is small to be returned.
"He can carry up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of them care so much about places because it's for a close family or a corporate president."
Mr. Firer was sitting at the Gulfstream station last Friday at the Millionary Exhibition, which is a four-day orgy of displayed consumption in the mammary exhibition centre on the outskirts of the capital city.
Apart from Gulfstream, it has built over 200 other luxury suppliers who hoped that the freshly rich Russians would push on everything from the mahogany-exposed yachts to diamonds decorated with car trimmings that wouldn't even be ashamed of 50 cents.
Mr. Firer carefully looked at the clear orange Porsche in the next stop.
"It's a nice car, but it's five and ten against us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
On the waves of the oil, money is spent in the Russian capital just as it was when Dallas had its days.
"We went through the same stage in the 1980s when some Americans greatly enriched and moved to Europe, where they looked at them as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year listener at the Davis Center for Russian and Euro-Asian Studies at Harvard.
Like the Saudi broadcasters from the 1970s and Japan in the 1990s, the Russians become the most prominent losers in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their work on this Klondike.
Another place in Moscow this week attracted the conference of the luxury industry Donatell Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of the LVMH Group, to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods on markets such as Russian.
(The Conference is organised by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
Russia has a list of the richest people in Forbes 53 billion with a total of $282 billion.
In addition, the local main institute of the Center for Economic and Financial Research issued a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which in Russia there are 103 000 "secondary" millionaires, whose assets amount to $670 billion.
(The World Bank states that in 2005 15.8% of Russians lived below the existing minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millions in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of the London Clergy David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, along with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are perfectly adjusted and men are everyone for all their property."
When they passed in the evening dress on Sunday night halls, 11-year-old Evgenia Yumatov and five-year-old Svetlana Turovov themselves and their clients named themselves millionaires.
"I've been looking at these cars and I can't decide between Infinity, Mercedes and Porsche," said Miss Yumatov, who was dressed as a veteran of red blankets, with whom Joan Rivers looks like a home road.
The fair seemed to focus mainly on fresh rich people, brand-run Russian buyers who are willing to sit down for a few hours in road traffic so that they can walk through the warehouses that cry out Cadillacy Escalade, platinum fish, ice cream Mövenpick, ballboards in peace, apartments in Dubai, gunpowder and wig.
Members of the public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in what brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the Dutch porcelain producer Royal Delft before the reproduction of Rembrandt's image from hand painted blue tiles in a living size.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in gold."
And in fact, the salesmen here say that the Russians are with old money (according to Russian measurements 10 to 15 years old) have moved from bright logs to little known limited editions that would never appear on the shop.
Even a few thousand people, whether they're millionaires, millionaires' envoys or simple tourists, the day the fair halls flooded.
And some of them bought.
On the first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ersov, the local general manager of King Koil's bed, said that he sold two mattresses of silk, cashmere and cotton, covered with gold nets, for $70,000.
Also on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, the sales manager of A1 Moto, who features high-end cars with high-end alarms, said that his company sold clearly orange Porsche for $170,000 to the Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, announced that he was willing to adjust the luxury car that he sold three slots to cars in the style of combined chain straps for Rolls-Royce Phantoms for $55,000.
He showed the reporter a car wheel designed for the Russian casino owner, who had a pulled-out Swarovski crystal so it looked like a roulette.
Price: $22,000 for four of these.
"That Russian millionaire who wants a wheel of leather or a portrait of his wife from a circular zirconia, doesn't have to ride on those wheels yet," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He'll put them in his garage from thirty to forty cars."
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaire" does not mean anything very exclusive at the present time, given the large increase in the prices of this property.
"If you bought your apartment three or four years ago in Moscow, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, when it's not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at the stand of the Russian company Alliance Continental, which deals with asset management.
The company used four red British-style phone booths to pick up the columns of counterfeit banks worth millions of dollars.
Azad Karryev, the marketing manager of the company, said his team had printed 500,000 fake banknotes for the Millionaires Fair.
They stopped around to throw money around, or let their friends take a picture of their cell phone, as they rest in the middle of a surrogate fortune, or simply cut out a few million pockets.
"You know, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," Mr. Karryev said.
Death in New Jersey may be caused by a damaged operation
It was the day before the Thanksgiving celebration when Roland Livingston looked out of the big windows of the restaurant right here about something healthier and watched a sanitizer that came to a white New England house with two houses below West Scott Avenue.
The car was soon connected to the police station.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the delivery of the judge," said Mr. Livingston, a restaurant controller.
"At that moment, I knew someone had died."
The authorities found out that a dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41 years old, executive assistant director of the Nigerian police department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether she died because of the procedure carried out by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity was refused by the police, who worked at the house number 212 on West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet found out what caused Miss Arroy's death, and they hope that toxicology tests, whose results do not have to be known for weeks, will help resolve the mysterious death caused by the management of the Nigerian police.
Ms. Arroy was assistant police director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and hard working," said Mr. McCarthy about Miss Arroy in a phone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
She'd protect me."
Mr. McCarthy said that Miss Arroy was Jimmy Arroyo's wife, a former Nigerian police officer working for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she left two sons behind at age 14 and 11 and her own daughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesperson for the Union, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detective is trying to find out if Miss Arroy died as a result of an unlicensed surgery.
"It's one of the options," said Miss Walsh.
"The investigation is still going on."
The authorities indicated that they arrived at the house at about three o'clock in the afternoon.
In November, they found Miss Arroya on the couch.
She was declared dead at the scene.
More than a week later, the authorities still said little about their investigation or the owner of the house, allegedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Miss Walsh didn't say if the authorities heard from Miss Castro.
The investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house has been used as an office.
No one answered in the middle of Miss Castro's house, with a destroyed pink fence in the front garden and a Dalmatian leaping behind.
Next to the door that led to the shop, he crowned in the open garage a blue barrel with the inscription "Ethyl Vanillin" - a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
There were two mountain bikes hanging on wheels on one side.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived 25 years later in the New York Police Department in New York City, Miss Arroy provided him with invaluable help in tasting the unbearable and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'You should take care of this or this,' she said.
"She was always here when I came, and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
Hope that the Fed reduces interest rates leads to a stronger global stock exchange
The stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after the market hopes that the Federal Bank will try to calm the borrowing conditions by further reducing interest rates, were reinforced by the reassuring forecasts of the Vice-President of the U.S. Central Bank.
The storms jumped in London, New York, and across Europe after Donald Kohn, the second in line with Ben Bernanke, President Fed, said that in response to continued pressure on financial markets, there must be "flexible and pragmatic" drivers.
As part of a clear effort to calm down emerging markets in the midst of the signs of a revitalizing credit wave, Mr. Kohn said that the recent challenges "have partially returned some improvements in the functioning of markets towards the end of September and October".
He further stated that if increased instability persists, the possibility of financial conditions for households and companies further deteriorates.
Investors consider these projections to be a signal that the Fed is ready to add to the US market additional fresh capital doses and possibly further reduction in interest rates to stabilise credit conditions.
These comments also helped to calm Wall Street down in the midst of other bad reports about the American economy when the sale of apartments in October showed record low numbers.
The results of the financial confidence were supported by the investment bank Bear Stearns' announcement that it will abolish 650 jobs, which are 4% of its world labour force, in the context of a reduction in costs due to the compensation of the serious losses caused by the unfavourable interest in the provision of subordinated loans to housing in America.
Only 20 of these places are expected to be destroyed in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial index grew by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, and it closed at 13,289.40, while the more used S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 per cent, and closed at 6,306.2, with the value of British blue chips increased by more than 39 billion pounds.
The German Dax index grew by 2.6 per cent and the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 per cent.
Some time ago, credit tensions on the markets were shown in full force after these funds were lent to the European commercial banks at a rate of 4,7 %, which is the most since April 2001.
The pressure on the British Bank to follow the Fed and the ECB and release over-standard money on the London money markets increased by the rise in the three-month UK interbank loan rates "Libor" after continuous growth from November 12th to its peak from the end of September - 6.59 per cent.
England has to decide: Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas here, one almost as hard as the other.
Who's gonna be the number six on the finger for England this weekend in Kanda, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context of nothing less relevant than the first anti-Sri Lance test, who is going to make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, President of the Election Commission, who holds the best position at this position at the time of the loan, has Peter Moores, Chief Coach, and Michael Vaughan, Captain, with decision-making assistance, and because Hugh Morris, the Chief Manager of the English team, is beginning to apply to the National Elections Officer, not necessarily to the full.
Anyone who doesn't stand in the sixth place on his thumb will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sport is not at all.
It is not easy to find what one gets at the top of his profession, while another will never get through a lower level, sometimes because of a lack of happiness rather than ability.
Not only in cricket is the choice difficult and requires a judgment that must ultimately be subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to move up?
It's fair to Shah, if it is?
In the same way, we could ask ourselves in other areas, let's say that here are John Edwards or "Tube" Bannerjee, both smart young executives with good education and review in the field, should be promoted to the commission - the place is for one.
Who's to say what level is right for the cricketer if he doesn't get a chance to fall or swim on the next?
Of course, decision numbers have a major impact, but they have opportunities.
In the team, a cricketer must capture the captain's view at the right time if he is to take a wicket, and the sticker needs a regular chance at the starting positions, if he is ever to make a impression as a one-day cricketer.
Capture the selection view is more complicated.
For example, last year’s season was much better than James Anderson, whose place in the first test seemed to be certain, even though Stephen Harmison had declared himself healthy and promoted himself as a fireman.
Anderson took 32 first-class tickets at 33 crossings for everyone.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same extreme average, but both had their moments at the highest level and hoped for further.
If he's playing at the Asgiiya Shah Stadium, or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can lead to a career both, or it doesn't have to have a big influence either.
Four years ago at Sri Lance Gareth Batty played in each Test and in the first class gave good performances, five wikis and 40 vacations, but it was Paul Collingwood, who at the same time fought for his place, who finally became a stable Cricketer of Test, who is moreover, although in Australia against Australia he scored two hundred points, perhaps still underrated.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another discussion about today's training purely at Asirgiy Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and give Shaw more experience in front of Bopar's youth resilience.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, he speaks of his ambitious and valuable debut test shifts at 88 points in Bombay and 32 percent in the first class against six Boparov, who is, at twenty-seven years of age, under the age of seven and has excellent spin-over statistics.
However, Shah did in two shifts in May against the Caribbean in the Lord's Test, his home field in Middlesex, only ten runs, and that, along with the immediate refusal of the voters, when Vaughan wanted to put him back on the next match, his firing seemed to be wearing something out of an elvan that was so obvious in Bombay.
By contrast, the Essex universe has joie de viverre in bones.
Nothing pulls him out of the cricket court and his behavior outside the court symbolises a recently converted car with a four-wheel drive on the exhibition day of the English team’s car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He took out with slight injuries and a slight shock, but as the first thing he pulled out his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his partner, who was watching it up and asking him excitedly, "Did you see it?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, its medium-speed swings on the right flanks, which seem to him to be suitable, delivering effectively and firing with self-aware and handy.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe it's the real art of choice.
I personally swear to Bopara get his chance now, but I don't want to say that Shah won't excel if, as the Ceylon tea tickets indicate, he'll be the one who's playing next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and in the fight against al-Qaeda
The first buses filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday and evicted refugees who had been paid or lost their visas, and others who hoped that the city would return to normal life.
Some even returned to fight the armed men who drove them out of their homes.
The Mansur bus station was before 800 people from Damascus arrived in the official government convoy on a dozen buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned to private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Kubaji, Sunni doctor.
"I came back today for what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, what was happening in Baghdad and how it's safe now.
"They say that Mahdi's army has stopped killing people," he said, means a Shiite militia of the militant spiritual Muktada al-Sadra, who temporarily ordered his people to stop fighting.
Kasim al-Atwani, an 18-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni territory of Amaría, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime did not allow the Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amaría called him by the fact that the local defense with the support of the American army helped to push Al-Qaeda out of her positions in the west of the capital, and ordered him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of the Sunni and Shiite tribe, which from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad has avoided a grenade attack after forcing his fellow citizens to rebel against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"A few friends called me yesterday and told me that they were riding in Sleikh militia against al-Qaeda and that they needed me and my boys' support.
That's why I came back today," said 20-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many spoke of the attractiveness of peace in the capital after the strengthening of the American military presence and the growth of local "group of interested citizens", which were armed on the side of the American army to defend their neighborhood.
But more has been said about the obstacles around visas and the loss of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a 14-year-old father of three children, voiced a suspicion shared among the refugees that Núri al-Maliki, a Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on the visa of refugees and had them returned.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people fled from Iraqi sectarian killings.
"It was all right before al-Maliki visited Syria and pressed on the government to stop giving the Iraqis a visa to have to return to Iraq," the Sunni pensioner said.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned me down after I left home."
Part of the reason for the weakening of violence is the fact that the Sunni were pushed out of Shiite areas and on the contrary, which in many places reduces tension.
There are fears that the sudden influx of refugees will rekindle the sectarian tension and lead to another battle.
Little sarcasm, good education
The smallest community country in Germany plays a leading role in professional education, even excels the international focus of its high schools.
Only in one educational area does Sarsko worry about the same deficiency as the rest of Germany.
"A man who does not come from Syria, I explained yesterday after 50 years that we are not French" - this self-inflicted password appears on posters on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the birth of this small community country.
France and Luxembourg, however, play a major role in the Sardis education system, which is in monitoring the education of the Colin Institute for Economic Research (IW) in fifth place.
High schools have traditionally cooperated closely with the surrounding countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 in France.
To this day, students can finish their studies with a double or even triple degree.
This corresponds to a relatively high share of foreign students, which accounts for 15.6 %.
Because the average number of children in Sardis is to be admitted to high school - many of them even without a study in high school.
"A specialist education system is being used in Iraq," says Axel Plünnecke, an educational expert in IW.
The fact that more than every fifth young person receives a licence to study at a vocational school is more than 7% higher than the German average.
Compared with the rest of Germany, there are rich opportunities in Syria to combine practical and academic education.
The opportunities to study two fields are given the number of the second best inhabitants throughout Germany.
Through practically oriented education and rising demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by one third in recent years.
So the Sardis Ministry of Education now ordered high schools to set up a promotional campaign in engineering.
"After our first study of the Scriptures in general education schools, we made a few reforms," says the spokesperson of the Ministry of Education.
The government has therefore conducted comparative tests throughout Germany.
To start learning as soon as possible, the last year of the mother school is free of charge - a model that takes over other school countries.
If the results of the students are significantly improved, they will show up to the next comparative study.
In 2003, the proportion of risk disciples decreased from 29% to 20%.
In general, however, Sarska has not improved as much as other rural countries.
The Bavarians can count better.
And to the disappointment of the Sarca study Pisa does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise, Sarska could be a point in this area.
The language of the neighbours is mandatory in the gymnasiums - even though the citizens of Sarca are not French.
Chavez moves for hours
What they don't see is going to be hours in Venezuela other than the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez will be allowed to move the hours back in this South American country half an hour.
In Spain, in the meantime, Chavez becomes a funny figure.
Venezuela's official newspaper reported that the hours under the new law against world times shift by minus four and a half hours.
The South American state will be this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
Chavez, the enemy of the United States, has justified his decision, among other things, by using the United States to distribute time bands throughout the world.
In the middle of the local time, Chávez also announced that he was interrupting relations with neighboring Colombia because of the case with the hostages.
This leftist nationalist said that while conservative Alvaro Uribe is President of Colombia, he will not have any relations with him or with the Colombian government.
"For my own self-esteem, I can't," said Chávez, who promotes the reform of the constitution that citizens of this oil country have to vote on in Sunday's referendum.
This reform would strengthen Chávez's power in the country.
The cadet called for Uribe's decision to withdraw Chavez's mandate to negotiate in Colombia with Marxist rebels to release the hostages.
By his decision, Uribe "swift into the face", Venezuela criticised Uribe Chávez on Sunday.
And everyone in Spain is talking about Chavez.
The new mobile call here sparked a stir: "Why don't the callas" (Why don't you shut up?) - that's what a sentence that's already got more than half a million people off the Internet.
The Spanish King Juan Carlos spoke of her, whom, at the recent Ibero-American summit, the remarks of this leftist populist were so disillusioned that he silenced her in this way.
Germans are threatened with lower payouts in 2007
According to the forecast, this year German employees are threatened with reducing real wages even in the face of a strong crisis.
Experts have justified their pessimistic prediction for a number of reasons.
According to the estimates of the Hans Böckler Foundation, in 2007 employees can actually calculate that they will receive lower wages than in last year.
"Wine is a small increase in wages, an increase in value added tax and an increase in food and energy prices," said Bild Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomy und Konjunkturforschung.
New burdens on employees may also be expected in the area of unemployment insurance.
The Minister for Finance Peer Steinbrück told Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that the planned reduction of unemployment contributions to 3.3% in the new year is correct and reasonable in this situation.
However, the social labour agency should no longer fall into such difficulties as to require loans or contributions from young people, quoted the newspaper of this socially democratic policy.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the price explosion of food and oil products has prevented inflation in its highest state in the last 13 years.
In the annual price comparison, the total price rose by three percent.
Venus is a hellish twin of the Earth
Throughout his life, the enemy atmosphere of Venus Earth is more similar than ever. The Venus Express European Space Survey on Venus has recorded phenomena that occur in winter on Earth: lightning in the atmosphere and wind belief in the fields.
For almost three decades now, scientists have believed that Venus is nearing.
Now the Venus Express European probe has brought proof - caught electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, lightning flies from the dark to the darkness at a height of about 56 kilometers, written in the scientific magazine Nature Christopher Russell from the University of California in Los Angeles.
According to a well-known theory, the origin of the original substance could have originated life on Earth by lightning. The storms allegedly caused in the oceans reactions that led to the formation of amino acids, the basic stones of life.
There was no such thing as, "If there was ever life there, it must have been a long time ago," explains Sean Solomon of Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today, there is hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus. The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth and sometimes temperatures here are about 500 °C.
"Venus is perhaps a hellish twin of the Earth, but it is a twin," said Russell.
Why Venus, which is so much like Earth and size, began to develop completely differently is the basic question of Esa’s mission.
As no probe has been sent since the beginning of the 1990s for the sole purpose of the Venus study, the start of the Venus Express survey in November 2005 was in the research of this planet as a miller.
According to scientists, the latest results of research, which approached several articles in the journal Nature, did not emphasize the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They also showed that our neighboring planet is more like Earth than expected," said Esa.
In addition to the already known winds of the North Pole, scientists have found a dark belief in the South Pole, which is much faster.
This phenomenon recalls air currents on the earth’s northern shelf, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Astrophysica Spasciale e Physics Cosmica.
The second most internal planet of our solar system is made up of almost the same mass as Earth and, on average, 12100 km is almost the same size.
This planet named Jitřenka or Večernice will round the Sun in no time for 225 days.
However, it turns around its own axis much slower. One day on Venus lasts 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus does not recall the surface temperature of 460 °C and the pressure of 92 bar earth, scientists believe that both planets have been created under very similar conditions.
The water was gathered on both sides, but on earth it remained in the oceans, while from Venus it disappeared into the universe.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound in carbonates, on Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends the meeting of Merkel with the Dalailam
Col President Köhler demands the end of the party disputes for the adoption of the Dalailam in the Office.
He criticised the SPD directly for her attacks on the office after the September meeting.
Colonel Horst Köhler is concerned about the reputation of Germany and is calling for a great coalition to end the struggle around the adoption of the Dalailam.
"We should not present ourselves as a nation that is not united on this issue," Köhler told the commercial newspaper Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed his understanding of the decision by the German Chancellor Angely Merkel (CDU) to adopt the Dalailam in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, they have universal human rights for me," Köhler said.
The President-in-Office stressed, however, that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, but this did not prevent Merkel from stopping when it was calculated that it was creating a new policy towards China.
"The mayor did not abandon China's traditional policy.
China knows that too," Köhler said.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) made an indirect announcement of his disagreement with the adoption of the Dalailam, and was attacked by a number of coalitions.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the "prevative" foreign policy of the coalition.
After the adoption of the Dalailam in the Office, German-Chinese relations deteriorated.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD) but, according to SPIEGEL, the so-called strategic dialogue of foreign ministries also frozen both countries.
The Chinese Prime Minister of the Wen Jiabao government called Chancellor Angel Merkel to admit that the adoption of the Dalailam was a mistake.
China does not approve when European politicians officially accept the Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed China's position.
The words and deeds of the Dalailam have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan areas that are also located in the territory of China, tries to separate from China.
Schäuble warns against similar disturbances that have erupted in France
Street fights with police, gunshots, fire cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns against similar riots that broke out in France.
We must do everything we can to ensure that social unhappiness in Germany does not increase in street violence, the social minister calls for.
The barricades were burning, the raiders were shooting at the police. After serious youth troubles in France, the social minister inside Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
"We must be careful not to cause such social tensions as to break down in violence.
We have to take this seriously," Neue Press said in the Havana newspaper.
Not every young person can cope with a rapid change in social reality.
The government, the country and the village are already working hard to remove problems, Schäuble said.
Which means not just integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit after the Islamic Conference, we note the first successes."
However, caution is still in place.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of German suburbs are not comparable to those of French cities.
Last night, young people were fighting hard street fights with the police in the northern suburbs of Paris.
Even in Toulouse, cars and public buildings were burned.
The larger integration efforts of the German government demanded from the President of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
For the sake of peace in France, Kolat warned against "like effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
However, it should be done.
Colat pointed out that among people under 25 who come from migrant families, the unemployment rate is "on average high".
Above all, there is a need to ensure a greater number of study opportunities.
The Colat stressed, "We must give young people hope."
The President of the Turkish village, however, added that in Germany, unlike France, there is greater social control of families.
Moreover, many young people in migrant families do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
"But we have to be careful."
We have to let young people "be quick to start working and getting educated."
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel remained mostly quiet.
There were hundreds of policemen in the ambush, and over the area, a helicopter flew over with lightning.
The authorized authorities reported three arrests and several burned waste bins and cars.
Since yesterday, about 1,000 forces have been deployed.
The police will intervene as long as it takes, notifying Michelle Alliot-Marie after visiting the suburban minister inside.
In the suburbs of Villiers-le-Bel, about 80 policemen were injured on Tuesday night.
The following night, Toulouse's troubles took hold.
The accident caused a Sunday traffic accident, in which two young people died.
According to the initial findings of the state representation, the police are not guilty of the death of young people.
In the reign of Angely "The Clouds"
The chancellor's really remote exit shows that the coalitions are programmed at the end and that we can't expect anything from it anymore.
What country does this clerk actually live in?
After her uneasy, blasphemous and poor speech on the General debate of the General Assembly, we must note: not here - not in this country, which she should finally manage.
On the assumption that he was focusing too much on foreign policy, Angela Merkel answered one very arrogant sentence.
That's provincial, she said, what she showed she didn't want to understand what the critics were talking about.
In Col's film, she's clearly shown how much she deserves the print.
He was not really interested in Merkel, but he felt about the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela presented herself as "The Clouds": a policy that stands out above others that runs into foreign policy, and even there is only a noise.
For example, climate protection: the summit in Heiligendam is constantly being praised for its conclusions, but it does not say how the climate goals are to be achieved in Germany.
And anyway, such self-reproach -- so much modesty would have forgiven the CDU president two years ago.
Now it's limited to the planned phrases that could increase its profile among people.
This approach damages its image of pragmatics, which does not need to be corrupted because it solves problems.
But in Angela's realm, "The Clouds" are internal political problems of marginality.
Child poverty and people's concerns with low pay?
She's got a few extra sentences left on these topics.
It is worth noting how often the Merkels, when it comes to children's supplements, renegotiates.
Three times Merkel has to start from the beginning to be able to express at least a partially correct sentence.
As soon as things start to be very concrete, it's going to hit like in a completely foreign field.
Department of Attack
The debate of the Republican presidential candidates on Youtube in the case of Rudy Giulianicho and Mitt Romney's favorites has spread into a heated debate - both now have to fear the outside candidate.
The tension of both candidates is already on the first topic.
Mitt Romney is anticipating his opponent Rudy Guilianim that he made New York a "place of refuge for illegal immigrants".
Giuliani quickly reacts with strong impressions: "I think that his own house was just one such shelter," he responds and predicts to former Governor Massachusetts that he was personally employing immigrants without documents.
Since the Republican base has no clear preference so far, eight presidential candidates are using this debate on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
A half-minute, internet user-recorded video sent through Youtube only serves as such a key topic tip.
"This is exactly the policy of isolationism that we have allowed Hitler to grasp," John McCain told his opponent Ron Paul, who as the only one is promoting the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
The Vietnamese vet McCain doesn't examine his prints or Romney because he refuses to condemn the torture method of the survey called "Waterboarding", in which the heat is simulated.
The reaction of the public in St. Petersburg, Florida, shows that there is neither war in Iraq nor torture among the important topics of the campaign.
The pledge will be put to a standstill whenever conservative values are adopted and future tax increases are rejected.
Then it will show where the weaknesses of both favorites lie.
"I was wrong this time," explains Romney, and asks for a page base and a television audience to forgive him for having been a standstill for executions in 1994.
Giuliani is distraught when she is asked to explain the Bible literally.
Musharaf First Government in Civil
On the day following his resignation from the position of chief army commander, the Pakistani ruler Musharaf made a presidential oath.
That's the end of eight years of military government in Pakistan.
The President of Pakistan, Parvíz Musharaf, took a presidential oath on Thursday, and will be in the presidential office for another five years.
Pakistani television broadcast a live ceremony that took place in the presidential palace in the capital of Islamabad.
Musharaf swore he would respect the constitution and strive for the good nation.
On Wednesday, his office of chief army commander handed over to his commissioner Ashfaq Kiyanim, who was subjected to international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after the inexorable military coup took power, the former General will rule for the first time as a civilian head of state.
By retreating from the position of chief commander of the armed forces, Musharaf met one of the main requirements of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the abolition of the exceptional state that Musharaf declared on 3 November.
According to High Representative Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharaf will abolish the exceptional status soon after his oath, and will meet further Western requirements.
The Supreme Court of the country, which, following the declaration of exceptional status at the beginning of November, had been occupied by its lawmakers, rejected all objections last week concerning the contested re-election of the head of state on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four others injured during the attack on the military convoy in the tribal area of North Waziristan.
Speaking armies have indicated that the bomb exploded on the road near the Afghanistan border.
Father's crouch is coming back
The famous German group of the 1970s is playing again. Three members of the harmonia group recaptured their electronic synthesizers at the Berlin concert.
Revival will include Live 1974, the sister of the most successful band.
They were much more familiar abroad this time.
The announced sensation then lies in the performance of three gentlemen who at first seem to enjoy dinner.
Everyone's got a box, cables, and mostly buttons.
Thirty-three-year-old Dieter Moebius in a snow-white shirt sits in the middle.
After his left is seventy-seven-year-old Michael Rother, who has a laptop and a guitar in front of him.
Thirty-seven-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who is focused on synthesizers, is from the right side of the audience.
Everyone contributes to the sound, sometimes even beats.
Some of them, of course, will produce a traditional composition.
It doesn't seem too much to the musicians.
Among the lovers of the Krautrock, the Revival of the Chapels of Harmony sparked considerable excitement.
One thing here is worth noting. Repeated questions have shown that this name is part of the collective awareness of the pope, but it is certainly not so running as to cause the band to suffer pain for twenty-three years.
But why wouldn't even Germany celebrate its still living legends from the 1970s?
And especially when you're in musical style, the wrong-named Krautrock, in England and in America, she appreciates more than in her own country.
When in 2003 the musical business gave the remaining members of the Can Colin Group an Echo price for life work, the hall was filled with anxious views of German pop fans.
In addition, when Red Hot Chile Peppers thanked the La Düsseldorf and Neu groups for their performance, the wildebeest no longer knew the border.
Michael Rother later at the Red Hot Chile Peppers concerts sat with them on stage as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and worshiping abroad is one thing.
By recalling the hat of Harmony, we exaggerated memory, this trio existed for only two years, and even at that time there was no such effect as others later attributed to them.
Moebius and Roedelius were already playing with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promised name Cluster.
At first they played at the Berlin Schaubühne Theatre.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons at the church-run Gramophone company.
Rother briefly helped with the Kraftwerk group, but he won as a guitarist at the Neu band!, which was perhaps the most radical German group at the time.
In 1973, Rother followed band musicians to exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in Old Weserhof, the ruins of the 16th century, lived as members of the municipalities who fled the city.
They didn't live here as ideologically as in Commune I, where Roedelius could still walk as a child.
It was rather a life in such a spitzweg art creature.
The name of the art concerned is allegedly derived from the name of the Song of Harmony Ottenstein, whose name appears to be in the ashes.
A lot of that harmony kept.
The first album was called "The Music of Harmony" and the next "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, she suffered from financial difficulties.
The gathering of the weeds was not just about self-recognition.
Now the "Live 1974" CD was cut off at a concert in Griessem in front of a record-cut little, barely fifty-inch show.
Rothera once expressed her wish that the members of the Harmonie would be executed and practised on occasion.
For Roedlia and Moebia, it was a completely wrong request.
In 1975 the band announced its divorce.
Rother ended up in the esoteric sphere and secured his future with the album "Burning Heart".
The Cluster chapel has been alive again in the 1980s, and since then it's been more successful than Harmony ever was.
We can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer for the live album from Griessemer.
His recording company Greenland took the goal of watching the Krautrock as the original German contribution to live music.
Chapel Neu! at the time, Roedeli's solo work was considered.
The resurrection of the body of Harmony will take place in the Berlin House of World Culture.
The performance at the Woldtronics Festival will be publicly sponsored.
There will be Brit, Julian Cope, an old pancake and author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
The founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte, is also participating.
That's what we planned for the overall spread of the krautrock to the future pop music.
The empty place of the famous group will be filled with harmony.
Brian Ena's aunt, accompanied by the most beautiful sounds in the hall, boasts: "The only true music belongs to her future."
There are images on which the producer with Harmony is in the agricultural sitting.
The creation of the legend also contributes to the promising of other black and white photographs, on which are combined the instruments of the wildebeest connected cables.
Previously, these three veterans were again employed by improvisation.
Not by glueing microphones to wires and drums to get those never-heard self-made tones out of the tools.
Today electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three to the point-to-point technique.
Nothing changes the House of World Culture.
Under the guidance of Barbara Morgenster, under the sound of the dark whispers and in one beautiful place, she sings emphatically "Aaaaaaaaaaa!"
Krautrock was always a very English concept.
It's never been rock.
We would rather find the roots than in blues at music schools (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in escape from artistic and social conventions (cluster).
He who cries out "'68!" in this place is not so far from the truth, but Harmony will not be allowed to go out of peace.
Even the most obvious thing on the stage is to think carefully.
Where does music start and when does it end?
This question is whether a person will be prepared for the nerves or will be willing to live through the miserable moments of happiness.
Richard Gere's just not cynical enough.
With the introduction of the films The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden, two films about the war in the Balkans appeared.
But none of them are convinced.
The motion pictures either put too much emphasis on accompaniment and shooting, or they're too sensitive.
That doesn't stop an actor like Richard Gere at The Hunting Party.
Good news as first: War criminals Karadz and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but right there, in the dark background of the Bosnian War, the actor Richard Gere will fall.
In recent times, we have lost sight of this most beautiful man in the 1980s, not only because he played a lot of favorite, minor role in the cool women's films, but in conjunction with his press conferences forever on the subject of Buddhism, people will take a taste for another movie with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the most powerful argument for watching The Hunting Party - Where does the hunter become useful (Why do movie names have to be so long and wrapped up today?).
Gere gives a magical performance. His war reporter Simon Hunt is basically the one who could happen to Gere if fate and the film industries were not so merciful: a man who has his best years long ago, but as a concerned memory like himself still retains a certain remarkable feature.
But despite this drum, The Hunting Party is together with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which also enters the cinema this week, just to continue an endless series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
With the film Mörderischer Frieden we can do a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who saves a Serbian girl from a Kosovo shooter, and one of them falls in love with her.
Although it is commendable that the Serbs are not represented here as the cause of all evil, this television film changes too soon in shooting and action.
There'll be something very similar to the Kobra 11 series without the highway, but for that war.
On the film The Hunting Party, you can see clearly why the Balkan War has not been able to film a really good movie so far.
The story of three U.S. war reporters, who are known as the "man", the Serbian top war criminal, could become a new "Apocalypse" at another time and under the direction of another director and scriptwriter (there both Richard Shepard).
Both stories look like a surprise: small groups go into the woods to do something that the army is not able to do, but their journey becomes a path to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of the movie The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not one of the glamorous and sentimental cynics presented at the beginning.
On the contrary, the proposal also prescribes a romantic affair with a later Bosnian Muslim murdered.
Film The Hunting Party can be finally written after reporters in the last five accelerated minutes of the film have failed what has happened to NATO, the CIA and all the world's criminals in the last five years: catching criminals and leaving him just revenge from Bosnian Muslims.
It's so against the logic of filmmaking that it would be worth turning to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
At the same time, this film has a deep human message.
It considers that Karadz and Mladic are still at liberty, and suspects Americans and French (there are exceptionally united) that under secret political agreements they are not being prosecuted sufficiently intensively.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar, a woman will attack us with Brecht's famous poem.
In it is the wooden mask of the Asian demon on the work desk of the writer: "I look with compassion at the running lives on the forehead, noting: how hard it is to be evil."
In movies such as The Hunting Parties, they perform exactly the kind of crowded heads that but indicate how insistent it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the subject of war in the Balkans.
Recently, these newspapers reported that all Hollywood films about Iraq were very unsuccessful.
The only thing to add is that no good movie about South Africa has ever been filmed.
Almost always applies: When the star falls through the crisis area or passes through the mine fields, a film like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, the Breaking Lines with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonard DiCaprie will be produced.
Maybe all these conflicts are just too close to time.
Finally, they had to run away for decades before Hollywood could film a good movie about the Holocaust - Schindler's list.
Many films must probably grow up - films that are considered to be classic Vietnamese works - "Lovec dejelen", "Apocalypsa" or "Crowded West" - were never celebrated as master's works at the time.
But maybe today, when every mass murder at home is immediately found on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
Then the screenwriters do not have the ability needed to correct the right stories.
"To be or not to be" or "Great dictator" have become so good because Lubitch and Chaplin did not yet know how in a terrible way the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe a man shouldn't want to be good when he wants to make good movies.
Maybe he has to create a sarcastically measured artistic view as novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When he was drawn to a parallel between his historical novel "Lemprier's Dictionary" and "The Balkan War", he said, "The only thing that happens is that some things never change.
Capitals will always be very dangerous, people will always be killed in a terrible way, and there will always be a war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust criticises for rejecting the Olympics
The departure of the mayor from the Summer Olympics in Hamburg has come under severe political and economic criticism.
Many want to continue fighting for water games.
But Von Beust is pushing for realism in the estimation of chance.
The chief businessman of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, marked this decision on Wednesday as "in terms of business as unhappy".
No other project has recently awakened as much motivation in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this objective, it would not be possible to maintain this sporting political spirit to such a high degree."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury this project, but to create for it a new long-term concept "based on a changed time plan."
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday with his previous statements that the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg are at least unrealistic by 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Union will decide on the Olympic candidacy," von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December, the Sport Federation will decide on the nomination of Munich for the Winter Games in 2018.
"This preference for us means that we have no realistic chance with the 2028 schedule."
Yet this dream has not yet ended, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) marked von Beust's sermons as policing.
There's a feeling that Hamburg doesn't want to miss the Olympics in the next twenty-five years.
"It is too soon to destroy the chance that plans are already being identified as funerals at this early stage," President Günter Ploss said on Wednesday.
The denial of detention would be contrary to the statement of the senate chief, which he made to the General German High School Sports Association.
Von Beust here announced Hamburg's candidacy at the University in 2015 as a reward for organizing the Olympic Games.
The Hamburg High School Sports Association only nominated for the candidate city last week.
The SPD Group in the Hamburg Parliament of the Senate stated that it is wasting valuable time that could be used to build apartments in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grassbrook area has been delayed for years by the Senate, because it has set up the Olympics and excluded the building of apartments," SPD members Carol Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD for the Klein Grassbrook area was still planning the Olympics, with the entire area being later used for residential purposes, CDU unanimously placed on the "Olympian factor".
The year 2012 was marked by a great enthusiasm for the summer Olympics in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, has been hit by Lipsk.
They're not Warhol's boxes.
Whoever combines the expressions of Sweden and the wooden bed, doesn't mean Andy Warhol, but Ike.
Or is it?
Wooden beds currently made in Sweden cast on Warhol's list of dark shadows.
Most of it on the list of the ninety-four "Brillo Boxes" of the Stockholm type are forgeries.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago expressed doubts about the truth of Warhol's "Brillo Boxing" from 1968, the internal research of the Moderna Museum in Stockholm comes with a result that brought disappointment; six "Brillo Boxing" which in 1995 was donated by the Moderna Museum by its former director Pontus Hultén, are copies - like most of the other "Brillo Boxing" types of Stockholm that are on the international art market in circulation.
The previous events are wrapped up in a chain of art and curatorial actions.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, painted wooden beds that were based on red-and-white paper box design of Brillo powder.
His work at the Moderna Museum in 1968 presented - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo beads from the cardboard. They did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
It wasn't about the works of art, but about their designs, just the exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently also granted permission in 1968 to produce several wooded Brillo bedens in Sweden, but they are not exhibited in Moderna Museet.
The witness now speaks of fifteen poor people who have now entered the art and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warholovy Brillo Boxy" with the label Type Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned for over $100,000.
The problem now lies in the fact that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén museum later falsely claimed that in 1968, about a hundred beads were produced and exhibited in Sweden, which Warhol then abandoned him.
In fact, 105 of the Hulten poor were produced in Malmö for the exhibition in Petrograd only in 1990.
By that time Warhol was three years after he died.
Lars Byström, the top conservator of Moderna Museumet, examined in addition to six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, also three Brillo boxes from the Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and after their cross-sectional plates were made of basic colour and were decorated with white oil by the shield.
On the other hand, the structure of the 1990 copies revealed that the color was applied without the previous basic seal to the paint sheet directly – in addition, it is acrylic and not oil.
"These beddings were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the Warhol's official Brillo Box," said Moderna Museumet, Lars Nittve: "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York doesn't come to any other conclusions, Moderna Museumet will have to classify six been from its exhibition collections as "exhibition material - copy."
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced that these "complaint charges" that were brought up in the case of powdered powder boxes would be dealt with.
The organization, however, is still slowing down.
Rebellious soldiers in Manila surrender
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who confirmed in one hotel in Manila demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The rebel leader, Antonio Trillanes, who was exacerbating the president of manipulation and corruption in the elections, told the hotel's reporters that he refused responsibility for the bloodshed.
Soldiers of government have previously attacked the hotel with tear gas.
A few hours ago, about two dozen soldiers were confirmed in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them stood before the court for the moderated attempt to overthrow them in 2003, including Trillanes.
The conversation was used to get away with about 30 of his supporters.
Military policemen who were supposed to watch him obviously ran over to his side and joined the rebellion.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The government of the loyal unit closed the area around the selected hotel.
The President approved an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People already have enough," said Triallnes.
"We urge people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, the commander of the former Scout Rangers elite unit, said that other military units would join in the march in a short time.
Critics of the government called for a major demonstration against the President on Friday.
For months her government has been charged with corruption.
The financial area of Manila has already become the main cause of the rebellion of some 200 soldiers against Arroya in 2003.
Because the rebels refused to join the army, the rebellion broke out after just 24 hours.
Since 1986, at least seven attempts have been made to overthrow the democratically elected government in the Philippines.
