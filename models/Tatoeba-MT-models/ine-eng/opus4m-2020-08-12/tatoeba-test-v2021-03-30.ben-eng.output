Tom won't win.
Tom thinks you're stupid.
Stop yelling.
He doesn't have any work to do.
Do you have a bigger thing?
My book seemed attractive.
I don't know the answer.
I love to bite.
I don't want to go with you.
I'll be back in three weeks.
He doesn't eat anything but fruit.
What does "Tatoeba" mean?
Tom's okay?
Looks like I lost my key.
Who sent you?
Arrest that woman.
Did you get the whole thing?
Pakistan is a Muslim country.
Can you understand French?
I'll be back late.
Tom says he'll quit.
Eat!
Tom's gone.
Kids like to do this.
It's too bad for him.
Have you ever done that?
What's the profit?
What date is it today?
Bye.
He was angry.
I agree.
My father likes pizza.
Do you understand what he's saying?
I wrote a letter.
I like appeal.
Didn't you buy it yesterday?
Eat the puddle!
It's not true what you said.
They have two daughters.
Is there any room for children?
Come here!
Everyone ignored Tom.
I live in a small village.
Keep an eye on Tom.
How much is it?
Don't look!
We agree.
Tom went outside.
How are you?
Tom's really good at the guitar.
I don't want you.
Do you have my book?
I'll be back later.
Tom Mary's rule.
Don't open it.
Come in.
Tom's teaching me French.
Would you mind if I sit next to you?
Then there's trouble.
My neighbor's name is Tom Jackson.
I don't know what to say.
Yesterday was my last birthday.
Tom, where else are you going?
I need a wallet lock.
You have to eat this soup.
Who can you take a vacation someday?
I want to change my ticket.
Tom's obviously not happy.
Eat whatever you like.
They all yelled.
It's too late.
Let's go.
I couldn't get my hands on it.
I had a twin.
Don't wait.
How much time did it take?
It's us.
Why don't you try and get your money back?
Can I see your passport?
I can't find a word.
How can you be so calm?
Eat whatever you want.
Rome in Italy.
Tom's tired.
I can handle this.
When will you come back?
Can you speak French?
I'll never let you do this alone.
The roof of Mount Everest is said to be the earth.
I sat down.
Come back.
Tom tried to keep his face up.
Tom's dead.
Tom was crying like a kid.
Let him go.
I can't recognize another person from a birth.
I'm reading your book.
Don't worry.
He was talking.
Can I eat?
It's too long for Tom Mary.
The kid's squeezing.
I'm gonna have to sleep.
Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, seven; Asshur, nine; one hundred.
He reads the book in the evening.
I'm gonna win.
Take your room.
I won't do this.
Good night!
They're all running.
There are many branches of science.
No, not me, you!
Look at the bike riders and the passengers!
You always complain.
For what?
I want to open an account.
You need to cut off the ticket when you go to the bus.
It's not hard to learn French.
I'm cold.
I bought a pound of meat the other day.
Speak in front of your face!
Everything all right?
Linkon died in 1865.
We've failed.
How many rooms do I have?
He's not here yet.
Find Tom.
I don't want to go with you.
Hurry up, Tom.
The church's clock is ticking.
Let me go.
I accepted his invitation.
They have two twin girls.
Do you have a car?
You're very brave.
Don't hurt me.
Do you have a bike?
The most important thing you can do now is to stay calm.
Where's the free stuff shop?
Look at Tom.
How many nights will you stay?
I'm going to school.
My neck's a little dry.
I have a new red car.
Dakis me.
Keep an eye on Tom.
"Why don't you go?" "Because I don't want to go."
You're not the first person to tell me this.
He's eating.
Tom's a good swimmer.
Doesn't it work?
He doesn't want to talk about it.
I've learned a lot from you.
Cover me.
Do you have a car?
Are you eating meat?
Is there any other way to get there?
No one likes it here.
You're not paying attention.
Can you show Tom around?
Take it.
Please acknowledge my sincere apology.
You got something to tell me?
I can't understand you.
Don't eat anything but fruit.
I accepted his invitation.
Tom's okay?
You're a doctor.
Tom wanted to talk to you.
What are you doing?
Only one language is available.
Don't move!
They yelled.
My dad's always angry.
Tom wants to catch an empty fish.
He's close.
I like him.
That was important.
Tom closed his eyes.
Where's your stuff?
Tom chipped the Patillebuta.
How many people do you have at your party?
You should sleep.
I want Tom to come here.
It'll be ten years in April.
Tom's been waiting.
He knows where we are.
What are you doing?
He's a doctor.
You can eat whatever you want.
I've been working as a weather worker for three years.
Tom was there.
You run.
Touch Tom.
We can't sleep for words.
He can speak French.
I got your letter.
I agree.
Got it.
Tom's not happy about it.
I like her.
You're big.
I don't want to go to sleep.
I like my mother's music.
Is this the way to go to the station?
Do you have a bike?
You always complain.
Do you eat meat?
My thighs are hurting.
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
Can you play piano?
Look at Tom.
I got a call today from Tom.
Listen to my song.
I want to buy the anchors.
What is your name?
Don't yell!
The river is sinking into the Pacific Ocean.
Why are you shouting?
I like to write songs in French.
Tom needs a friend.
Nice to see you again.
How do you expect me to do this alone?
I saw him run.
I don't want to eat now.
Make yourself comfortable.
I know Tom was your friend.
Stop spying on me.
How many gorges have you seen in the past?
How do I go to the airport?
I need a doctor!
Tom's squeezing.
Tom, I'm a little busy here.
He's launching now.
I just found her home.
I promised you.
That's mine.
We'll win.
You can eat whatever you want.
I can't find my wallet.
When did Boston train leave?
How deep?
I ran outside.
I don't care what he doesn't do.
Here's your bag.
I didn't forget.
We write our own songs.
Are you okay?
I'll try hard not to bother you with your study.
Trust me.
I'm sorry to be late.
He can say whatever he wants.
Were you there?
I know your name.
What's the ticket for the music organization?
Tom was talking.
I'm your friend, right?
How long does it take you to get out of here by taxi and train station?
Tom will yell.
Tom wanted to talk to you.
I'll be back in 20 minutes to take you.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
I accepted his invitation.
What does that mean?
I saw Tom last night.
You couldn't understand.
They all slammed.
Would you please be able to talk more slowly?
Which tooth is it?
The woman eats the pudding.
Tom wanted you to do it.
I'm done.
My dad can fly a plane.
Who doesn't want to win?
He's eating fruit.
Attack!
Tom screamed.
Tom said Mary allowed him to leave quickly.
What's this book from Tom?
You're so long!
It's noon.
Don't leave me alone.
Where can I buy stamps from?
I heard a scream.
Will you come down?
I'm sick.
Tom's been lying about his age to get into the club.
You can stay as long as you want.
He's sleeping like kids.
I didn't notice.
Do you eat meat?
I want to cut my finger.
Don't stop here.
Forgive me, but it's not possible.
I want your opinion.
Who your friend needs to remember.
This object can be easily expanded.
Can you please say what you said?
I totally agree.
You go first.
Take us to the hospital.
I'm not your friend.
He ran.
I lost your phone number.
Get out of here!
Are you going to fish with us?
How old was he?
Tom's reading me French.
It seemed slow to see it.
More water.
I love to go around.
I shouldn't be logged out.
Why?
Tom's breathing very strongly.
I know we still love each other.
Forgive me, I've been waiting for you.
What have you got?
Sit here.
There's a lot of trouble at the hospital.
He's asking how it's possible.
I told them to send another ticket.
I can't believe it!
Tom will talk.
He explained the literal meaning of the phrase.
It's your fault.
Read it first.
How old is your father?
I saw that my mother was busy wearing some clothes.
How much did you eat?
I'm not your friend.
I'm not yelling.
What does that word mean?
Wait outside.
Can you take me to the Grand Hotel?
I don't deny it.
Puzzle fun stuff.
They need friends.
Why don't you try and get your money back?
Tom Mary was scared.
If he were to follow his doctor's advice, he might still be alive.
What is the purpose of your trip?
Tom can read French.
Ask Tom.
Don't yell!
What's next stop?
Why don't you come with us?
When I go to pee, my neck hurts.
I'm dancing.
We often eat together.
He's a doctor.
Is he an American?
I'm so tired.
Tom died three days later.
Tom was asleep on the train.
I'm lost.
He's speaking French.
How much bus rent?
The meeting place and tomorrow are both fixed.
Call my husband.
The government's been whistling.
Tom lives with us.
What's your full name?
Tom was playing guitar.
Rule is rule.
I'm happy to help you.
Do you understand?
I don't know if I have time.
How much money does it take to get inside?
I want our full speech.
I've seen them.
He eats a little more.
I'm an honest man.
Tom's over there.
How can you be so calm?
The capital of Bangkok Thailand.
Look down.
How old is the universe?
Someone's here.
It's starting now.
He's trying.
Maybe you're wondering how I got to know that thing.
Don't stop.
Everyone saw it.
We're here, too.
My name is Emily.
Where can I buy a book from?
Do you know what he said?
It's a shame.
I'm playing right now.
Call the hospital.
I can't get my wallet.
Let me talk.
Open the door.
We're here.
Ask Alex.
My father's going to China.
I didn't eat.
Tom's lying.
Don't think of us in any way.
I'll be back before midnight.
Come with me.
Get out of here.
Mary's a very handsome girl.
Where's the hospital in the neighborhood?
Where's the knife?
That was a hell of a bitch.
I like black.
I trust you.
Do you have a stomach ulcer?
I'm having an empty time.
They yelled.
He's asking how it's possible.
I forgot to call her today.
I saw her wash the car.
Tom's out of breath.
It's smaller than me.
How long have you been in Boston?
How am I supposed to go to the station?
Tom thought the tabiz would save him from the hands of the dinnies.
It's easier for me to write about death than to write about life.
I heard you scream.
He doesn't want to talk about it.
Don't leave me alone.
Please eat something.
He's not here yet.
My father's home.
There's a bitch in the kitchen!
I'm a student.
My dad's open.
I think you two know Tom.
How many nights are you staying?
I didn't say anything.
You should ask her for advice.
I'm not a doctor.
Everyone was screaming.
Who's coming?
Hurry up, Tom.
We went back to South America.
What is your favorite TV program?
They have a gun.
My wallet's in Dickie.
You really don't matter.
What do you want?
He can say whatever he wants.
How long does it stop?
There's no one in there.
You need a friend.
My neck's hurting.
Shut up.
Contact Tom.
I want you to talk to Tom.
I respect the big ones.
Spanish his mother tongue.
They don't know.
When was the Lord’s Evening Meal in Japan?
Tom's never been so happy.
Don't sing.
They need a friend.
I heard you scream.
Don't eat anything but fruit.
He doesn't eat anything but fruit.
Be careful!
No one can do that.
I'm perfect.
What's your hat?
He can say anything he wants.
I only have one pack.
Don't talk to Tom like that.
He was speaking.
What language is spoken in the United States?
I'll read English.
Let us in.
He was speaking.
He's not here yet.
Is that your book?
I went outside.
Tom's grown up in the box.
There's nothing I can do.
Would you like some more?
Seven are already gone.
I haven't done this for many years.
How much money do you want?
Democracy inspires freedom.
I like tea.
How much is it worth?
I can kill you.
Tom's squealing.
I don't think it'll rain tomorrow.
I can speak an empty French language.
I don't want you to go.
My dad's busy.
Seven are already gone.
I was in Rome.
Hurry up.
I can keep my hands on the floor without breaking my hand.
The police ordered us to follow.
You're a doctor.
Try to stay calm.
I'm so happy for Tom.
How old is he?
I don't think it'll rain tomorrow.
Can I get some towels?
It's not always easy to do the right thing.
Cut off the airport bus?
He can speak French.
It's your key.
I can't.
A car hit Tom.
What a strange thing!
I don't want Tom to see me that way.
He can speak French.
There's a problem with being alone that no one likes to talk.
Have you ever gone to Boston?
That's a bad sign.
You can teach here.
I'll call them one time tomorrow when I get back.
Come in two hours.
I know Tom is tired.
I want some money.
Tom's dead.
Tom wanted to talk to you.
I'll keep an eye on it.
No one in Boston knows me.
Contact Tom.
It's been snowing all night.
Which floor is it?
I'm gonna need a cab tomorrow night.
I heard you sneezing.
I can't see you.
I don't understand what you're saying.
How long are you gonna go to sleep?
You're gonna have to do something about it.
I come in €100 a day.
It's been melancholy.
Please reduce the volume.
Are you crazy?
They're running.
Turn left.
I killed Tom.
The library on the left.
What does that mean?
Mary's squeezing.
I teach English.
Eat what you like.
There's no doubt about it.
Kids like cake.
Tom Jackson is your real name?
Tom's dead.
Tell me what you need.
I haven't found my contact lens yet.
Tom's dog was scared.
Tom saw him.
Your bike is like my bike.
Why do you want to go today?
Sit down.
Drive carefully.
I'm watching TV.
Don't cry.
Tom wanted you to take it.
What have you got?
She told me she was going to Venice.
Listen carefully.
Can you believe it?
He's smaller than me.
I don't speak Japanese.
We're both right.
Tom slept outside.
Sit down.
Don't worry about me.
It's been melancholy.
What happened?
I agree with you.
How much is it worth?
How can they forget us?
I understand your situation.
I'm not Tom.
That's funny!
My book is here.
I'm Tom's wife.
I'm not very busy right now.
Where are you going Monday?
They screamed.
Tom Jackson wrote three books.
Tom told me that today.
I don't want to go to Boston.
Your answer is wrong.
I know.
I'm having a little fun.
I'm not proud of it.
He's running.
The train was just about time, so we didn't have to wait.
I'm not your friend.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Come with me.
Is that your new girlfriend?
You can write in any language, all the same in Tatoeba.
I left the room. I don't know why I don't, I never feel satisfied seeing you.
He can come.
He's an important person.
The train stops at every station.
I didn't care.
I didn't get the money now.
Where's the mistake?
I can't attend the meeting.
This is a doctor.
I'm going to the next station.
Are you a doctor?
I'm eating now.
You should ask him for advice.
In March 1991 he was killed by Harbat.
My son knows how to watch.
I'm looking for a good hotel.
I'm a woman.
I'll be back in ten hours.
Don't be fooled.
I don't want to look at Tom.
He's a doctor.
Bye.
Looks like you're sick.
I want a guitar.
Do I have to save the train?
Is that blood?
Call me tomorrow.
Weather, get me some water.
Let's find Tom.
My mother can play a great piano.
Can you speak French?
We'll eat now.
We win.
I went to Rome.
Please fill in this form.
We've seen it.
I'm glad to see you again.
They don't know.
How old do you want to get married?
It was too late to go to school.
Forgive Tom.
Who wanted to hurt Tom?
No one believes in hell today.
Let him go.
I'm hopeful.
Tom kept shouting.
How are you?
He can speak French.
How old is this church?
Before my passport expires, I want to go back to Australia.
Sit right there.
You can go there.
I don't want to get involved in all this.
How many nights are you staying?
Is your husband at home?
This is Japanese.
Tom's running.
We love coffee.
Let's hear what Tom has to say.
Tom loves me.
What did you forget?
I live here.
Tom's been crying almost every day.
He cleaned up his room and broke it.
Tom brought it.
I like him.
I'll eat.
Can you please say one more time?
I'll be back in three hours.
I'm yours.
Take Tom to the hospital.
Take my hand.
How can they forget us?
That's why you don't want to be alone.
Are you going to cry with me?
How old are you?
Don't go to the dining room.
Call me tomorrow.
Sit wherever you want.
Tom doesn't want to hear it.
We're Arab.
Tom was hurt.
Where are you?
Smile a little.
I lost your phone number.
Everyone's here.
Will you eat something?
I can cut the sweat.
There's nothing left in the fridge.
Nothing happened.
Everyone's lying.
I'm your friend.
Time's up.
Try more.
Have you ever eaten fish before?
He's talking.
I like him.
How long you are!
I did my job.
I want my chair.
I knew it.
I don't like my body.
Wherever he went, his dog would follow him.
You're not a doctor?
I saw him run.
Tom's a boy's name and Mary's a girl's name.
Tom's in trouble, isn't he?
What's your name?
Let's get the fuck out of here.
What's the price?
Do what he says.
I think the train's late.
It's been melancholy.
I have two friends.
Keep it.
Nobody's talking.
Tom's talking.
I'm shaking.
What am I eating?
Keep Tom away from me.
What's your father's name?
I want some money.
Eat your milk.
The people of Madrid are amazed.
People can't see the past.
Let me tell you.
Tom likes Daba.
I want you to come with me.
Tom Bhuru Khuchalo.
Tom was angry.
I don't like our coffee.
Stay here.
Eat the puddle!
I heard you yell.
Call me.
Welcome.
I want to buy some cheese.
Call the doctor!
I'm not worried.
Is this site empty?
We win.
My brother is two years older than me.
Stop!
The hotel was built last year.
Eat everything.
I want my guitar.
Stop that woman.
What will you do tomorrow?
Don't talk.
You can write in any language. All languages in Tatoeba are the same.
They're there.
It's his home.
Forty million people speak English as their first language.
This house is my favorite.
Where can I buy food from?
Let her go.
I forgot his name.
He doesn't eat anything but fruit.
Tom was with me all day.
How long will it take to get to the station?
Who ate?
Where can I buy tickets from?
How old is your grandfather?
He can say Japanese.
How many homes do I have to take to walk to Wikiki?
My feet are hurting.
How many students do we have?
You can teach here.
Tom seems happy and excited.
He's younger than me.
Tom chocolate cake really likes it.
I'll go now.
Have fun.
I came back late last night.
You didn't get cold, did you?
Eat whatever you want.
Don't call me.
Is it too far from here?
Where's the boy?
How long did New York train last?
I'm on my way.
I like her.
Do you want to learn French?
Do you understand what I'm saying?
No one understands me.
Let's go.
New country.
He's sleeping like kids.
Can you show me your boarding pass?
Can you please help me?
It's smaller than me.
It's never easy to win.
I'll fix it.
Do you have time?
I thought you'd be here.
Tom's in a lot of trouble.
I'm busy.
You can go home now.
He's younger than me.
I think Tom's fine.
I'll be back in Australia in two days.
Tom told Mary that he was going to kill himself, but he wasn't as brave as he was.
Are you going to fish with us?
Although it's not bad itself, in many cases, many people watch too much television.
You should ask him for advice.
I'll take him.
I'm cold.
I'm sorry.
I'm still your friend.
I still can't believe I believed Tom.
Be careful.
My son can't listen yet.
Take a look at the car.
I'll eat.
I don't want to be alone.
How far is the station from here?
She got sick by the end of last week.
Tom pushed the door again, but no one broke.
He's a doctor.
Stop scanning.
My head's broken.
Go to the hospital.
The ambassador's back.
Please proceed with the nine.
The pan is broken.
Tom always remembers him.
He doesn't eat anything but fruit.
I deny it.
Wait outside.
I want a cab now.
Shut up.
Who is he?
That's what happened at least three times.
Tom wants me to go with him.
We'll try it once!
Tom's tired.
Don't forget what we're saying.
Tom kept talking.
I've been south.
You're tired.
Tom's been waiting for me all afternoon.
He's eating.
I was sick by the end of last week.
I'll see you next month.
Tom's dad needs us to contact his mother.
Where can I buy that paper from?
I'll be back in seven hours.
Is the heart too deep?
I'm late.
Call Tom.
How much is it?
Tom saw him.
What time is your plane?
Tom's long, but not as long as me.
He's my wife.
I'm not very good at washing.
Where's the travel office?
Don't go.
Your shoes are here.
He didn't tell me his name.
Okay, I'll see you later.
Are you here?
What happened?
$100 with home heavy tax.
I'm not very good at French.
My dad's going to China.
Can he speak French?
I want it.
I'm your friend, right?
Help me!
I'll help you.
I don't agree with him.
Call the police!
I was worried.
There's a cup on the table.
I'll be back in an hour.
I have to get out of this ship.
It's Tom.
He's not here yet.
Kim smiles in a nice way.
I'm not in town.
Women change the world.
Just hurry up.
I don't want Tom to see me in this state.
Tom started screaming.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
It'll cost €30.
Start here.
We were waiting for them.
I like the yellow color.
Tom decided to keep a diary.
He doesn't eat anything but fruit.
I'm not your friend.
How old is he?
Come back.
Why are you shouting?
Can I get the check?
Do you have anything bigger?
Tom's coming double from me.
That's what I need.
I don't think you need any help.
Tom was waiting outside the gate.
Don't wait.
Is the magic open today?
Don't wait.
Don't worry about me.
Shall we eat outside today?
Keep Tom away from me.
Tom's hurt.
He's gone.
What are my London clothes made for?
Where can I buy this from?
I need to send a fax.
He eats a little more.
He taught me to write.
Call my husband.
I could play that song.
I was surprised.
Where's Boston?
We're in Dakis.
The rules are simple.
Can you keep an eye on Tom?
You're better than me.
He's not here yet.
I can't turn my right hand.
I'm at the hospital.
Tom caught the thief.
Tom, I want to talk to Mary.
Can you understand what I'm saying?
When Tom heard that Mary had married John, he was surprised to see her.
Most success depends on effort.
Tom was laughing.
Tom blew his head off.
Were you born there?
Everyone knows it now.
I got my shoes.
I was surprised.
Do you keep on doing this?
Is there a tooth on the lid?
The connection has been disconnected.
Can I get a chair?
Have you ever broken your bones?
I want to call the next stop.
How are you?
I'll go see the dentist tomorrow.
I can't believe it!
Isn't that right?
He's not here yet.
They're doctors.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
You ever ride a horse?
He was talking.
I have two brothers.
What's the matter with you?
I didn't have to tell Tom anything.
Try harder.
Tom moved.
Why are you sitting there?
What languages are spoken in the United States?
I'm tired.
He has two daughters.
I want you to talk to Tom.
I'm your friend.
Follow Tom.
Tom always remembers him.
He's an experienced teacher.

Tom was helping me.
Let him go.
Let's wait here.
How much time does the shuttle bus leave for the airport?
Stay home.
Tell me what you want.
I don't know if I'll have time to do this.
Tom's keeping his word.
I want you to call Tom.
Tom bought some light.
Tom's gone.
You go ahead.
We've eaten all night.
School's about to start tomorrow.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I'm not waiting.
I don't think Tom hates you.
Which floor is it?
A soccer game.
The sky's clear.
Good luck!
I'm really celebrating your gift.
She told me she was going to Venice.
What's your phone number?
He's standing.
What does this sign mean?
The letter was written.
Stop here.
Tom saw you.
Come with me.
No, thank you.
Wait here.
Am I a little late?
Let her go.
I can't say right.
Language Hello is a means of communication.
Tom knows that.
I've never even heard of Tom.
How long is the next train for Tokyo?
Tom's taking a big risk.
Are those yours?
What are you talking about?
I'll work.
What's your name?
I agree with you.
You're rich.
Are you going to America next month?
I don't want to go to the pool.
I'm not the owner.
Thank you very much.
He's not here yet.
I'm sorry!
You want me to tell you how much.
The snow is a reflection of hunger.
Come out.
They screamed.
I ran away from home.
We made pancakes for surprise.
Don't you have a bike?
I don't know if he's coming.
You're yelling.
He's dead.
He doesn't want to talk about it.
Everyone saw it.
I'll give my brother-in-law a meal every morning and evening.
My son came to my house.
I'm a student.
I'll be there.
Do you have your passport?
Please just give me my speech.
Do what he says.
You're tired.
Tom started screaming.
Sit there.
I wasn't alone.
I've learned a lot from you.
It's wrong.
Tom always remembers him.
Is Tom here?
I'm a doctor.
We've seen them.
Today is June 18th and today is the birthday of Muriel.
Who won?
Come on, let's get ready.
We're gonna have to get Tom to do this and we're gonna have to do this, right?
Can I get these clothes out of here?
I'm going to Osaka Station.
I don't think Tom is responsible for this.
Someone's a coward.
I went to the bakery.
I've learned to live without him.
My dad's very good.
I want you to stay with Tom.
Hurry up.
Tom was very busy with the job.
I'm not proud of the way I used it.
I did.
We'll work.
He's here.
I don't agree with him.
Come to me.
I'm shaking.
My watch doesn't work properly.
Forget Tom.
What courage!
Is this Tom's book?
He's gone mad.
Who are you?
I could have died.
Are you sure?
We have to go now.
He neglects to read.
I didn't want Tom to see me.
They eat healthy food.
My mother loves music.
He'll just warm his head.
Wherever you go, his dog would follow him.
Who's that?
Can I work here?
There's still a problem.
It's my fault to collect the old bottles.
I like my score.
I don't want to go.
When will the next bus leave?
What does that mean?
Don't you have a bike?
What do you want to come for?
My mother can play a great golf game.
He knows where we are.
I know your name.
Tom's not here anymore.
What did you say?
He worked as our guide.
Tom stopped shouting.
How old is Tom?
Come quickly!
Shut the fuck up.
Was Tom there?
I was bleeding this afternoon.
My back's still getting sick.
Where's Tom?
They look like Americans.
You were Tom's only friend.
I went to the hospital.
I accepted his invitation.
My father can drive a very good car.
I'll be alone.
You need a friend.
Forget Tom.
I think Tom said his name was Jackson.
You've known Tom for days.
I know.
I'm playing football now.
My wallet hasn't arrived yet.
Tom hasn't come here yet.
Please wait until he arrives.
Tom doesn't care about him.
Something to eat.
Is there anyone at home?
What are you doing?
I think Tom's fine.
Where do I get the stamp?
I'm going to pee.
Can he speak French?
Tom might want to take it.
We love our country.
Is he a doctor?
And a little nibby?
And one day he left.
They wanted to steal the car.
I'm still your friend.
Arrest that woman.
How old is that church?
Ask me tomorrow.
It's still mine.
Where am I going to demand my credit card?
We do what we want.
Tom's fine.
I ran to my mother.
This book is for all students whose mother tongue is not Japanese.
Tom wanted to be Minister.
Who would you believe?
He's a doctor.
You can talk.
That's what I deserve.
No one is indispensable.
Do you live here?
Everyone else laughed.
How many nights will you stay?
Have you seen the man in this picture?
I've lost my wallet.
I think it's impossible for Tom.
I don't want to wake Tom.
My son's having an economy.
The sky seems to be starting to snow tonight.
How much would it cost?
You know exactly what Tom wants.
We'll dance.
I can't stop Kashi.
I want Tom to be happy.
Those in the glass room should not tear the stones.
Why are you shouting?
Stop Tom.
I think I should go to the hospital.
Tom wants his roof back.
Is Tom home?
Tom always keeps his word.
I'm going to eat an accident.
I'm your friend.
How long have you been?
Who's here?
The city is divided by a river east and west.
Come and see for yourself.
Do you understand what he says?
I have to go to sleep.
You got a car?
Tom also plays guitar.
Are you thinking about doing something now?
He's launching now.
Can you watch Tom?
You should ask him for advice.
This tooth is getting sick.
How many of these lights?
How much more do you have to give?
Everyone liked Tom.
What happened here?
Here's your key.
Are you a Japanese citizen?
Just hurry up.
Eat whatever you like.
Take this.
Have you ever broken your bones?
He's gone mad.
We learned English.
I couldn't swim on my right side.
I'm dry.
How old are you?
Can I ask you a question?
What's that?
Here's your key.
We've seen worse things.
Help Tom.
I'm almost sure.
What's that?
He's eating.
Khargosh likes Gaza.
You couldn't understand.
My mother's hurting.
Sit on the table.
He's smaller than me.
What is your name?
We were waiting for you.
Tom was inside.
Can I use the credit card?
It's a big night, isn't it?
This book can only be found in French.
Tell me.
I'll take him.
Can I pay with the credit card?
Tom found my bike.
I went home to Jackson.
He had a black hat.
Anything else?
Everybody's running.
Is there any room for students?
I eat noodles.
Tom's in the house.
Don't ask how they're doing, ask what they're doing.
Will you come in?
I'm telling you.
We like soccer.
Will you eat?
Good evening.
He ate the empty fruit.
I want new shoes.
Everyone liked Tom.
Who's that?
I'm still your friend.
Enjoy.
Please listen!
He's running.
Tomorrow I'll go and cut the wet.
My right shoulder is hurting.
My father was busy.
Everyone's ready to go.
I couldn't catch the 70,000 train.
There were two of his daughters.
This is my wife.
Let's talk.
You want a pan?
The class doesn't start until eight o'clock.
Do you have time for the launch anyway?
What does that word mean?
How much do I get?
Can you speak English?
What they did was wrong.
My son is taller than me.
Tom's father-in-law was a singer.
Here you go.
Tom's alive.
She's showing him in the fax.
Answer me.
This bag is mine.
Tom was angry.
How much is it worth?
You can eat as much as you want.
Let go.
I'm a little hot.
Can you speak French?
He's a doctor.
Please fill in.
How old are you?
Get Tom.
They're running.
You're yelling.
I don't think it'll rain tomorrow.
I'll be back when I'm done.
I like the star.
He's grown up in France.
He didn't work Sunday night.
He taught me to write.
Happy birthday!
It's not your book. It's mine.
Three people were killed.
Don't eat anything but fruit.
Tom's father is a murderer.
Listen.
Do you think Tom wants to eat now?
Now it's time.
I'm never wrong.
Where's the door to the UA 111?
I'm sick.
Why are you crying?
Tom wants his roof back.
How long do you usually go to sleep?
The country has entered into an agreement with each other.
I speak to Tom in an empty French language.
Tom's eyebrows.
Can you apply it to the gift?
Tom's on the fence now.
What have you forgotten?
I don't really want to go.
You go first.
That's my sister.
I forgot.
He made a move.
He's not here yet.
It's not mine.
Who's here?
He's eating fruit.
I don't speak Japanese.
I'll be grateful.
Terrorists have released prisoners.
I could go with you, but I didn't have time.
I've lost my nickname.
He's a good man.
We did it.
The government's been whistling.
Get out of town!
Play for threes.
He's eating.
How old is that church?
Let's go!
This is Japanese.
Did you see him grow up?
Did you leave the shuttle for the airport?
Don't fight.
That's my bitch.
That bag's mine.
I have an old computer that I don't need anymore.
I've got a bite.
We were on our feet.
I want it.
I need those papers.
Tom yelled.
Tom's in a very low mood.
Eat what you want.
Tom's crying.
How much is it worth?
I'm fine.
They're doctors.
The plane's on the right course.
I don't know what you mean.
Most of the viewers were businessmen.
Turn right.
Tom's probably asleep.
I've got a lot of money.
Tom won a lot of races.
He knows where we are.
I learned a lot from Tom.
Wash the Tom's candles.
Everyone was screaming.
I'll stay outside.
My mom can have a good meal.
They're running.
The research was successful.
I think Tom's got very little chance of keeping the gold he's got.
Boston is a big city.
I'm 17.
Here's your key.
Leave Tom alone.
Eat your milk.
The name of the two of us is Tom.
They were all happy.
Is this your book?
I don't want to go with Tom.
Who broke the fuldanite?
Tom's hurt.
Follow Tom.
Tom's still mad at me?
Tom's gone.
We were waiting for you.
I'm not sure.
Do you know what he said?
Listen carefully.
We've made a lot of mistakes.
Why are you shouting?
What's your father's name?
Look over there.
I'll let you know if I do anything.
We tried.
Tom resigned in October.
The market is next to the doctor's office.
Happy Canada Day!
I'll be late.
What does this sign mean?
Tom blew his head off.
Are we ready?
I like Tom's Blue Ones.
He was very patient.
How old are you?
Listen carefully.
Are you going to cry with me?
Take it easy.
They're there.
I'll take care of it.
Everyone's clean.
Don't hurt me.
Who was it?
I'm a coward.
When I said Mary left town, Tom was really surprised to see her.
I heard a scream.
What time is your plane?
He doesn't want to talk about it.
My book seemed attractive.
Tell me what happened.
I'm up at 8:00 today.
Please light the light.
Tom was hurt.
I'm still your friend.
It took me two hours to translate a few pages of English.
Are those yours?
Who is he?
Is this the shortest way to go to the station?
Tom tried to kill Mary.
What are you doing with him?
It's impossible!
Is Yokohama arriving at the time of the train?
How bad is it now?
Words that don't correct are not correct, you can add more normal translations instead.
Your shoes are here.
Are you ready for tomorrow?
Has anyone left any news for me?
I want to eat for you.
Listen, does this train last for the Washington Square?
We failed.
There's an AC in this house.
Did you come all the way?
Tom Boston was gone.
Clean it up.
Don't open that.
Tom saw him.
It's snowing in the evening.
I'm not proud of him.
Is anyone there?
It's wrong.
I'm not young anymore.
He's eating.
It's just blood.
Will you go fishing with us?
Wait right here.
I'll be back in 20 minutes.
One minute.
Tom was hurt.
Mary explained.
I don't deny it.
Don't look!
Do it as quickly as possible.
Use it.
Is Yokohama arriving at the time of the train?
I don't understand that either.
I'm up seven this morning.
I'm home.
Take it easy.
Good morning!
I'm in.
Me, too.
I'm not too busy.
It's beautiful.
Do it again!
Tom started to cry.
They're children.
I don't want to argue with you.
"Why don't you go?" "Because I don't want to go."
I know that.
I'll stay close.
Call me tomorrow.
Tell me what you want.
My feet are hurting.
Ask Tom.
I'm thinking about what I'll give you on your birthday.
Don't forget the ticket.
Good to see you again.
Why are you shouting?
Stay right there.
Eat what you like.
We were playing the park.
I'm busy.
Where can I buy tickets from?
I'm done.
I'm planning on staying at the hotel.
I finally got my keys.
Tom started screaming.
I'm not arguing.
Can you read?
How old is your father?
Are you okay?
I've never seen Tom happy.
You're not going in.
We're lost.
Tom's squeezing.
We can still do that.
I tried.
I'm sick.
I'm looking empty, thank you.
Unfortunately it's true.
We were waiting for them.
How old do I think I am?
Tom's not happy here.
Inni was angry.
I don't like to eat coffee.
Talk more slowly.
Can I get your phone number?
Why do you want to see Tom?
Here you go.
We don't do what he doesn't do.
I called my best friend Tom.
We can never play better than that.
We're devious.
The bill can be destroyed today.
Tomorrow I'm going to Paris.
You'll never be alone.
You can go there.
We both know it's not right.
Eat what you like.
I have wine.
Why did Tom cry?
