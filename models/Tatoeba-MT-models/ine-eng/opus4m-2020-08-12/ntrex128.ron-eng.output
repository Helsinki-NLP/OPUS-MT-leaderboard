Members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned that they might be "marionets"
Several members of the National Assembly of Wales are shocked because they were suggested to change their title, namely MWP (members of the Parliament of the country of Wales).
This problem was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting within the National Parliament of Wales.
Members of the National Assembly of Wales on the political scene are afraid that this would cause ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party of the National Assembly of Wales is concerned that he "remains with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside the country of Wales: in Galese, "twp" means "obtuz" and "pwp" means "fecal matter".
A member of the Gali Party of the National Assembly of Gali said that the group "is not pleased" and suggested alternatives as a whole.
A member of the Conservative Party said that the group had an "open" attitude towards the name change, but that it also observed that "MWP" is similar to "Muppet".
In this context, the letter "w" is pronounced in Wales as the letter "u" in the English language spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing the legislation introducing the name change, said: "The final decision on how members of the Assembly are appointed will certainly depend on those members."
The 2017 Law on the Government of the Gali State gave the Assembly the opportunity to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed that many of them wish to use the 'Parliament of Wales'.
With regard to the title of the members of the National Assembly of Wales, the Commission preferred "Members of the Parliament of Wales" or "WMP", but the option "MWP" received most votes in the public consultation.
It seems that the members of the National Assembly of Wales have suggested alternative options, but trying to reach a consensus could give Elin Jones, chairman of the Steering Committee, who is expected to send the draft law on changes over a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes in the way the assembly operates, including rules on the disqualification of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will have the last word on their title when the law is discussed.
Macedonians are voting for the referendum on the change of country name
This Sunday, citizens with the right to vote will express their views on changing their country's name to "North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organised to resolve an old dispute for decades with Greece, the neighbouring country, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The government of Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim about its territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia 's accession to the EU and NATO .
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a fierce opponent of the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would not take this vote into account.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that changing the name is only a compromise that will enable them to join the EU and NATO.
Church bells St. Martin stopped fighting as a result of the problems facing the churches in Harlem
"Historicly, the veterans of the place I was talking to told me that before, you had found a bar and a church at every corner of the street," Adams said.
"Today, there are no more bars and churches."
He said the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People otherwise socialise today," he said.
"Bars no longer have the role of living room for the entire neighborhood, where people usually hang themselves."
And with regard to the churches, it is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will be spent more quickly than expected by the leaders and that, " sooner or later, the same will be the case".
He added that the churches could be replaced by residential buildings with condominiums full of people who would not support the remaining sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white," he said, "so this will accelerate the closure of the churches, because it is unlikely that many of the people moving in these condominiums will become members of those churches."
Both churches were built by congregations made of white people before Harlem became a metropolis of African-American people – St. Martin Metropolitan Community in 1870, a decade ago.
The original Methodist Congregation, composed of white people, moved from that area after 1930.
An African - American congregation, which carried out its religious activities close by, took over the building.
St. Martin Church was taken over by an African-American congregation, led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted traders on 125th Street, a main street for the purchases of Harlem, who opposed the employment or promotion of African-American people.
A fire that took place in 1939 affected the building very much, but Father Johnson's fans made plans to rebuild it and included the carilon in it.
Reverend David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's church, called the carilon "the bells of the poor".
The expert who put the carilon into operation in July described it differently: "a cultural chamber" and "a historical instrument of unreplaced".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, further stated that it was the first carilion in the world operated by an African-American musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who passed to a larger carilion, to the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said it wasn't replaced by St. Martin.
What St. Martin heard in recent months was a complicated story, which included architects and contractors, some brought by church deacons, others by the bishop diocese.
The Sacristia, the governing entity of the parish, formed from the diocese, wrote to the diocese in July to complain that the diocese "will seek to pass the costs" to the sanctuaries, even though it was not involved in the engagement of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some of the jury complained about the lack of transparency of the diocese.
A shark hurt a 13-year-old kid trying to catch lobsters in California
According to the authorities, on Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old child while he was swimming, trying to catch lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m., near the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel said to the position of KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was swimming for about half an hour, along with his friends, on Saturday morning, when he heard a boy crying for help and then moved in with a group that helped him get out of the water.
Hammel also said that initially, he thought the boy was glad he caught a lobster, but then he realized that the cry "He bit me!
He bit me!"
The whole key was broken, Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
"I called all those who were in the water and told them to get out of the water: "It's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was taken with the helicopter to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
There is no known species of shark responsible for the attack.
Salvamar, Captain Larry Giles, said at a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks ago, but it was concluded that it is not a species of shark that poses a danger.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma at the top of the trunk.
The authorities restricted access from the beach Ponto in Casablanca to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and security reasons .
Giles mentioned that there are more than 135 shark species in that area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Retailer Sainsbury plans to strengthen its position on the market for beauty and fashion products in the UK
Sainsbury prices Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, making available areas with beauty products in the style of a universal store, with specialist sales assistants.
As part of a strengthening of the position on the market for beauty products in the United Kingdom, worth 2.8 billion pounds of sterling, which continues to grow, although domestic and fashion product sales are not on track, the larger regions with beauty products will be tested in 11 stores in the country and will be integrated into several stores next year, if they prove to be successful.
Investment in the beauty industry comes in the context where supermarkets are looking for a way to use the previous space for televisions, microwaves and household products.
The representatives of the Sainsbury retailer said that the number of beauty products they offer will be doubled by up to 3,000 products, including, for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing games, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also receive more space, with marked areas, similar to those in Boots stores.
The supermarket also relaunches its range of make-up products, Boutique, which means that most products are intended for vegan people, a demand that is increasingly met among young buyers.
In addition, the products of the French retailer The Fragrance Shop will be included in two Sainsbury chain stores for testing, the first being the open last week in Croydon, south of London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the second part of this year.
Online shopping and the tendency to buy smaller amounts of food every day from the nearest food store means that supermarkets need to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of the Sainsbury retailer, said that outlets will increasingly show up as universal stores, as supermarket chains are trying to fight big retail stores, Aldi and Lidl, which provide more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury has included both products from the Argos outlet in hundreds of stores and Habitats, since it purchased both chains two years ago, which means it recorded increases in food sales as well as increase in profit.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to re-propel the pharmaceutical and beauty compartments failed.
Sainsbury tried to merge with Boots in the early 2000s, but the negotiations stopped after a divergence on how Boots stores' revenues were shared in its supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury sold his pharmaceutical business including 281 stores, Celesio, which owned Lloyds Pharmacy chain for 125 million pounds three years ago.
This means that Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, adding a range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, retailer Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "I have transformed the aspect of our beautiful regions to improve the environment for our customers.
I have also invested in the specialized training of our colleagues, who will be available to offer you advice.
Our range of brands can be adapted to all needs, and the attractive environment and suitable locations transform us into an extraordinary location to buy beauty products, revolutionizing the old way of making purchases."
Peter Jones is angry after Holly Willoughby retired from a contract of 11 million pounds sterling
The TV star "Dragons' Den", Peter Jones, is angry after the TV presentation Holly Willoughby retired from a contract worth 11 million pounds of sterling with his life-style company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to get involved in their project on the True brand, which includes accessories and household items.
The couple's company was compared to the Goop brand, owned by Gwynet Paltrow.
This morning, 37-year-old broadcaster, told Instagram that he would retire.
Holly Willoughby generated Peter Jones' anger, the protagonist of the "Dragons' Den" show, retreating at the last moment from their business that offers life-style services to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was angry when one of the most beloved people on television admitted Tuesday, during a tense meeting at his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million pounds of sterling, no longer allow her to dedicate their brands, True, including accessories and household objects.
The company was compared to Gwynet Paltrow's Goop brand and almost doubled Willoughby's wealth, with an estimated 11 million pounds of sterling.
After Willoughby, 37 years old, announced Instagram that he would give up the contract for True, Jones left Britain to take refuge in one of his holiday homes.
A source statement: “Truly was far from one of Holly’s priorities.
She had to be her future in the long term for the next two decades.
The decision to withdraw shocked everyone.
No one came to believe what happened on Tuesday was less until the launch.
There is a full warehouse with products at Marlow headquarters that are ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of this morning's exhibition, which is one of Britain's best-selling sales, could harm the company millions, as a result of investments in products such as pillows and candles, clothing and household items, as well as the possible additional delay in launch.
It may also represent the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and Dan Baldwin, her husband, are ten-year-old friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby laid the foundations of the True brand together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52 years old, joined them as director in March.
Couples spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company's actions.
Willoughby will become the M&S ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as the host of the ITV's "I'm A Celebrity" show.
A close source of Jones said last night, "We don't want to comment on his business."
I was very hard, and then "I fell in love"
He made fun of the criticism he will receive from journalists because he made a comment that some would consider "requesting a president" and that he had such a positive attitude with regard to North Korean leaders.
Why did President Trump take such a big step back?
Trump said by imitating a voice of "representator of the news".
"I didn't take a step back."
He said Kim is interested in having another meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was described by Trump as a huge step towards denuclearising North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearisation have stopped.
Better than three months since the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea did not notice a "response" from the United States regarding the previous steps of North Korea's disarmament.
On the other hand, it noted that the United States continues to issue sanctions to put pressure on it.
Trump had a more optimistic point of view in his explanatory speech.
"All goes well with North Korea," he said.
"We had to go to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship."
He also said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: stopping rocket tests, supporting the release of hostages and the return of American troops.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to act like a president, but if I act like this, instead of the 10,000 people outside, who are trying to get into this unsuspecting arena, it would be around 200 people," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia have devastated an island, causing the death of hundreds of people
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organisations were told that their assistance was not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the population of the island of Lombok has been displaced, a national disaster has not been declared a necessary condition for launching aid actions at international level.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, it was very clear that I did not ask for international assistance, so it is a somewhat difficult situation," Sumbung said.
Although the Foundation "Save Children" is trying to form a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known whether foreign personnel are allowed to access the site.
Sutopo, spokesperson for the National Disaster Agency, said that the authorities of Indonesia are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to the aid efforts.
In view of the constant earthquakes suffered by Indonesia, it is unlikely that the country will continue to be prepared insufficiently for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not often found on other coasts.
It appears that the absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning was issued in this regard, could have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of circumstances, the journey between the islands of Indonesia proved to be a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate and more this.
A ship stationed in Lombok to deal with the victims of the earthquake is heading towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place where the new disaster occurred.
President Joko Widodo has proposed that the improvement of the poor infrastructure in Indonesia be the central point of his electoral campaign and has devoted money to roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has affected Joko's administration, which will take part in a new election campaign next year.
Joko also faces persistent pressure from the Indonesian sector, as members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes, as Christian and Muslim gangs have remained on the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other rudimentary weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool gives the lifesaver and equals the score in the game against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League in front of the Chelsea team, with a goal in 89 minutes on Saturday, at the London Stamford Bridge Football Stadium.
Sturridge got a walk from Xherdan Shaqiri, while it's about 30 meters from the gate of the adverse team, and his team was led by Chelsea with 1-0.
He hit the ball and sent it to the left before giving a shot in the direction of the gate.
The Mingea reached the top of which, heading toward the corner on the right top of the gate.
Eventually, the ball passed through Kepa Arizabalaga who jumped to her and fell into the gate.
"I should just try to get to the ideal position, get the ball, and players like Shaq always try to advance as much as possible, so I tried to get as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and it was enough, I didn't think very much about it, I just took the ball further."
Chelsea took a 1-0 break after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The blue team attacker sent the ball to Mateo Kovacic, and then returned to the middle of the field and ran to half of the Liverpool team's field.
Kovacic made a quick one-two move in the middle of the ground.
Then he sent the ball to Hazard, who entered.
Hazard exceeded the defense and sent the ball in place, managed to hit it with his left foot and pass through the player Alison Becker from Liverpool.
Liverpool will have a match against the Naples team in the leagues of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. at the Stadio Sao Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against the Videoton team in UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
The number of deaths caused by the tsunami in Indonesia reached 832
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, according to the National Disaster Agency, on Sunday morning.
Several people were caught under the ruins of the collapsed buildings with a magnitude of 7.5 that took place on Friday and triggered waves up to 6 meters, the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was covered by the remains caused by the collapse of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man, suspected of murdering a woman by stabbing
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The woman, 44 years old, was found at 7:55 a.m., with stab wounds at Grayson Mews, on John Street, and was arrested by a man suspected of murder.
The police asked the people in the area who heard or saw something about this subject to come to the statement section.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at the beginning stage, but I appeal to all the people near John Street in Birkenhead who have heard or seen something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who have registered any useful materials with the help of the room on board to contact us if they have essential information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the body belongs to a woman in Birkenhead and that it was found on a property.
This afternoon, a few people came to the crime scene who think I know a woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are under way, and the police have said they're trying to inform the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to return to his own apartment, but he was told by the police that no one is allowed to enter the building.
He was shocked when he found out what happened.
People living in the building were told it would take hours until they were allowed to enter.
A police officer told a person that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
In front of the place, there was a woman in tears.
Repeatedly "it's so terrible!".
At 2:00 p.m., two police dubs were in the perimeter and another one was outside.
Several police officers were in the perimeter, monitoring the apartment block.
Any person who has information is requested to send a direct message to the police @MerPolCC, to call 101 or to contact Crimestoppers anonymously at the phone number 0800 555 111 and to mention the case 247 of September 30.
Parliament's Cromwell's statue becomes the most recent commemorative monument affected by the "recording of history" changes
This removal would constitute a poetic justice for the destruction in the Taliban-style of such cultural and religious artifacts of England, carried out by its followers of fanatic Puritans.
But Cromwell described Jeremy Crick's suggestion as "a madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell, said: “It was inevitable in the debate on the removal of statues as Oliver Cromwell’s figure outside the Palace of Westminster to become a target.
The English Civil War Iconclass was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps a wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his grandmother Thomas of the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, carried out by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the story of a figure that many think deserves to celebrate.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as an advocate of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it is an exact representation, this is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
But surely the conflict since the middle of the 17th century has determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual figure, which is part of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector deserve also celebrated and celebrated."
A pig caused the death of a farmer from China
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local press agencies.
The man, identified only by the name of the family "Yuan", was found dead after being segregated an artery and was covered with blood, near a pig farm in the Lupanshu market in Guizhou province, according to the Sunday editor of Morning Post from South China.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject pig vaccines at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining Province of Qinghai, China.
It seems that he came with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby cottage was open.
He said there's a pig in the cage with a large-sized male with blood on his mouth.
Legal doctors confirmed that a pig of about 300 kg caused the farmer's death, according to the report.
"My cousin's feet were full of blood and cuts," said the cousin, whose family name is "Wu", for Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance cameras registered Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
After about an hour, his body was found.
The animal that caused the death of the man did not belong to Yuan, nor to his nephew.
A market representative told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent him from attacking someone else, while the police narrowed evidence from the crime scene.
It appears that the Yuan family and the authorities negotiate compensation for its death.
Although I'm rare, there have been reports of pigs attacking people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and their husband at their Massachusetts farm, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, because of a 300 kg pig, a man in the country of Gali was blocked in his tractor until his wife came to scare and take the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can trigger such reactions."
“Just play.
They like to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to pay them proper respect," he said.
The pink hurricane, which has lost its intensity, will cause torrential rains in the southwest of the United States
As expected, the Pink Hurricane loses its intensity as it moves to the coldest waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rains that will cause floods in the north of Mexico and in the south-west of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa records wind conditions at a speed of 85 km/h, being a Category 1 hurricane on Sunday, 5 a.m. and was located about 600 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to arrive in the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depressing zone has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean and is moving east, to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula, Monday, in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push the intense tropical humidity from the north to the south-west of the United States.
Monday, Rosa will bring precipitation up to 25 cm in some parts of Mexico.
Then the tropical humidity that will interact with the depressed area will generate abundant rains in the southwest in the following days.
Locally, precipitation between 3 and 10 cm will cause dangerous rapid floods, waste streams and possibly desert discharges.
The intense tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates of up to 5 and 8 cm per hour in certain areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation is expected between 5 and 10 cm in the south-west, especially in most of Arizona.
It is possible to have rapid floods due to the rapid deterioration conditions due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
It is not recommended to venture into the desert below, considering the threat represented by the tropical rain.
The strong rain may cause the canyons to turn into violent rivers, and the storms will bring local winds into reefs and dust.
The depressing zone that is approaching will bring torrential rains to the southern coast of California.
Precipitation of about 2 cm is possible, which could result in lower flows of leftovers and alleyways.
These will be the first precipitation in the region in the wet season.
The scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona on the second part of Sunday and on the first part of the day of the month, before the rain spread more months evening and Tuesday.
The intense precipitation will spread in so-called "four corners" Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
In October there will be intense temperature changes in the US, as the Arctic region will become colder, but the tropicals remain rather warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature at short distances.
On Sunday, dramatic temperature differences are encountered at the U.S. level.
There is a temperature difference of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the extended heat of the summer will try to form and expand again.
It is expected that a large part of the central and eastern US will face a warm start of October, with temperatures of up to 27 degrees in the extended areas, from the southern fields to certain portions of the north-east.
Tuesday, New York City could reach 27 degrees, with about 4 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates high average temperatures for the US east until the first half of October.
Over 20 million people followed Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people followed the press statement supported by the candidate at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of a sexual attack that was supposed to take place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
At the same time, political confrontation continued, TV stations interrupting the normal Friday program for a last-hour news: an agreement between Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona to the FBI to investigate the charges for a week.
Ford told the board of judges that he was 100% certain that Kavanaugh had harassed her while she was in a state of drunkenness and that he tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an intense confession, said it's 100% sure this didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people would have followed the hearing on Friday.
The company included average vision on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that transmitted it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen tends to have trouble contouring people who see from the office.
To put this into perspective, this audience is similar to that for a football game in play-off or with the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported the designation of Kavanaugh, was in front of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the daily hearing.
ABC was in second place, with a number of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS was followed by 3.1 million people, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest remained at a high level after hearing.
Flake was at the center of the drama on Friday.
After the Office of the Moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by the CNN and CBS chambers on Friday morning while protesters were shouting at him and he was trying to climb up to a meeting of the Judicial Committee.
He was looking down for a few minutes while people were arguing about it, and everything was broadcast live to CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling us the truth?
It was said to him, "You are powerful, while so many women are weak."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said, before closing the elevator, that he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
Televisions later broadcast a direct vote within the Judicial Committee to advance the nomination of Kavanaugh for the Senate vote.
But Flake said he would do this only if the FBI agreed to analyse the charges against the nominee next week, which is a matter for minority democracies.
Flake was largely convinced of conversations with his friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with Coons and several senators after that.
Flake's election was an important one, obviously the Republicans would not have the votes necessary to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister charges criticism of "political games" about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political games" with the future of Britain and undermine national interests in an interview for Sunday Times.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, participated in the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to the accompanying photo on the first page of the paper, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued an attack on his plan for Brexit, the so-called Chequers plan, saying the proposal that the UK and the European Union collect their reciprocal tariffs was "a ridiculous one".
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police arrest Diteon Simpson, suspected to have shot the LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the case of the death of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player, at the age of 20.
Diteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and imprisoned, being charged with murder of grade 2 according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities published a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during his stay.
Police recovered glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, CBS affiliate.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police say he admitted that he shot Wayde dead.
His claim was set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The Baton Rouge Legal Medicine Bureau published a preliminary report on Friday, saying that death was caused by a head-to-head shot through the neck.
The department is responsible for the Louisiana police force, the state police lab, the South University police force and the citizens of the area, for the aid offered in the investigation, which led to the arrest.
Athletic Director LSU, Joe Aleva, thanked the police for "diligentness and the pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The attacker with a height of 1.98 m grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, played basketball for LSU.
Last season, it scored on average 5,6 points and had 2,6 recoveries.
On Friday morning, coach of the LSU basketball team, Will Wade, said the team is "damaged" and "shocked" by the death of Wayde.
"This worries me all the time," Wade said.
A volcano threw a pillar of ashes over the city of Mexico City
The Cenusa from the Volcano Popocatepetl arrived in the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to keep their distance from the volcano after starting their activities in the crater and 183 gas and ashes emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The centre monitors several thefts and vibrations.
The images of socialization networks showed layers of ash on the car parks in the neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
The geophysicists observed an increase in the volcanic activity at 72 km south-east of the capital, after a 7.1 earthquake struck the centre of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Merger between police and Catalan separatists prior to the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after protestors pro-independent continued with the gendarmeries, at the first anniversary of the vote for the Catalonian secession, reaching out to thousands of opposition demonstrators.
A group of pro-separatists masked away from the gandarmies bombed them with eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that were usually flooded by tourists.
The intensification was subsequently intensified by the police using their batons to control the situation.
For a few hours, the pro-independence groups called out "We don't forget, we don't forgive," while the Union Protestants called out "Living Spain!".
14 people received medical care for minor injuries caused during protests, according to local press.
The tensions remain at a high level in the region that wants to become independent one year after the 1 October referendum was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters have chosen, in a overwhelming majority, to become independent, although voting has been low, and those against the session have mostly boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 100 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region, with violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped over Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but Protestants were forced to choose a new path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope in gaining independence from Catalonia.
“Last year I lived some of the most beautiful moments in my life.
I looked at my parents crying for joy that I can vote, but now we have nothing to do," he said.
Despite the achievement of a vital but narrow victory in the December regional elections last year, the pro-independent Catalan parties tried to maintain this year's advancement, many of the most famous leaders are either in exile themselves or in detention, awaiting the trial for the role they had in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who registered the protest on his phone in support of the police, said politicians on both sides fueled the conflict.
"The situation is getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison since the end of last year, announced that he will run for elections to the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for European elections, it is the best way to denounce regression in democratic values and the repression I've seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: More men were arrested after they got in with the car in a house
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after a car entered a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident took place on Thursday, about 19:30, in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said they were damaged at the port level and even at the building.
It seems that at a given time a jet was used against the car.
Menga's hit helped the Livingston team win with 1-0 in front of the Rangers team
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston left the Rangers team unreplicated, Steven Gerrard reaching the second match in 18 matches, as the manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's hit turned out to make a difference while Gary Holt's team played the same level as Hibernian in the second round.
Gerrard's team remains without a win in the Premier League this season and faces the Hearts leaders, behind them with eight points, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers hosts Rapid Vienna in Europe League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston continues unbeatable in the division up to six matches, Holt's chief coach still feels the taste of defeat, as he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses its chance against high visitors
Holt's team should've gone ahead a long time before they signed up, and their orientation caused all kinds of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to penetrate and try to land on the port space, and then Alan Lithgow managed to land wide after he went in by sneaking into intercepting the ball sent with Craig Halkett's head.
The lodges were pleased to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could make trouble for visitors at free kicks.
And this was the way the crucial void came.
Rangers accepted a free shot, and Livingston managed to open up, Declan Gallagher and Robinson working to care for Menga, who shot and marked out of the center.
At that stage, Rangers dominated the property, but faced the impenetrable defense of the host, and the porter Liam Kelly was no longer in trouble with the rest of the game.
This game model continued in the second time, although Alfredo Morelos forced a defense from Kelly.
Scott Pittman did not succeed against Allan McGregor from Rangers, and Lithgow gave a big hit from another Livingston team player.
The diagonal steps continued to be in which the Livingston team, but unsuccessfully, and the two requests for penalties - after Halkett rushed Glenn Middleton and after a plot - were not accepted.
"Fenomenal game" offered by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena stadium
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingstone.
They were excellent, without exception, continuing to exceed expectations on an ascending path.
Their game style and team have not changed since they got back to the top, but the merits have to be given to Holt for the way he trained his team since he took it.
He had so many models to follow.
Captain Halkett was great, with an excellent organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worall in difficulty throughout the party.
But the Rangers weren't too inspired.
Although they've had good performance since they were led by Gerrard, they haven't reached the same standards.
The empty steps were unsuccessful, they managed once to catch the door of free opponents, and this should be an alarm signal for Rangers, which is in the middle of the class.
Joint reactions on Erdogan’s visit to Cologne
It was all pink Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to remedy relations between NATO alliances.
These are unhappy about problems such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
In this context, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world, outside Turkey.
The police called for security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from reaching the mosque, but quite a number of supporters gathered near to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan, the majority of the Kurds, heard their voice, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to receive it with open arms in the country.
The contradiction protests reflect the division in respect of a visitor considered a hero of some of the Turks in Germany and an autocrat of others.
Road accident in Deptford: a biker dies following a collision with a car
A biker died after a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place at the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The car driver stopped, and the paramedics showed up at the scene, but the man died in front of the place.
The accident took place only a few months after another biker died following an accident that took place on Children Street, where the driver ran from the front of the place, which is about a mile from the place where the accident happened on Saturday.
Metro police said officers are trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Access is restricted in that area, the bus route is diverted, and motorcyclists are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers injured following a siege
Six prison officers were injured as a result of a stay in a high-security prison for men, a prison representative said.
On Sunday, a continuation of HMP Long Martin from Worcestershire was launched at about 9:30, this being underway.
Specialized officers have been brought in to take care of the maintenance, in which eight detainees are involved, isolated in a wing.
Officers were treated in front of the site for minor injuries to the front.
A spokesperson for the prison said: “The assistance of the prison staff was requested to deal with an incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received medical care after they were injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have very clear rules on those responsible, who will be transferred to the police and could spend a longer period of time after the gratis."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 detainees, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor needed hospital treatment after being attacked by a detainee.
And last October, officials dealing with disturbances were called to prison to deal with a very serious situation, while staff were attacked with billiards.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are in danger of being flooded because of the pink hurricane (the drought zones can enjoy benefits as a result of this)
It is rare to experience tropical depression in Arizona, but this is quite likely to happen at the beginning of next week, because the remaining energy resources of the Rosa hurricane will be used in the southwest desert, presenting a risk of rapid flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued rapid flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in the western area of Arizona, south and east of Nevada, south-east of California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to have a direct route to Phoenix on Tuesday, and will cause precipitation on the second day of the month.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service announced in a Twitter message that only "ten tropical cycles have maintained a tropical storm or depression at a distance of about 320 km from Phoenix in 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane with action at a distance of approximately 60 km across the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Centre for Urbane predict precipitation between 5 and 10 cm, with quantities isolated up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim from Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest desert, including in the centre of the Stancoshi Mountains and the Great Basin, there will be recorded quantities between 3 and 5 cm, with possible total quantities up to 10 cm in isolated areas.
For regions outside the risk of rapid flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing, given that the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, in certain areas the torrential rain will be beneficial, as the southwest is facing drought problems.
According to the U.S. Secetary Monitor, less than 40% of Arizona faces at least a severe drought, namely the second largest category", information found on weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will lead to land runoffs on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, who still has the power of hurricane in the morning of Sunday, with a wind up to 136 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north, with 19 km per hour.
Furtuna will meet colder waters in the Pacific and will therefore decrease.
Thus, it is expected that it will produce landfills in Mexico, with a tropical storm power in the afternoon or the evening of the month.
The torrential rains in Mexico could be significant, presenting a high flood risk.
"There are expected torrential rains between 8 and 10 cm" from Baja California to the northwest of Sonore, and can also reach 25 cm", according to weather.com.
Then, Rosa will head north, in Mexico, as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the morning of Tuesday, as a tropical depression, passing through Arizona and reaching south Utah on the night of Tuesday.
"The dangerous principle represented by Rosa or its remains is the extreme torrential rain in Baja California, the north-west of Sonor and the desert in the south-west of the United States," said a representative of the National Centre for Urbane.
It is expected that these rains will produce sudden floods, which will endanger people's lives, and will bring streams of waste in deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three adolescents and a 20-year-old man were arrested as a result of a suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with injuries caused by stabbing in Somerset.
The adolescent was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 04:00.
He was taken to the hospital, where he's in a stable state.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested tonight in the Radstock area, according to the Avon and Somerset police.
Officers have asked for help from citizens who could have material on their mobile phone, respectively, to appear at the police station.
Trump said Kavanaugh faced the "disillusion and pride" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump further stated that Kavanaugh faced "the disillusionment and pride" of the Democratic Party during its nomination.
Thursday, Kavanaugh testified in front of the Congress, strongly rejecting Christine Blasey Ford's allegations regarding sexual harassment ten years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her statement.
The president said Saturday that "the American people saw Kavanaugh's genius, quality and courage" on that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best minds in this generation's legal field," he said to many supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred directly to the nomination of Kavanaugh as speaking about the importance of the Republican presence in the interim elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our life.
I'm not running, but in a way, I'm running," he said.
"For this reason, I express my overall positive opinion of the candidates that I consider to be outstanding."
Trump argued that the democracies are in a mission to "resist and obstruct".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate since the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place late Friday, a GOP leader for the CNN said.
Hundreds of people killed by the earthquake in Indonesia, the number increasing
At least 384 people were killed, many of them being taken by huge waves that hit the beaches, when a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people flocked to a beach festival on Friday in Palu, when waves with a height of six meters hit the beach at amurg, people being taken by water and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-degree earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat was issued yesterday, people still saw their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, becoming such victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman of the GNPB disaster alleviation agency, said at a Jakarta press conference.
"The tsunami brought with it cars, bushes, houses, hitting everything on the dry ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled far with a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the country.
He added that some people had to climb the trees to escape the tsunamis and survive.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The photographs published by the disaster agency present a number of buildings and destroyed warehouses, turned and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the replicas continued to shake the city on the coast.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesia Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy emitted by the strong Friday earthquake was approximately 200 times greater than the power of the second World War Hiroshima nuclear bomb.
The geographical structure of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow golf course, is likely to increase the extent of the tsunami, added this representative.
Nugroho described the damage as being "extended" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of the collapsed buildings, he said, in addition to the 540 injured and 29 missing persons.
Nugroho said that the victims and casualties could be larger along the coast of 300 km north of Palu, an area called Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
The communications were "completely disturbed, without any information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," said the Red Cross, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
He added: "This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Saturday, the agency was severely criticised because it did not inform about the fact that a tsunami would strike Palu, although the authorities said the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In the positions of socialization networks, you can hear a man on the top of a building shouting bellows that the tsunami is approaching people from the adjacent street.
In a few minutes, a wall of water hits the ground, taking this building and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a major break in electricity, which has blocked communications in Palu, making it difficult to coordinate the authorities' rescue efforts.
The army began sending freight planes to Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but the evacuated people still need food and other basic things.
The city airport has been reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned a visit to the Palu evacuation centres for Sunday.
The number of deaths caused by the tsunami in Indonesia is 800.
The situation is extremely serious.
While the Word Vision staff from Dongala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where the employees are housed in improvised warehouses in the court of the office, they passed the devastating scenes, Doseba said.
She added: "They told me they saw many houses destroyed."
The situation is very serious.
Even if the aid groups began to take action in the event of disaster, some people complained that foreign workers with comprehensive expertise had been prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to the regulations of Indonesia, financial resources, supplies of materials and personnel can only reach the site of a disaster if a national disaster zone is declared.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the province level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"After the government says, 'Yes, this is a national disaster', we can start international assistance actions, but nothing has been announced yet."
After the second night of the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday in Palu, friends and families of the missing hoped that the loved ones would be miraculously saved from such a national disaster.
Saturday, a boy was pulled out of a channel.
On Sunday, rescue personnel released a woman under the ruins of two days, with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandoro, coach of the national paragliding team, trained for the Asian Games, which ended early this month in Indonesia, two of the missing paragliding pilots.
Other prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"In view of the experience in paraphant activity, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon told how, a few hours after the news about the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the community of sports practitioners with paranata, he sent desperate messages on WhatsApp to the Palu competitors who participated in the festival organized on the beach.
But in his right message only a gray biffee appeared, and not two blue biffees.
"I think that means that the messages have not been transmitted," he said.
A group of thieves stole $26,750 while feeding a Newport banker on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who feeds a ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The car driver emptied a ATM from the entertainment complex and was preparing to carry more money, Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While busy, another man "run behind the employee Brink" and stole a bag of money to be carried.
According to the report, several suspects fled the scene, but the police did not mention the number of people involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identity is requested to contact the Newport police on the telephone number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes the name of the scene to "Ye"
Rapper Kanye West changes the name of the scene to "Ye".
It made a Saturday announcement about the change on Twitter: "the official known as Kanye West".
West, aged 41, is called "Ye" for a while and uses this title as the title of the eighth album, released in June.
This change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
It comes to an issue in place of the Ariana Grande song, which cancelled "for emotional reasons", the emission producer mentioned.
In addition to the fact that it is an abbreviation of the current name of the scene, West said earlier that this word has also a religious significance for it.
"I think "yes" is the most commonly met word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West at the beginning of this year, in the discussion about the title of the album with Big Boy radio host.
“So I am you, I am us, it is about us.
It all started with "Kanye", which means the only one, and it got to "Ye", which is a reflection of our good, bad, negative things and everything.
The album is more a reflection on what we are as people."
He's one of the many rappers who have chosen to change his name.
Sean Combs had countless stage names, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
And a former West's collaborator, JAY-Z, changed his name, sometimes with critique, sometimes without, and also with big letters.
Mexico's President promises not to use military forces against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised he will never use military forces against civilians, once near the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody retribution against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "will never use the army to suppress the Mexican people".
The troops fired a peaceful demonstration from the market on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when left-wing movements of students were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has committed himself to supporting Mexican youth by granting monthly grants to students and opening several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding for IA
While China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, the investor and user of artificial intelligence, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come as soon as several US government members have made announcements about IA, even if there is no official strategy for artificial intelligence in the US.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it proposes to be the first in terms of innovation IA by 2030.
"Dublining the IA research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are much more behind the US and that we are looking for the next IA discovery," Lee said.
The duplication of funds could double the chances that the next major implementation in the field of IA will be made in the US, Lee told the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "Superpowers IA: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, which invested in one of China's most prominent companies, Face++.
In 1980, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an IA system that beat American player Othello, being the best in the field at that time, and later was executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch of China.
Lee appreciated the previous competitions of American governments in the field of technology, such as Robotics Challenge of the Agency's advanced defence research projects, and asked when it would be next, to help identify the following visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government funds, Lee said.
"China doesn't put drinks in the hands of academic leaders, but corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired remarkable graduates from universities to work at IA in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could help the US intensify its IA efforts.
"I think it should be offered automatically to doctors in IA," he said.
The State Council of China issued a Development Plan for the New Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides financial support to people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations provide money for researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic activity is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of the year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence to involve partners in the field and academics, and the White House announced the formation of a Selection Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
This month, the U.S. Army Research Institute (DARPA) announced an investment worth $2 billion for an initiative called "AI Next".
NSF is also currently investing over $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, there have been no changes in US legislation aimed at establishing a National Security Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians will vote in referendum if they want to change the name of the country
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum if they wish the country's name to be changed to "North Macedonia", a change that would resolve an old dispute for a decade with Greece, which opposed its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes a province called Macedonia, argues that the name of the neighbouring country is a claim on its territory and has opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Macedonian slave majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign has cast doubt on the presence of the vote, and it is possible not to reach the minimum limit of 50% necessary for validating the referendum.
The question on the referendum ballot will be: "Do you agree with joining the EU and NATO, accepting the agreement with Greece?".
The name change supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that it is a price to be paid by Macedonia, one of the countries that resulted from the displacement of Yugoslavia, in order to be accepted in entities such as the EU and NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, so that young people in Macedonia can live free under the shadow of the European Union, because this means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, many Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds quorum is needed in Parliament.
The state's electoral commission stated that no irregularities were reported until 13:00.
However, participation was only 16%, compared with 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of the people with the right to vote voted.
"I came to vote for my children and our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62-year-old, a voters from Skopje, the capital of the country.
On 30 September 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and their son, Dushko, voted for the referendum on the renaming of Macedonia, which will allow them to join NATO and join the European Union.
In front of the Skopje parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, at 54 years of age, prepared a scene of small dimensions and pulled chairs in front of the courts raised by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with the front, not on the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not wanted by the name of Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev said joining NATO will bring the necessary investments in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I think the majority will be in favour of the change of name, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of joining NATO and the EU," Zaev said after voting.
He said a result in the name change would be "confirming our future".
According to a poll published last month by the Policy Research Institute, between 30% and 43% of citizens with voting rights will participate in the referendum, among the necessary participants.
According to another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Among these, 70% said they would vote in favour of change.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the vote must be of 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious hit at the policy level of the pro-western government since the government was taken over in May last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City manages to pass through the entire Brigton team defensive and march a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to pass through Brigton's defense team and win the Manchester City 2-0 team on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed that Aguero was incredibly easy to march in 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a step in the middle of the ground at the beginning of the sequence.
He moved very quickly among the three defensive players from Brighton before reaching the free part of the land.
Then, Aguero woke up surrounded by four players of the opposing team.
He managed to get through a defense, and then he exceeded several enemy players on the edge of which the Brighton team.
After that, he took a walk to the left, the balloon coming to Sterling.
The English attacker sent the balloon back to Aguero, who hit the ball with his right foot, and managed to avoid the porter at Brighton, Matthew Ryan, with a shot at the right side of the port.
"Aguero faces a few problems on his feet," told reporters Pep Guardiola, the manager of the Manchester City team.
“I talked to him and agreed to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he wrote a blank at the time."
But Sterling is the one who got their initial advantage for Azuri in the Premier League game.
The goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a step deep on Brighton's territory at that stage.
Then he gave Leroy Sane his left flank.
Sane blew the balloon a few times until she sent a pass to Sterling, who sent it to the gate.
The Azuri attacker hit the balloon to the ground right before heading outside the ground.
Manchester City will meet with Hoffenheim in the group phase on Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany on Tuesday at 12:55.
Scherzer wants to make a fuss against Rockies.
With the national team removed from the game in play-off, there were not too many reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win the game on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies team, but only if there are still implications in the play-off for Rockies, which holds an advantage with a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
Rockies got at least an unpredictable place, with a victory of 5-2 against the national team on Friday night, but still trying to keep his first division title.
“Even if we don’t play for nothing, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere here, from Denver, along with the crowd, and the other team would probably play at the highest level at any point where I could face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in these circumstances?"
The national team has not yet announced the player who will open the game on Sunday, but according to the sources, is inclined to let Scherzer give the first shot in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be hitting the opening game with number 34, had a heat session on Thursday and will throw in normal conditions this Sunday.
The Washington middle house has a score of 18-7 and an ERA of 2.53 and 300 ratings in 220 and 2/3 matches this season.
Trump expresses his support in West Virginia
The President referred to the situation regarding a decision by the Supreme Court regarding Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of the Republican presence in the interim elections.
“All our efforts are at stake in November.
There are five more weeks to one of the most important choices in our life.
This is one of the big ones, I'm not running, but I'm actually running, so I'm trying to make good candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, radical group of democrats, you see what is happening right now.
And they are determined to take power again by using whatever means are necessary, you can see their evil.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control, that's what they want, to have power and control, and we won't give it."
He also said that democracies are in a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"And you can see this in the last four days," he said, describing democrats as "fragile and evil, naughty and false."
He referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Democratic Party and who is part of the Senate Judicial Committee, which was strongly killed by the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you disclose the document?
What?
No. Hmm... I... wait a minute – that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer tolerates people from a different perspective.
People who express their opinion are no longer tolerated
It didn't surprise me that Momentum activists from my local party supported the motion of censorship with regard to me.
Finally, I am only one of the members of the Labour Party of Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome, just because we have expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my colleague in Parliament, received a similar treatment, as she was very much involved in anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, the motion of censorship was a criticism of my address that I did not agree with what Jeremy Corbyn said.
As regards the importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar problems, ironically, about which Jeremy did not share his views with previous leaders.
The announcement for the Friday session in Nottingham East of the Labour Party mentions that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Much of the eight-year period as a member of Parliament for the Labour Party, the GC meetings on Friday evening were so.
Unfortunately, today many meetings do not take place in this way, and the promise of a "better, smoother" political environment has been forgotten for a long time, if ever respected.
It has become increasingly evident that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of what is accepted by the Party's leadership.
Things started to be like this when Jeremy became a leader, when I noticed that some colleagues with whom I had a common vision about politics began to expect me to change my thinking and agree with some things I had previously disagreed with, including national security or the EU's single market.
Every time I speak in public, no matter what I say, there is a wave of abuses on the de-socialization networks that demand my removal from the party, complaining about the central policy, telling me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only person who faces this.
Indeed, I know that I am happier than my colleagues because the comments about my person tend to be of a political nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexual or racist abuse, but maintain their level of involvement in this regard.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse has become a normal thing.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different views within the party, and with every move of censorship or change of the selection rules, the party becomes increasingly less flexible in this regard.
Many people have recommended that I put my head down in the last two years, not being so loud anymore, and everything "will be fine" like this.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, when I was a student, motivated by the negligence that the Thatcher government has shown has led to my class collapse, I wanted to fight for improved public services for those who need them the most, as a local councillor or minister.
I've never hidden my political opinions, including in my last election.
No person in Nottingham East can say that my opinions on politics and aspects that I disagree with in relation to current management are unclear.
I can only say to the people who supported the motion on Friday that, in the context of the country heading towards Brexit, what will affect our local households, businesses and services, I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
However, the only message I want to convey is not for the Momentum in Nottingham group, but for citizens, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to represent you and promise you that no threat of the removal from the party or political opportunism will stop me from making the decisions that you consider to be in your best interest.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Air football team reaches the top of the class
Despite the fact that two late trials have influenced in some way the final result, there is no doubt that Air deserves to win the extremely interactive game today in Tennent's Premiership.
He's in the top of the class now, being the only team without any defeat from the ten.
Finally, everything was summed up in their best defense, as well as in their more chance-taking experience, which helped the host team and thanked coach Peter Murchie.
"We have been subjected to more tests during our games so far and we continue to be innocent, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "The merit is given to the Air team, they have had more opportunities than we have."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute trial, transformed by Frazier Climo, gave him an advantage to the Air team, but a yellow card received by Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was able to join the team, playing at Warriors, allowed the Melrose team to change the score, and Jason Baggot benefited from an unprocessed attempt.
Climo got a penalty for Air and, even in the middle of the game, managed to sign up, and then managed to transform an individual trial, and the score was 17-5 for Air for a break.
But Melrose started the second round very well, and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the margin to five points.
The game was suspended for a few minutes because of Ruarid Knott's serious injury, which was taken out of the field with a mark, and from the start of the game, Ayr was disillusioned by the trial of Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Captain Air team Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and again, Melrose team made the spare player pay with an unprocessed attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of a full pressure.
However, the host team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card because he liked Climo without balls, MacPherson managed to walk, offering him the advantage of the Air team.
Climo turned the trial, as he did again almost from the start of the game, after Kyle Rowe had run a "box kick" move and sent the extreme Gregor Henry deep for the fifth attempt of the host team.
The view of the "Still Game" sitcom is prepared for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, the viewer of the Still Game sitcom, seems ready to move into the hospitality industry after he learned that he was appointed director of a restaurant company.
The man, 56 years old, plays Jack Jarvis' role in the BBC's beloved show, writing his script and playing with his long-time partner, comedy actor Greg Hemfill.
The two announced that the next series, the one with the new number, will be the last, and it seems that Kieman is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the information in the official register, he is the director of Arifingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan wants to be involved in the "industry in the development of restaurants".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
Marines patrol a shipyard full of macarans in La Paz.
Public buildings build the blue flag, like the ocean.
The ship bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with the motto: "The sea is our right.
We have to get her back."
Along Bolivia, which has no way out of the sea, the memory of a coast lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century is still alive – just as the desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are likely to be at the highest level in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the necessary advantage, a spirit of unity and senity and, of course, awaits the result with a positive vision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow ICJ's decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will give a ruling in favor of Bolivia's claim and that, after decades of hard discussions, Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign exit to the sea, Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia – who faces a controversial struggle for the next year’s realisation – also has much to gain from the decision of the months.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts think it's unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and that there would be too little change if it happened.
The United Nations organisation within the Netherlands has no power to grant the territory belonging to Chile and has provided that it will not determine the outcome of the possible discussions.
The fact that the ICJ decision comes only six months after final appeals have been heard indicates that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And not only did Bolivia not succeed, but it's possible for the last four years to give it back.
"The problem of access to the sea has been reversed by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric weakened any Chilean residual goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at a given time, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was unheard of quickly.
The Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end the 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – another of the most beloved presidents in Latin America – used the maritime problem as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we must pass through the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not take place if the United States cannot trust it
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea's Foreign Minister, said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it couldn't trust Washington.
Ri talked about this Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He asked the United States to respect the promises made during a Singapore summit with rival leaders.
His comments come in the context in which US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to resume diplomatic actions on nuclear threat after more than three months from the meeting with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it is an "irreal vision" as the continued sanctions and the U.S. objection to the declaration concerning the end of the Korean war to ever make the Northern Territory surrender.
Washington has reservations to agree with the statement without the Phenian taking significant disarmament measures first.
Both Kim and the president of the United States, Donald Trump, want a second summit.
But there are a lot of skeptics who don't think that the Phenian has serious intentions to give up the arsenal the country considers the only way to ensure his safety.
Pompeo intends to visit the Phenian next month to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion presentation from Paris presents the latest trends in hats and will be available in stores soon
If you are looking for blankets to extend your collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you no longer need to seek.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne shocked participants at the Paris Fashion Week, launching a series of oversized and extravagant carpets for their spring-summer 2019 collection.
Practical coatings have won the Instagram platform this summer, and fashion designers have sent the creations that steal eyes on the podium.
The resistance part of the creation, made by Valentino, was an extravagant, bej-colored hat with a wide edge, like a penis, in which the heads of the models melted.
Other oversized accessories included peaches decorated with marbles, a magic hat and even a pineapple, but they are not created to protect your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre mice, on time for Halloween.
Many of the colored bowls had cut lips and brought more of the accessories selected by Hannibal Lecter, and did not wear high heels.
One of the creatures seemed to be a sinking equipment, having an oxygen tube and glasses, while the other seemed to be an ice-cream cone.
And if you want to continue to adopt such a dress style, with oversized clothing items, you are lucky.
Stylists suggest a return of huge vouchers to luxury fashion stores.
The above-sized roofs come back after the appearance of the “La Bomba” hat, the straw hat with a wide edge, seen all over the world, from Rihanna and to Emily Ratajkowski.
The return of the no-practice hat that appeared on all socialisation networks has caused the appearance of another super-sized creature on the podium, namely the paiety for the beach, with a size as large as the bathroom model that wears it.
Orange bag of raffie, with raffie straps and a white leather handle, was the resistance part of the Spring-Summer 2019 collection "La Riviera" of Jacquemus at the Fashion Week of Paris
Stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see oversized decks and beach people in luxury stores next summer, because the fashion designer had such a strong impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Linguistic skills, essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results for examinations, which is supported by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With over 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), are trying to provide services at the highest level for their students and parents.
Independent schools propose to prepare their students for high school and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a special school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, your words will reach his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, words will reach his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's competition, we note that foreign languages are at the top of the classes, with the highest promotion rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who have studied foreign languages have obtained a Higher Grade A certificate.
Data collected from 74 SCIS school members showed that 72% of students obtained a Higher Grade A certificate in Mandarin; 72% of those who study German, 69% of those who study French and 63% of those who study Spanish obtained such a certificate.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Now, foreign languages, such as matter, are held in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and in other fields.
A survey carried out by the British Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that for the reasons why employers gave them to fight for job vacancies, 17% had been attributed to a lack of linguistic skills.
As a result, more and more language skills become imperative for young people to prepare for their future career.
With more opportunities for jobs that require foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career that someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, having such a ability throughout their lives.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person before the competition.
According to a survey by YouTube on over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to carry on a conversation, and the French language was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
Therefore, investment in learning foreign languages is important for children today.
With more languages, especially in developing countries, children will have greater opportunities to find significant jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach other foreign languages.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will learn languages that are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be more languages of choice in independent schools, with teaching frameworks that are specialized in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and encourage them with the skills necessary to succeed, no matter what the future may be.
It cannot at this point be denied, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital for the future of the country, so that this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron will make the debut at Lakers Sunday, in San Diego
Expectation is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James debut for Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James will play in opening Sunday's press release against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes will the game remain to be established.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, wrote on Twitter that James will probably play a few minutes.
Following the training from the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for the six-game Lakers program in the press.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pressure games to prepare," he said.
Time of Trump's election meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five meetings scheduled next week, which include stops in places where the electorate is favourable to him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote of confirmation for the candidate elected by him for the free place of the Supreme Court is suspended temporarily, Trump wants to strengthen support for future elections in the middle of the mandate, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump's election meeting take place in West Virginia tonight and where can I track him online?
The meeting of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00, East Coast hour, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow Trump's election meeting online from West Virginia through live video stream below on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will discuss Brett Kavanaugh's hearing this week, a candidate at the Supreme Court, hearing that has become strained due to allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior, while the Senate's expected vote of confirmation is suspended for a week, in order for the FBI to investigate the charges.
But the main objective of this series of meetings is to help Republicans, who face hard elections in November, to win some land.
Thus, President Trump's campaign stated that the role of these five meetings next week is "energizing volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority held in the Senate and in the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important for its programme that the president will travel as many states as possible before entering the very crowded campaign season," a spokesman for Trump's campaign, who did not want to be appointed, told Reuters.
Programmed to take place in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's meeting could attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be presented in the Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won the elections at a difference of more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is being investigated.
"The fact that the president came to try to push him into the poll is not a good sign for Morrisey," said Simon Haeder, a politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder 2018 Cup: US team gives determination and continues to fight to keep the chance for simple tests that start Sunday
After three well-dominated sessions, it is possible that Saturday's foursome trial afternoon was exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The always oscillating pendulum of motivation is a concept invented for the world of sports, but players really believe in it, so much more in competitions like this.
So where is their motivation now?
"They were driving us with six points, now the difference is only four points, so we are based on this decline for a little reason," Jordan Speith said at the end of the day.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with a four-point advance, when there are still twelve points at stake.
Americans, says Spieth, feel that the game begins to change in their favor and that there are enough reasons for encouragement, of which the most important is the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and have won every three of the four points.
Spieth sent the rings to the green area with a fatal precision, being an example for his colleagues.
Those festive goggles became more and more noisy as they ran ahead, especially when they recorded a crucial point through which they evened the score in the fourth match, after he and Thomas had been driven with two points after the first two holes.
The hit that won the 15 match was celebrated with a similar hurlet, a hurlet that makes you think the American team still has a chance.
"You just have to concentrate and worry only about your own game," Spieth says.
That's all these players left.
18 holes to leave a good impression.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple of Europe has won four of the four matches and it seems I can't make a mistake.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't need any additional hits Saturday afternoon, but this statement is valid both for Saturday mornings, and for Friday afternoons, even for the nine points of Friday mornings.
This performance and how their energy seems to flow towards and from the enthusiastic audience reinforces the view that they will be the most dangerous players on Sunday. No other player would be more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari if they would eventually lead to a potential victory of the Europeans when the sun comes over Le Golf National.
Preferably, both at the same time, at different holes.
The debate on the glory of the Europeans remains premature, now.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson passed quickly by Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning at the fourballs test, when he made couples with Alex Noren.
An additional blow and two doubles at the first nine holes sunk Spanish and Swedish into a pit so deep that they were not even near to get out of it.
Sunday, however, no one will be safe.
The fourballs and foursomes are fascinating and deserve to be followed almost because of the interactions between pairs, data and data advice and how a strategy can be changed on-the-spot.
Europeans have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage in the final day, but this foursome session has shown and that the US team has reason to continue fighting, which some, especially those in the United States, have doubted.
Europe leads with 10-6 in the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe begins the last day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage after completing the fourballs and Saturday's foursomes with an advantage of 10-6 in front of the United States.
The inspired pairs composed of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led offensively with two victories in front of an exhilarating Tiger Woods, which has so far increased their score to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to regain the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated American players who made many mistakes in the morning's fourballs trial and won the 3 to 1.
The US opposed a more serious resistance to the foursome test, where it won two matches, but could not reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points out of the 12 simple Sunday matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European news that wins four points in a row, and together with Molinari, a pair called "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair that wins four points of the four opening matches throughout the history of the Ryder Cup.
After they smashed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs trial, they super-supported to defeat the brave Woods and the American newsmen Bryson Dechambeau with an even clearer score, 5-4.
Woods, who had problems in the two games on Saturday, had occasional genius clips, but so far he lost 19 of the 29 matches at fourballs and foursomes, of which seven were successive defeats.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning fourballs session, returned with partner Henrik Stenson to the foursome test and beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, positions one and three in the world.
Europe did not, however, have an unimpeded journey on this pleasant and cool day in southwestern Paris.
Jordan Spieth, a triple major tournament winner, and Justin Thomas became the benchmark for Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They managed to win with 2-1 a match against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs test, then returned later and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4 to 3 in the foursome test, after they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team managed to recover a four-point deficit in simple trials, although, because they are the current trophies, Furyk's players only need an equal result.
However, after they were in place for the second two days in a row, a Sunday counterattack seems unlikely.
North Korea states that there is no "no chance" of unilateral disarmament as long as there is no confidence
The Foreign Minister of North Korea said on Saturday to the United Nations that extending sanctions would deepen mistrust in the United States and that it is impossible for his country to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the Global Council that in North Korea, "significant measures have been implemented to prove good faith" last year, such as the stopping of nuclear tests and rocket testing, the dismantling of the nuclear testing site and the non-proliferation commitment of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see any proper response from the US," he said.
"If we can't trust the US, we won't trust our national security capabilities and, in such circumstances, we can't disarm ourselves first."
Although Ri has reopened North Korea's family's objections to Washington's opposition to a "dissolved" approach to denuclearisation, according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it took steps, his statement seemed significant because he did not directly reject unilateral denuclearisation, as the phenian had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump in the lead summit between a US president and North Korea leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim committed to making progress towards "denomination of the Korean peninsula", while Trump provided guarantees on North Korea's security.
North Korea sought an official ending to the Korean War 1950-1953, but the United States said the Phenian must first give up his nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington did not comply with requests for relief from the severe international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US insists on the option "first denuclearisation" and increases the pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose in a coercive manner, which is even objecting to "the declaration of the end of the war", Ri said.
“The impression that sanctions can kneel on us is an illusion that only people who don’t know us have.
But the problem is that long-term sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump referred to by US leader to the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, President of South Korea, over the past five months, adding: "If the problem of denuclearisation had been negotiated with South Korea and not the US, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse."
Even under these conditions, Ri's speech tone was very different from last year's speech when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the U.S. territory with rockets from North Korea after "Malefic President" Trump called Kim a "om-racet" in a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, which threatened North Korea last year with "total destruction", praised Kim for her courage to initiate the disarmament process, but stated that the work was barely starting and that sanctions would remain valid until North Korea is denuclearised.
On Wednesday, Trump said that there is no planned period for this and added: “It doesn’t matter if it lasts two or three or five months.”
China and Russia say that the Phenian should be repaid by the UN Security Council for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday to the UN Security Council: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue to be effective and uninterrupted until we have complete, final and confirmed denuclearisation."
The Security Council has unanimously increased the sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to block funds for nuclear programmes and for phenian ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri on the colours of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit the Phenian again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not have too good results.
When he left Phenian in July, he said progress had been made, but after just a few hours, North Korea complained that he had made "bandster threats".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed to dismantle a rocket launch ramp and a nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump promised to Singapore and that he wanted to normalise Washington relations.
Harvard students are taking courses on how to get enough rest
A new Harvard University course this year encourages students to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the growing "macho" culture that makes them subject to "all night" learning sessions, energize with a lot of caffeine.
A scientist has found that students of the most prestigious universities in the world often do not even possess the basic concepts of how they should care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the one who created the course, which is believed to be the first of this type in the United States.
It was inspired to create the course after holding a conference on the impact of sleep deprivation on the ability to learn.
“At last, a girl came and said to me, ‘Why is this said to me just now, in the last year?’
She told me that she had never been told about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, introduced this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits help to improve academic and athletic performance, as well as general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The course that lasts an hour may involve a series of interactive tasks.
A section presents an image of a living room, and students can click on the coffee dogs, beads, sports pants and books to tell them what are the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep failure, but also about the importance of a sleep program.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily program.
“We know that we cannot immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we think they have the right to know, just as anyone has the right to know what the effects of smoking are on health," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that makes students proud that they have learned all night still exists, he adds, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure imposed on students have transformed sleep deprivation into a growing problem.
Sufficient sleep, of good quality, should be a student's "secret weapon" for combating stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation makes the brain think that the body is hungry, which makes the students feel hungry constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student in California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler create the course, after participating in one of his courses in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for all students.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all post-university students to complete a similar study programme before joining this institution where the competition is arduous.
Professor Czeisler advised students to schedule an alarm to know when it is time to sleep, as well as for the waking hour, and to know the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause difficulties when they try to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal is to win Gerrard's team
Rangers suffer from another case of displacement depression because Dolly Menga's hit sentenced Steven Gerrard's unconvincing team to a 1-0 match in Livingston.
The team from Ibrox wanted to win the first move from the 4-1 triumph won in February against St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team managed to give Gerrard the second defeat of 18 games as a coach, which puts Rangers with eight points next to Hearts, the authoritarian leaders of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga wrote seven minutes before the break and the uninspired Rangers didn't seem at all able to equalize.
The Rangers thus fell on the sixth position in the classroom, while Livingston went up the third place, behind the Hibernian, to a difference of one goal.
And Rangers might also face other problems, because the Calum Spence shower arbitrator had to be treated for a head wound after an object was, apparently, thrown from the audience's fans' hair.
Gerrard changed eight players from the lottery that won easily against Air in the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 players from Livingstone who managed to get equal to Hearts last week and had every reason to be proud of the way his well-trained lot suffocated his opponents during the match.
Even if Rangers had a superior possession, Livingston used the rings they had more effectively.
He should have marched just two minutes after the start of the game, when Menga's first step pushed Scott Pittman to the door defensed by Allan McGregor, but the middleman missed a very good opportunity.
A deep-rooted hit by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, sent it to the bar.
Rangers took control, but they left the impression that more hope than they trusted in their game in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should have received a penalty when he hit Steven Lawless in the 15th minute of the game, but Arbitrary Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian request.
Rangers managed only two knocks on the front door, but the former porter on Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was not disturbed at all by Lassana Coulibaly's head or by the weak beat of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the 34th minute of the Livingstones didn't respect the trend of the game, no one can deny that it was deserved, even for the effort done.
Again, Rangers failed to prevent a deep center of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent Scott Robinson's ball, which kept him calm and passed on to Menga, who ended up with a simple hit.
Gerrard acted on the break when he changed Ryan Kent with Coulibaly; this movement almost gave way right away, when the extreme centred Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of the holes to block him.
However, Livingston continued to attract visitors to exactly the same type of match she prefers, with Lithgow and Halkett who intercepted post-centre centres.
Holt's team could have extended the advantage in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs' hit, and then Lithgow sent his head to the side of the corner.
Glenn Middleton, the Rangers reserve, asked for a penalty at the end of the game, when Jacobs hit, but again, Thomson did not agree.
Almanah: inventor of Geiger office
And now, a page from our Sunday morning Almalah: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago (and the numerator CONTINUE...), is the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as Geiger counter.
A key device for science ever since, the Geiger Count has become essential for pop culture, as has been done in the film "The Bells of San Coronado" (1950), in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played the role of a cowboy with unlikely scientific inclination:
Man: "What else is that?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you wear these shells, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Yes, I hear a lot of applause!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before he was 63 years old.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "detect" harmful cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "detect" harmful cells and destroy them
As part of treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise harmful cells
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, their alteration into a laboratory
They can "detect" a common protein of many cancers and are then re-injected
A test vaccine provides promising results in patients with a cancer range.
Ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognise harmful cells has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, changing them into a laboratory so that they can "detect" a common protein of many cancers, called HER2, then reinjection of cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Oncology Institute of Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have to do with a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "determines the growth of several types of cancer", including those of the breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, to take the immune cells from patients and to "learn" them to target cancer cells, also worked for the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West held a stand for Trump, while wearing a MAGA lock, after the appearance of SNL.
It didn't come out too well
Kanye West was killed in the studio during the Saturday Night Live show after a disillusioned show in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he intends to run for the 2020 elections.
After playing the third song, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great hat, the artist resigned in a speech against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
“Many times when I talk to a white person, I’m asked, ‘How can you like Trump?
Well, if I had been worried about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a scene where Matt Damon played, in which Hollywood star took over Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee on the allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West Diatribe filming was loaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock is trying to get over West with this post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had trouble picking because of his age.
"They tried to intimidate me into culis.
They told me, "Don't go out wearing this hat."
I've been attacked!
They told me I came down very low," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see how far down I've come?" and then he said, "I'm going to get Superman's cover, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love."
His comments attracted fugitives from the public at least twice, and members of the SNL team seemed to be distraught, Variety reported; a member of this team told the publication: "A complete silence has been reached in the studio."
West was invited to replace the last hour for soloist Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West raised a lot of frenzy when he interpreted song I Love it dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by the conservative group leader TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “For one of the bravest of us: I am grateful that you have faced the GLOATA.”
Karen Hunter, the head of a talk show, wrote on Twitter that West simply "was himself and this is wonderful".
"When I choose not to reward anyone (by buying music or clothing or by supporting art) about whom I think it embraces and expresses a harmful ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so are we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he has changed his name, announcing that from now on it is "the officially known being as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name; West is walking after Diddy, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the former legend of the music, Prince, changed his name into a symbol and then into the "former artist known as Prince".
Murder attempt charge for a stabbing in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant on the east side of Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defence lawyer is awaiting Monday before the Court of Belfast.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor.
Kit Harington, the star of the Ureala thrones, attacks toxic maleity
Kit Harington is known for the role of Jon Snow in the series of violent medieval fantasy Throne Urzeala, produced by HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that presenting these roles on the screen makes the boys think they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he seemed "something wrong" and wondered how the problem of toxic masculinity could be managed in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his colleague, Rose Leslie, who is 31 years old, has acknowledged that it is "very determined" to talk about this problem.
"Personally, I am very determined to talk about this now: where did I make a mistake with masculinity?" he asked.
"What have we taught men about how to be adults, given the problem we are facing now?"
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for increasing male toxicity through very male characters.
He continued: “What is born, and what is taught?
What's the lesson for young guys on TV and on the street, what makes them think they have to be a certain guy?
I think this is one of the great questions of our time: how can we change this?
Because it is clear that something wrong has happened with young people."
In the interview, he admitted that he will not play in any sort of series based on the Throne Urzela after the series ends in the summer of next year, saying that he "ended with the battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play in a new production of the True West Theatre of Sam Shepard, which presents the story of a film producer and his brother, who is taller.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened to her due to the Thrones Urzela series is that she met Rose's wife.
"I met my wife when I did this series, so she assured me the future of my family and my life from now on," Kit said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, Jon Snow's girlfriend, the character played by Kit in the series of fantasy winners of several Emmy awards.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of Chinese citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by this disease in China, officials say.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, unlike those in the past.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of blood transfusions infected.
However, the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials say at a conference in Yunnan province.
From one year to another, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was criminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widely considered.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually get married to a woman.
Many of the cases of disease transmission come from inappropriate sexual protection measures in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to anti-HIV medicines as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee has disclosed the data of the Republican Party senators, talks about "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Representative Maxine Waters denounced the charges Saturday that a member of his team posted personal information about three republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the charges are made by analysts and websites of "extremely right".
"Minitions, lies and other miserable lies," Waters said in a post on Twitter.
Public information included the personal addresses and phone numbers of the senators. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Tuesday, posted by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of improper sexual behavior against Brett Kavanaugh, nominated as a judge at the Supreme Court.
The leak of information took place shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of posts was associated with the Waters office and presented information to a Waters team member, Hill reported.
"These baseless accusations are completely false, an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of the team whose identity, personal and safety information was compromised as a result of these false accusations was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
These baseless accusations are completely false, an absolute lie."
Waters' statements were criticised online shortly after they were made, including the former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that he does not have the temperament needed to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, it doesn't have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be challenging.
He must not question the defendant's motives.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to that of Judge Kavanaugh, criticized by the democrats, who said he seemed a little too angry during Tuesday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican who is running against Waters in the elections in the middle of the mandate, also commented on the situation on Twitter.
"It's important, if it's true," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said her office warned "the appropriate legal authorities and entities regarding these false accusations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be discovered," she continued, "and that they will be accountable to the law for all their destructive and dangerous actions for any member of my team."
Review Johnny English strikes again: parody without flags of spy movies, with Rowan Atkinson in the main role
It has become a tradition to look for a meaning associated with Brexit in any new British film, but this does not apply to the new film series of parades of action films that has as its main character Johnny English, the series that began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English returns.
Will this remarkable satire of how strange we are to become the nation's new export opportunity?
Anyway, Johnny English, the incompetent spy with his eyes staring and his rubber face, was renewed to the second time the license to destroy everything. Name of the character means, first of all, that it is a general comic creation for the cinematographic public in unspoken English-language countries.
He is, of course, the fearful secret agent who, despite his claims at luxury and extravagance, has a bit of Clouseau, a tip of Mr. Bean and a knife tip from that guy who contributed with a single note to the music theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
The character is based on the explorer and the mysterious man without the country that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard's TV ads, who left chaos behind.
This JE's last adventure has also one or two nice moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and the wheels of the rotor hit his coiff.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is highlighted, but humor is rather weak and, strangely, superfluous, especially because the "serious" films, such as the 007 series or the impossible Mission, provide reliable comic moments as an ingredient.
Mortality seems to be more addressed to children than adults and, for me, Johnny English's dazzling adventures are not as inventive and intelligent as Atkinson's moving movie jokes when they play in Bean's role.
As usual, the premise is always that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the British supersecret web network of spies and revealed the identity of the British agents under cover, to the despair of the service agent, a regrettable role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last mistake for a pumped and ambushed prime minister, who already has a serious crisis because of the downturn in political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything he can with his character like Theresei May, but the scenario does not give him a chance to shine.
Its intelligence advisors inform it that all active spies have been compromised, so it must activate a reserve agent.
It is Johnny English himself, now working as a teacher in a high school, but also teaching lessons about how to be undercover. Here are some nice kids, because English runs a school-style spy academy of Rock.
English is brought back to Whitehall, for an emergency session, then met with his time partner, Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and precious character, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine's talent is a bit ironic.
Thus, these Batman and Robins of creating mischief in His Majesty's Secret Service return to action, confronting the beautiful dead woman Ophelia Bulletin, interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the spell of a billion-dollar charismatic technology industry that claims he can solve the UK IT problems: the Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start out in an odise of the stormy adventures: burn in candles, set fire to a French fashion restaurant, create chaos when they run off on the luxury boat of Volta, then start anarchy in pure form when they try to use a set of glasses for virtual reality to get familiar with the inside of Volta's house.
This last sequence is very ambitious, but whatever the cute and colorful film is, it looks like a television production for children.
A pretty mediocre movie.
Like the other Johnny English movies, I can't stop wondering: can the British cinema industry even give Rowan Atkinson a role in his talent?
Neglected laborers who plan to have British work four days a week, but to be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party would have a radical plan that the British would only work four days a week, but would be paid for five days.
The party seems to want the company's leaders to benefit from possible savings due to the artificial intelligence revolution (IA) by giving employees another day off.
So employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but the salary would not have been changed.
Sources say that the idea would be "appropriate" to the party's economic programme, which wants to shift the balance in favour of workers.
The four-day week shift is supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A source of leadership from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: “A policy review announcement is expected before the end of the year.
It won't happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an appropriate aspiration to the rebalancing party in favour of the worker, as well as to the general strategy of the party on industry."
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea; the four-day working week was one of the Green Party's promises in the 2017 campaign for general elections.
However, this aspiration is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not included in the party's calculation."
The cabinet's chancellor, John McDonnell, took advantage of last week's Labour Conference to describe his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said it is determined to take back the power of "frontless directors" and "professors" from the utility suppliers.
The plans of the shadow cabinet's Chancellor also refer to the fact that the current shareholders of the water supply regions might not fully recover their shares, because the Labour Government might receive "deductions" due to detected offences.
It also confirmed plans to appoint employees in company management boards and to create ownership funds to divest 10% of the equity of private sector firms to employees, which will receive annual dividends of up to approximately 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal on "60 Minutes" if Kavanaugh's investigation by the FBI would make him change his mind
The FBI's investigation of the charges brought by Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his candidacy as a judge in the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the republican senators could have convinced him no longer to support it because of the FBI's findings.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would make him change his mind.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do this than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
“I said this from the beginning of the hearings; I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened, when the charges appeared, and I asked him, "Are you guilty?"
The answer was decided, immediately, without mistake."
Graham's vote, however, seems to be dug in the rock.
"I am determined with regard to Brett Kavanaugh, so there would be a need for some explosive charges," he said.
"Mr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly rejects the charges," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of the persons appointed by it confirmed the report.
And it happened 36 years ago.
I doubt something's going to change."
What is the Global Citizens' Festival and has it managed to do something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Festival of Global Citizens, an annual music event attended by an impressive group of stars, with such an impressive mission: eradicating global poverty.
At the seventh edition, the Global Citizens' Festival will attract tens of thousands of people on the Central Park plausible, not only to follow artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true purpose of the event, to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens' Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of lawyers hoping to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (except where they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), spectators had to purchase a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending e-mails to world leaders, making phone calls or other significant things that help raise awareness of the goal of eliminating global poverty.
But what was the success of the Global Citizens' Festival when I'm only 12 years old to achieve the goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert a good way to convince them to act or is it just another case of so-called "clickivism", a concept that refers to people who feel they have done something by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, more than 19 million "actions" have been registered by its supporters, who have promoted different objectives.
The organisation says these actions have spurred world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group spoke of 390 commitments and announcements caused by its actions, in which at least $10 billion had already been spent or narrowed.
The group estimates that the funds secured so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership with headquarters in the UK of investors and intermediaries who have committed themselves to "help children grow to their full potential", which promised to offer Rwanda 35 million dollars to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 messages on Twitter from global citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens as well as you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition just a footnote in the history book," said Tracey Ulllman, Ambassador The Power of Nutrition, in front of the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions were undertaken in the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced that it would finance the The Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the most frequently asked questions on their website: "What makes you think you can eliminate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult journey, sometimes we will fall and make a mistake.
However, like the major civil rights or anti-apartheid movements that took place before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the artists who will sing at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the naval forces for a "block" that would make Russia's energy exports more difficult, says the Secretary of the Interior
Washington may, "if necessary", appeal to the naval forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including in the Middle East, said US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia's commitment to Syria, particularly where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason I am in the Middle East is that I want to mediate the sale of energy, as I do in Eastern Europe and in southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and methods of managing the situation.
"The United States has the capacity, through our naval forces, to ensure that the maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to create a barrier, so that energy does not come into the market," he said.
Zinke is addressed to participants to an event hosted by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that is declared "the voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
It continued by comparing the way Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is practically the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, the use and replacement of fuels," he said, saying about Russia that "he knows only one trick" because of the fossil fuel-dependent economy.
Statements come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to increase natural gas exports to Europe, to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, representatives of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "indecent" project of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which, according to Trump, would turn Berlin into a "prisoner" in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion project of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity at 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin stated that the fierce US opposition to the project is driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we are looking at things the same way: energy cannot be an instrument to put pressure on and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Aleksandr Novak, Minister of Energy in Russia, after a meeting with Rick Perry, US Energy Secretary in Moscow in September.
The US position drew criticism from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main industrial organisation in Germany, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), asked the US not to intervene in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third state taking part in our energy issues," said Dieter Kempf, president of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is "serious" to run for the 2020 presidential elections, says Senator of Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, Senator of Massachusetts, said on Saturday that he must "consider" seriously if he is to run for presidential elections after the mid-term elections.
During the meeting at the Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidate.
"It's time for a woman to go to Washington and repair our corrupt governance, and for this to take a strong woman," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will think seriously if I run for presidential elections."
Warren also had something to say about President Donald Trump during the opening meeting, saying that he "turned the country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was a very vocal critic of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a message posted on Friday's Twitter, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote".
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that even the majority of Warren's voters do not think they should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probable" votes in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of respondents support such a candidacy.
The poll has shown more support for a candidacy by former Governor Deval Patrick: 38% of respondents support a potential candidate and 48% oppose it.
Other names of well-known democrats who could run in 2020 are those of Vice-President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator of Vermont.
Biden said he would decide officially by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic stress syndrome that Track Palin suffers at a meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26-year-old, spent a year in Iraq after she joined in September.
Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence
"The pains that my own son has gone through after he has returned... can understand the suffering of other families who feel the ramifications of the post-traumatic stress syndrome and the consequences of the injuries that our soldiers are returning with," said Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to the public gathered at a rally to support Donald Trump.
Palin called his "elevator in the room" arrest and said that her son and other war veterans "are returning a little differently, harder, are returning wondering if there is any respect for what they and their soldiers from the armed and air forces, as well as all the other members of the Army, have done for the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, preventing the reporting of a domestic violence and the possession of a drunken firearm, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman of the Police Department of Wasilla.
18 states and the District of Colombia challenge a new asylum application policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims who try to escape the violence caused by street or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and District have completed a request for friend curiae on Friday in Washington to support a policy contest on asylum seekers, NBC News reports.
The full name of the claimant in the Grace v. Sessions process that the American Civil Liberties Union launched in August was not disclosed against federal policy.
She said her partner "and his violent sons, members of a gate," abused her, but US officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20th.
She was detained in Texas.
The state-owned lawyer representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produced a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as nations facing a generalized problem with domestic violence and street violence.
The new US asylum policy has annulled a 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Council which has enabled immigrants without acts trying to escape domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said on Friday that the new policy "ignores the decades of state, federal and international legislation".
"The federal law says that all asylum applications must be tried on the basis of the facts and specific circumstances of the application, and such limitation violates this principle," writes a friend curiae in his application.
In addition, lawyers argue on the claim that the policy that refuses to enter immigrants affects the US economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "supply the necessary labour force".
Jeff Sessions, U.S. Attorney General, ordered in June judges for immigration cases to no longer grant asylum to victims who are trying to escape the abuse and violence of the streets.
"The asylum is granted to those who leave their country driven by persecution or fear because of discrimination on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a social group or because of political opinion," Sessions said on 11 June, when the policy announced.
The role of asylum has never been to solve all the problems people face every day in the world, not even all the serious problems.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu, where the number of deaths doubled, in a race against a timer to find survivors
For survivors, the situation has become more and more serious.
"The situation seems very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who ironed her baby suffering from fever at an evacuation centre in the destroyed city of Palu.
"The ambulances bring troops all the time.
Drinking water is insufficient."
Residents began to return to their ruined houses and organize their flood goods, trying to save everything that could be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Richter scale, were overwhelmed by the situation.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Harris, who suffered fractures at the spine and shoulder, rest outside the Palu military hospital, where patients are treated in the open due to strong and continuous replications.
He has eyes full of tears as he recalls how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room from the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was caught in the ruins of the wall, I think," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife call for help, then just keep quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope I'm safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of "abuse" of "propaganda"
A week after an official newspaper in China published a four-page advertisement in a newspaper in the United States where it praised the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US Ambassador in China accuses Beijing of using the American press to distribute propaganda materials.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred Wednesday to the supplement paid by China in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of mixing in the November 6th elections for Congress, an accusation China rejects.
The accusation that Beijing is trying to get mixed up in the US elections marked what US officials have said to Reuters is a new phase in a Washington climbing campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertising in which they promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently blocked in a growing trade war, which involves rising import tariffs.
The prices imposed by China as a revenge, at the beginning of the trade war, were created to affect exporters from states such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, told experts from China and the USA.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods in China, said Beijing injured American workers, farmers and businessmen.
In a Sunday editorial published in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China "continues to use this abuse by publishing advertising advertisements in our own free press".
"When spreading propaganda through the publication of an ad in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government does not respect the tradition of freedom of expression and a free press in America," Branstad writes.
"On the other hand, at the newsroom on the street from here in Beijing you will find few voices of dissidents and you will not see any real reflection of the divergent opinions of Chinese citizens about China's worrying economic journey, given that the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans alienate female voters before the elections in the middle of the Kavanaugh scandal, analysts warn
Since many of the top republicans support and protect Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, of several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts have warned that there will be a reaction, especially from women, during the next elections from half of the mandate.
The emotions created by this scandal were extremely strong, and the majority of the Republicans who discussed it publicly intend to continue their vote.
"Such reactions will not be forgotten," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, for The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he has doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute initiative on an FBI investigation will calm the angry voter down.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, will not forget tomorrow and will not forget in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and spokesperson for the national progressive group, according to Washington newspaper D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors called "Come November!" while protesting the Senate halls when Republicans controlling the Judicial Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination process despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the democrats will be very great," said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst for the news site.
"People say they were already very big and that's true.
But it could be even bigger, especially among female voters indisputable from the suburbs and young electorate, between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although not in favour of the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which he detailed the allegations of sexual abuse brought to the highest court, analysts suggested that there might be a reaction if the Republicans continued the confirmation process.
"This has turned into a mess for Republicans," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Republican Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only the vote of the committee or the final vote or the possibility of Kavanaugh being confirmed, but also how the Republicans have treated this situation and how they have treated it," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, an electoral support group of Democrats, for the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be relatively divided about the part they should believe in after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh: a little more seem to believe in him afterwards.
A new survey conducted by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents believe in State or that it is likely that Ford's testimony was true, while 35% said that he believed in State or that Kavanaugh's testimony is likely to be true.
In addition, 38% said Kavanaugh lied, probably or certainly, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating the charges made by Ford, as well as at least another person, Deborah Ramirez, reported the Guardian.
Last week, Ford vowed in front of the Senate Judicial Committee that Kavanaugh had abused her, in a state of drunkenness, at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the nomination to the Supreme Court exposed the genital organs to her as she participated in a party while students were in Yale in 1980.
Inventor of the World Wide Web plans to establish a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of legend in the field of technology, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, Berners-Lee's open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has the right to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee boasted that the intention behind the Imprupt behind is "global domination".
"Now we have to do it," he talked about startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data archives" or PODs.
It may contain lists of contacts, programs, calendars, music libraries or other personal and professional instruments.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify would all be available in a single browser, all of a sudden.
What is unique about this online personal data archive is that the user has full control over who can access this type of information.
The company refers to this as "personal data consolidation".
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea is to Inrupt to contribute with adequate resources, processes and skills, so as to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company is composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a team of developers working on the project and a volunteer programming community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not talk to “Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change when their business models are completely over the head suddenly.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post published Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of a new Internet on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even after Inrupt launches, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the clergy who won the Crucea Victoria in World War I is celebrated
The only cleric of the Church of England who won a medal in the Crucea Victoria as a fighter in the First World War was celebrated in its hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29, 1918 in the Bellengise and Lehaucourt attack.
He was killed by a lunetic four days later and never knew that he was honored with the highest military honor of the United Kingdom.
A memorial stone was discovered Saturday by his two grandsons during the Rushden parade in Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it is "symbolically beautiful" that the stone will be developed exactly 100 years after the fact that his grandfather won the medal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal of Saint-Quentin "with a very great hole and under the intense fire of artillery and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the line first and, with "a fantastic bravado", opened the way for the soldiers, then attacked himself with an artillery cube and managed to remove three of the detachment weapons.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German lunetist on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "a thing I know I will never be able to equal, but that makes me feel ashamed".
He, along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid down a crown after the parade, which was led by the Youth Orchestra of Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said he "was very honored to play a part in the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support he has given to a large number of people".
MMA fans stayed three all night to see Bellator 206, but they got cartoons with Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine that you've been watching Bellator 206, an event with many stars all night long, just so you can't follow the main event.
The San Jose event program contained 13 fights, including six on the main panel, and had to be broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 p.m., just when Gegard Mousasi was preparing to face Rory MacDonald, British viewers were amazed when the broadcast was replaced with an episode from Peppa Pig.
Some were not at all grateful because they had been awake all night to see the fight.
A fan described on Twitter the transition to an animated drawing for children as "a kind of stupid joke".
"Governmental regulations say that this content is not appropriate for 6 a.m., so they had to change to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of Bellator for marketing and communication, when asked about transmission.
"Peppa pig, yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that in the future they will program their events in such a way that they can also be monitored by spectators from the UK.
"When I think about reinstatements, I think we could probably solve it," Coker said.
"But it's six in the morning on a Sunday here and we won't be able to do that until Sunday, our hour, or months, their hour.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, I started getting a lot of text messages and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to solve the situation, I thought it was a technical mess.
But it wasn't about this, it was about a government regulation.
I can promise you it won't happen any more next time.
We'll sum up five fights instead of six, as we usually do.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "less" because of sexuality
Olympic sculptor Tom Daley says that he grew up feeling that he is inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he only realized when he came to school that "not everyone is like me".
Invited to the first Desert Island Discs show presented by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, he said he was talking about gay people's rights to give them other "sperence".
The athlete also said that when he became a parent, he cared less about the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual performer of the traditional show, will be missing a few months due to a disease.
Invited to the first edition presented by Laverne, Daley said that when he was a child, he felt "less" because "I was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said: “So far, these feelings of inferiority and the feeling that I felt different were the real things that gave me the strength and the stamina to achieve success.”
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympic Games became a renowned supporter of LGBT campaigns and benefited from the appearance of the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to ask more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he decided to speak because he felt lucky that he could live free, without pursuit, and because he wanted to give others "sperence".
The three world champions said that "was taken by surprise" because he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daley married last year to Oscar's winning filmmaker, who is 20 years older than he, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a fragile age," he participated in the first Olympics when he was only 14 years old, and his father died of cancer after three years, he said, it's hard to find someone of the same age who had to go through the same good and bad times.
In June, the two became the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, which, Daley says, changed his "whole perspective".
"If I had been asked last year, I wouldn't have been interested in anything but winning a gold medal," he said.
“You know what? There are more important things than gold medals at the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the name of his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he wanted was to find out if he got tickets for the 2012 London Olympics, because he wanted to be first.
"I couldn't tell him you couldn't be first," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and only after he stopped breathing and died I finally accepted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed of a whole life, jumping in front of spectators from my country at the Olympics, there is no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired him in selected music, Heather Small's Proud, a song that encouraged him before the Olympic Games and still exhilarates him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15.
Mickelson, out of shape, went to the reserve bank on Saturday, in the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record Saturday, when he will play in the forty-seventh match of the Ryder Cup, but he will have to get back to a good shape so that this is not an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennal event for the twenty-second time, another record, was passed on Captain Jim Fury's reserve bank for fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has been many times for the United States team, the major tournament winner turned the day into a day between being a major for the teammates and practicing his hits, hoping that he would correct what was wrong.
The 48-year-old player has never had the right drivers, not even in the best time of his career, so it is not the best choice for the narrow terrain of Le Golf National, where long rough areas often punish the wrong hits.
And if the field is not a big enough challenge, in the ninth match on Sunday, Mickelson will face Francesco Molinari, the methicus champion of the British Open, who joined the Tommy Fleetwood news and won all four games of the week.
Mickelson's game could be absolutely crucial for Americans, led by four points at the entry into the 12 simple games, which must begin in force at this stage.
Furik made himself confident in his player's ability, but he couldn't have said anything else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, beat me on the shoulder, hugged me and told me he'd be ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has contributed very much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play in two games.
I imagined more, but this has happened and this is how we thought we should proceed.
He wants to play, like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will exceed Nick Faldo's record for most of the games played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which no longer stood up to his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 winnings, 20 lost and seven and a half, although Furyk said his presence has brought untold benefits to the team.
"It's funny, it's sarcastic, smart, it likes to play with players, it's a great guy in the team's dress," he explained.
"I think young players are having fun with him, it was fun to see him doing this during the week.
His role is more important, not just a game."
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that considerable progress might soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that the considerable advance held before the first day of the simple trials in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Danes started in the 1997 Valderrama game, when the team led by Captain Seven Ballesteros led the Americans with five points, but only if he managed to defeat them with a minimum difference, from 141⁄2 to 131⁄2.
"I remember that I had a considerable advance at Valderrama; I had a big advance at Brooklyn, where I lost, and at Valderrama, where we could barely win," said Bjorn (in image) after following as a 2018 team, which won 5-3, both on Friday and yesterday, and now runs with 10-6 on Le Golf National.
“So history shows me, me and my team, that it’s not ready yet.
We have to play the maximum tour tomorrow.
Let's go out on the ground and do everything perfectly.
The game is over only after the points have passed on the table.
We have a goal and this is to win this trophy, it must remain the goal.
I always said, we have to focus on the 12 players on our team, but we know what lies ahead for us elsewhere: the best players in the world."
Delighted at the way his players handled a difficult field, Bjorn added: “I don’t rush to conclusions.
It's all the other way tomorrow.
Tomorrow's individual performances are important, and this is different.
It's great to be on the ground with a partner when things go well, but when you're on your own, then you're tested to the maximum, as a golfer.
This is the message you have to deliver to players, that it must be in the best form tomorrow.
Now leave their partner behind and have to play as well as I can."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, the captain of the adverse team, hopes that his players will play better on the test simply than they did with their partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of such return on the last day: he was on the Brooklyn winning team, then on the losing side when Europe succeeded in "Miracle of Medina".
"Remember every word," he answered when asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, managed to encourage his players before the last day.
"We have 12 major matches tomorrow and we would like to start with some quick victories, like at Brooklyn, like at Medina.
When the inertia develops in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle-class games.
We created the proper lot and ordered the players as we wish, you know, we're trying to create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to lead the fight: he will face Rory McIlroy in the main game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the second half of the program.
"I have chosen this group of players, in this order, because I think it covers all subjects," Bjorn said about the lot for the simple test.
Germany's new warship, delayed again
Germany's newest fleet of naval forces should have been put into operation in 2014 to replace the old warships in the Cold War, but this will only happen in the year due to poor systems and rising costs, the local press reported.
The entry into operation of the ship "Rheinland-Pfalz", the standard ship of the new Baden-Württemberg freight class, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which cites a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been introduced into the maritime forces in 2014, but problems encountered after delivery have affected this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class vessels that the Military Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
They are supposed to be equipped with a powerful tuna, with a range of anti-aircraft and anti-vas rockets, as well as with stealth technologies, which provide a low-grade radar, infrared and acoustic print.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; it should be possible for the new frigates to be able to go on missions for two years without returning to the original port.
However, the continuing delays mean that these last-generation warships, which are said to increase the maritime strength of Germany, will already be obsolete before entering service, notes Die Zeit.
F125 F125 was discussed in the press last year, when Germany's Military Navy officially refused to take the vessel and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time Marina Militarya returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
There is not much information available about the reasons for the refusal, but the German media quoted a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that would have made the warship useless in a battle mission.
Software defects were particularly important because the Baden-Württemberg class vessels will be operated by a crew of approximately 120 sailors, only half of the crews of the oldest Bremen class.
In addition, it was proved that the vessel had too much weight, which reduced its performance and limited the ability of the Military Navy to add future capabilities.
It is believed that the 7,000 tonnes vessel "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as difficult as the German vessels used in World War II.
In addition to the defective mechanisms, and the price of the whole project, including the equipment training, has become a cause for concern.
It is said to have reached a staggering figure of EUR 3.1 billion (US$ 3.6 billion) from the initial price of EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems of the newest fritters are of particular importance given the latest warnings that Germany's maritime power is falling.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the defence committee in the German parliament, admitted that the Military Navy "started to remain without vessels that could be sent to missions".
The officer said that the problem has steadily increased over time, as the old vessels have been removed without being replaced with some new ones.
It regretted that none of the baden-Württemberg-class frigates had entered into service within the Military Navy.
National Trust is spying on the secret life of the bees
Our research that is carried out on a Scottish Highlands property wants to reveal how the lilys use the surrounding environment to hunt their prey.
It is hoped that the discoveries will reveal new things about the behavior of these unmanned flying mammals and will help future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will analyse common spicy bees and pigment bees, as well as eardrums and water bees from the Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in key locations around the property to track the smoothings during the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using manual detectors.
Specialized audio analysis of all recordings will estimate the frequency of sounds made by bees and what species emits certain sounds.
They will be produced and a map of the habitat and a report to create a detailed picture of their behavior in the environment.
Rob Dewar, an NTS nature conservation consultant, hopes that the results will reveal what habitat areas are most important for bees and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of the lawn, and is the best way to maintain forest pastures for bees and other associated species.
The lily populations of Scotland and the whole of Britain have declined considerably in the last century.
They are at risk of construction and development work affecting the cubes, but also loss of habitat.
And wind turbines and public lighting are risks, as are bat traps and some chemical treatments for building materials, but also attacks by domestic cats.
Actually, lilacs aren't blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to trapping the market.
They use a sophisticated eco-circuit technique to accurately identify insects and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major parks and 76,000 hectares of land from the country, is very serious about lilacs.
They have ten trained experts, who conduct periodic studies, control the cubes and sometimes perform rescue missions.
The organisation even created the first and only reserve of lilacs in Scotland, on the Thrave River in Dumfries and Galloway, where there are eight of the ten species of lilac in Scotland.
Mouse Manager David Thompson says this is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here, at Thrave, the area is wonderful for lilys," he says.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a perfect habitat.
But there are many things we don't know about lilies, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand why they need to multiply."
It underlines the importance of looking for bees before performing maintenance work on properties, as simply unintentional destruction of a mother cub could kill up to 400 women and chickens, which could destroy the entire local population.
Lilies are protected, and killing, harassing or disrupting them, as well as destroying their cubes, are prohibited actions.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official in Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help them.
It said: “When we have a lot of learning about lilacs and we don’t know how the populations evolve for many of our species.”
Ronaldo denies charges of rape while lawyers prepare to file a trial in Germany
Cristiano Ronaldo said the charges against him are "fake news" and that some people "will make a claim" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to put in trial the German magazine Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and the Juventus team were accused of violating a woman from America, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that the footballer paid it $375.000 to not talk about the incident.
A few hours after the charges were published, in a video broadcast on Instagram Live for the 142 million followers of his, Ronaldo, at the age of 33, said they were fake news.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today are fake news," said the gold balloon winner in front of the video room.
"I want them to make a claim using my name.
It's normal.
They want to get famous using my name, but I'm used to it.
I'm a happy man and everything's okay," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to bring Der Spiegel to trial because of these charges, which they have called "an unacceptable report of suspicions of privacy," according to Reuters.
Counsel Christian Schertz says the player will seek compensation for "equivalent moral damage with an adequate amount for the gravity of the act, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident would have taken place in June 2009, in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he violated anal, according to the documents submitted to the District Court of the Clark Committee in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell on her knees and told her that he was "a good boy" in proportion to "99%", and that he was betrayed by that "one percent".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that he had sexual relations with the accused, but that they were consensual.
Majorga claims to have addressed the police and that the photographs of her injuries were taken to the hospital, but later he accepted an understanding outside the courtroom because it was "suffered by the possibility of revenge" and was concerned that "will be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman is now seeking to cancel that understanding because she continues to be traumatized by the incident.
At the time he was accused, Ronaldo was about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid. In this summer, he was transferred to the Italian giant Juventus, after a transaction worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Great Britain "would regret forever" loss of car manufacturers
The Great Britain "would regret forever" if it lost world leader status in the production of vehicles after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is "anxious" that Toyota UK said to the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it will temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese auto manufacturer said that the impact of delays at the border in the case of an unagreed Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, where the brands Auris and Avensis of Toyota are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, said they are afraid of leaving the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit, it will close the Oxford factory where the Mini model is produced for a month.
The main concerns are created by what producers call risks associated with the supply chain in the case of an unagreed Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on the basis of the "fix time" principle: for the machines manufactured by the control, the parts arrive at 37-minute intervals from UK and EU suppliers.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, problems at the border could arise which, according to industrial producers, could cause delays and a lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than the inventory for a day at its Derbyshire factory, the company says, so production would be stopped.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future EU relations is "precisely calibrated to avoid these delays at the border".
"There must be an agreement. We want to have the best agreement, which will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the present, but also to benefit from this opportunity," he told the BBC Radio Today.
"The evidence not only from Toyota, but also from other producers, shows that we must be able to continue to use what was a set of successful supply chains."
Toyota could not specify how long production would have to be stopped, but warned that high prices could reduce the competitive capacity of the long-term factory and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who works at Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the United Trade Union at the factory, said that members are increasingly concerned: “The experience taught me that, after disappearing, these jobs are no longer coming back.”
A spokesperson for the government said: "I have created a precise and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "a week ahead", because the fight for Brett Kavanaugh, nominated at the Supreme Court, continued, said the White House Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's interference in the elections, links between Trump's and Russia's aid and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
The rumors about Trump's ability to fire the Deputy Attorney General, thus endangering Mueller's independence, circled around Washington's circles for months.
Early in the month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president through Amendment 25 to the US Constitution.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But last month he went to the White House, and reports say he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced for Thursday, which was then at the headquarters of the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would rather not fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate's legal commission, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump requested an investigation for a week by the FBI regarding the charges against Kavanaugh, which delayed, again, the Senate's vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared Sunday at Fox News.
Asking about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “It may be this week or may be delayed for a week, taking into account all the other things that are happening now in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up."
Some reporters would challenge this statement: Sanders no longer had a press briefing at the White House on September 10th.
Master Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the reduction in the number of briefings was not caused by antipathy to TV reporters, who like to play the show, although he added: “I don’t deny that they like to play the show.”
Then he suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The President participates in several questions and answers sessions than all previous presidents," she said, adding without mentioning any evidence: "I have analysed the figures."
"I'm going to have some briefings," Sanders said, but "I think it's much better that the press has the opportunity to address questions directly to the President of the United States, not me.
We are trying to do this most of the time and you have noticed that we have done this many times in recent weeks, and discussions with the President of the United States will replace press briefings when it is available."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences with the dignitaries who visit him.
The press conferences granted exclusively by him are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why this is happening, with an impromptu appearance, in the bizarre alleles, in front of the reporters gathered.
A Secretary of State of the Ministry of Health is addressed in a letter to EU employees from the National Health Service (NHS) of Scotland on Brexit's issues
The Secretary of State wrote to EU employees working at the NHS branch in Scotland to express their appreciation on behalf of the country and their desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Parliament of Scotland, sent the letter under conditions where he is less than six months until the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to bear the costs of applying for permanent residency status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued, waiting for decisions to be taken in this fall.
However, the UK Government has begun to prepare itself increasingly and for a different scenario, in which there would be no agreement for exit from the EU.
I know it's a very stressful time for you.
For this reason, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate each employee's contribution, regardless of nationality.
Members of the European Union, but also beyond that, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service and also benefit the patients and communities we serve.
You can consider Scotland your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after a stroke
The founding of Tennessee State Tigers, Christian Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgery after he suffered a stroke on Saturday, in the match his team lost in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores team, with a score of 31-27, Mike Organ de la Tennessee said.
Coach Head of the Tennessee State team, Rod Reed, told reporters that the strike took place shortly before the break.
"It got to the shower line and just collapsed," Reed said.
Abercrombie was masked by physical and medical personnel on the line before sitting on a plate and transporting it from the field for a detailed assessment.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left the operation to which he had been subjected at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details on the type/extension of the accident" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, a student in year 2, is in his first season at Tennessee State after he moved from Illinois.
On Saturday, he managed to make five total cards before leaving the game, reaching a number of 18 cards throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will receive a higher seal court fee to buy a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will pay a higher seal court fee for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom, following that additional money will be used to help homeless people, according to the new plans of the Conservative Party
This change will neutralize Corbyn's efforts to attract young people with the right to vote
The stamp court fee will apply to persons who are not taxable and taxable in the United Kingdom
Treasure is expected to reach up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher rate of time tax on the purchase of a property in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people, as Theresa May is about to announce today.
The exchange will be considered an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young people with the right to vote, promising more advantageous houses and seeing people with high incomes.
The higher seal court tax will apply to natural and legal persons who are not taxable and taxable persons in the United Kingdom, and the additional money thus obtained will be used to support the Government's efforts to help homeless persons.
Suprataxa, which is added to the current seal court fee, including the levels raised two years ago for the second property and the properties purchased for rent, could reach a 3% value.
The treasury expects this change to bring up to 120 million pounds per year.
About 13% of the new properties built in London are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult for those who want to buy their first home.
Several prosperous areas of the country, especially capital, have become "phantom towns" because of the high number of foreign buyers spending a great deal of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just a few weeks since Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the legal stamp tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of holding property prices up as a result of the acquisition of land without using them and asked Theresa May to give up taxes on affordable houses, with a view to solving the "house problem" in the UK.
Corbyn announced a series of attractive proposals for real estate reforms, including controls on rentals and the cessation of uninhabited evacuations.
He also wants to provide councils with greater power as regards the construction of new houses.
Theresa May said: “Last year I stated that I will devote my prime minister’s mandate to the fulfillment of the British dream, a better life for every new generation.
And that means remedying existing problems on the real estate market.
The Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies with foreign offices, to buy homes as easily as British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of having a house has become a lot too far away, and life in vile conditions is too real."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to be the manager of Scotland's national team"
Jack Ross, the manager of the Sunderland football team, said that "his final goal" is to become, at some point, the manager of the Scottish national team.
At the age of 42, the Scottish enjoys the challenge of "relaunching" the Nordic club, which is currently in place 3 in the First League, with a difference of three points towards the first place.
He moved to the team this summer from the Luminian Stadium after succeeding, last season, the return of the St. Mirren football team to the first Scottish Premiership division.
"I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
We got to the B team of the nation and so on," Ross told the BBC Sports Sound.
“But I spent a lot of my childhood following Scotland’s games at Hampden with my father, and I always wanted to come back.
But I will only be part of this opportunity if I succeed as the club manager."
Among Ross' predecessors, as managers of the Sunderland Club, are Dick Advocated, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of the Alloa Athletic club said he had no emotion to be the successor to such dedicated names and to such an important club, after refusing offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The only thing that worries me and that might affect my success is the question "Can I help this team get back to the Premier League?"
There is no doubt that the structure and facilities in this club allow it to be in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to make it there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel successful is to contribute to the club's return to the Premier League."
Ross has only three years' experience in driving, after a period in which he was assistant manager at Dumbarton and another 15 months spent as a member of the Hearts training staff.
Then he helped the Alloa club come back after returning to Division C and managed to save St. Mirren from the retrogradation, helping the team win the championship title next season.
Ross said he's feeling better now than his entire career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was a decisive moment," he said about taking over the management of the Alloa Club.
“I really thought my role as manager was better than that of the player.
Maybe it sounds weird, because I had a good time, I won well, and I had a few moments of success.
But it's hard to be a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them every week.
I face similar situations as a manager in terms of stress and pressure, but I feel that it's the right part for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now that I can do this, I feel that it's the best thing that suits me in my adult life."

The ideal time to drink a beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., according to a poll
The heat wave of this summer has led to an increase in income in the British pubs, but more pressure on the chains of restaurants.
According to figures, pubs and bars recorded an increase of 2.7% in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a representative of CGA, who provides business advisory services and who carried out the survey, said: “The constant heat and participation of England in the World Cup over a longer period than expected contributed to a type in July, similar to that of the previous month, when pubs registered up to 2.8% more customers, while restaurants had a worse period.
The number of smaller customers with 1.8% in the restaurant industry in June has also decreased more in July.
The pubs and bars that serve only drinks have recorded a much higher profit than restaurants.
And the pubs serving food have recorded losses caused by heat, but not as large as those of restaurants.
Looks like people went out of town just to consume drinks.
Drink sales at all bars and pubs increased by 6.6% this month, and food fell by 3%."
Paul Newman, a representative of the RSM company that provides services in the hospitality industry, said: “These results continue to be the trend we have observed since the end of April.
The weather conditions and the impact of sporting and social events remain among the most important factors contributing to the associated sales of the OOH advertising market.
It is no wonder that restaurants continue to record losses, although the decrease in sales by 4.8% year-on-year will be added to current cost pressures.
The cannibal summer could not come at a worse time for food industry operators and only time will decide whether the more moderate temperatures recorded in August will bring better news."
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including the new ones opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the small number of new locations launched.
The company that monitors the sales of pubs, bars and restaurants in the United Kingdom, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined profit of over 9 billion pounds, being the official industry standard.
One of the five children has a secret account on a socialization network he hides from his parents
According to a survey, one in five children, some even under 11 years of age, has a secret account on a socialization network hidden by parents and teachers
A survey conducted at the level of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "false Insta" accounts
News increased fears about sexual content posts
20% of students said they have a "principal" account that they show their parents
One of the five children, some even under 11 years of age, creates an account on a socialization network that keeps it hidden from adults.
A survey carried out on a number of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in "false Insta" accounts, referring to the Instagram photo sharing platform.
The news has increased fears about sexual content posts.
20% of students said they had a "principal" and "clean" account that they showed their parents, but that they also had other private accounts.
A mother, who mistakenly discovered the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter, observed the position of a teenager who asked to be "violated".
According to research conducted by the UK Digital Awareness company and the Association of Directors (HMC – Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference) of independent schools, 40% of young people aged 11-18 have two profiles, and half of them have recognized that they have secret accounts.
HMC Association Director Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that so many adolescents are trying to create online spaces that parents and teachers do not have access to."
Eliid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Sports Commission
Elihid Doyle was elected as Director, without executive powers, of the Scottish Sports Commission, at the annual general meeting of the management body.
Doyle is the most decorated field and track athlete in Scotland, and Ian Beattie, president, described the change as a great opportunity for those who make decisions about sports to benefit from the vast experience it has gained internationally in the past decade.
"Eilid enjoys respect for the whole community of athletes from Scotland, the UK, as well as the rest of the world and we are sure that Scottish athletes will have significant benefits together with their inclusion in the commission," Beattie said.
Doyle further said: "I am pleased that I will be able to represent athletes and I hope to have a real contribution and can help in the way sports activities are carried out in Scotland."
The American Nationality athlete, who won 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games, in addition to the four gold medals won at the Olympic Games, is now a frequent commentator at BBC, has been invalidated after suffering a transient ischaemic attack.
It wrote on Twitter: “A month later, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time would decide whether I would recover or to what extent.
It was a Titanic job, but I recovered completely, I learned to go again, and today I practice agility!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
A health pump advertisement that compares women to cows divides public opinion into online environment
A health pumping company has caused the division of public opinion into the online environment with an ad comparing mothers who are breast-feeding with cows.
To mark the launch of a pump that wants to be "the first silent and portable health pump in the world", the consumer technology company Elvie launched an ironic advertisement, inspired by a music video, to present the freedom the new pump offers to breast-feeding mothers.
Four real moms dance in a cow-fun barn on a song that includes verses such as: "Yes, I bow, but I don't have a tail" and "if you haven't noticed, they're not snakes, they're my breasts."
The refrigeration continues: "I pump, pump, breast-feed, pump, pump, extract milk from girls."
However, the claim, published on the company's Facebook page, raised controversy in the online environment.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video was targeted at mixed reactions from those who viewed it, many of them declaring it to be "orori" from the dairy industry.
"It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must remain pregnant and be born to produce milk, except that children are stolen only a few days after birth," wrote one person.
Elvie’s breast pump is discreetly suited to a nursing device (Elvie/Mamma)
Another person commented: “It is understandable how traumatic it is for both mother and child.
Of course, why not use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another added: "An extremely inappropriate claim."
Other people have defended claims, a person claiming that he had a "hilar" claim.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd have bought one if I was still breast-feeding.
The pumping really made me feel like a joke.
The ad is a bit inappropriate, but I took it as such.
But the product is great," wrote one person.
Another person commented: “It’s a fun commercial targeting mothers who use the pump (usually at work or in the toilet) and who feel like “the rabbits”.
It's not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they danced with discreet pumps introduced into the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who use the blood pump say they feel like rabbits.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and is discreetly fit into a feeding support, offering women freedom of movement, the possibility to keep their children in their arms and even get out of the city while using the pump.
Ana Balarin, a partner, consultant and developer in design at Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves such a bold and challenging launch.
Comparing breast-feeding mothers and milk cows, we wanted to highlight what it means to use a breast pump and the challenges in this regard, presenting, in a fun and real way, the incredible sense of freedom that will give the new pump.
It's not the first time the Elvie pump gets to the first page.
During the presentation of fashion designer Marta Jakubowski at the London Fashion Week, on the podium the mother of two children appeared while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been smuggled into a refugee camp from the border with Texas
The number of migrant children detained has increased, although the number of persons crossing the border each month has remained relatively the same, largely because rhetoric and the harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration have resulted in the increase in the child placement procedure in sponsors.
Many sponsors are usually themselves immigrants without documents and are afraid that they will endanger their country's residence if they ask to take children.
Risks increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors, as well as other adult family members, should register their fingerprints and that their data would be communicated to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Customs and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency had arrested ten people who had requested the sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal history.
"Approximately 80% of people who are sponsors or family members of sponsors live illegally in the country, and most of them are foreign offenders.
Which means we will continue to look for those individuals," Albence said.
In order to speed up the process of child processing in the system, the authorities have introduced new rules that require children to be brought before the court for a month of detention, and not for 60 days as required by the previous standard, according to the shelter employees.
Many will plead for the case by means of a video call, not personally in front of an immigration judge, to apply for legal residency status.
Those who are not considered eligible will be deported immediately.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more they can become restless or depressed, which can lead to violent or attempted escape, according to the system's employees' shelters and reports over the past few months.
Advocates stated that these concerns are highlighted in a larger unit, such as Tornillo, where there is a possibility of signs indicating that a child has problems that are not observed due to the size of the unit.
They added that transferring children to the refugee camp without providing them enough time for emotional preparation or to take good care of their friends might cause them trauma, which many of them already suffer.
Syria requires the US, French and Turkish military forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem asked Syrian refugees to return home, although Syria has been in war for eight years.
Moualem, who is also interim prime minister, said that foreign military forces are in an illegal Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism and that "the situation will be properly managed".
"This must be withdrawn immediately and without condition," he said in the meeting.
Moualem stressed that "the war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions of people have been displaced from their homes.
It further stated that Damascus will continue "this sacred battle until we remove terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence from all Syrian territories".
There are about 2,000 military troops in Syria in the United States, which are particularly involved in training and advising the Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
There are also over 1,000 French military troops in the war-torn country.
With regard to the refugee problem, Moualem said that there are conditions conducive to their return and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears", which led refugees to stay away.
He added: "I have requested the support of the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return".
"There are political influences in a problem that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have issued warnings that they will not support reconstruction in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war.
United Nations diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a demilitarised zone in the Idlib region to extend the last group of rebels has created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has contributed to the prevention of a large-scale attack by the Russian forces, supported by the Russians, on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action will target the jihadist groups, including those on the Nusra front, who are linked to the Al-Qaeda network and who "will be eradicated".
The Joint Staffman, the United Nations envoy, hopes to soon meet at a first meeting of a new committee formed by members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem presented the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, stating that the Committee's activities should be limited to "revision of the current constitution" and issued an interference warning.
Why will Trump win the second term
If we were to follow this logic, Trump would be real in 2020, unless the procedure for deposing or scandals would end its term of office earlier, which a large part of the liberal hearing hopes to happen.
In this case, there would no doubt be "the most dramatic final of a presidential term at all times!"
So far, it seems that the audience is still interested in the subject.
Since 2014, first-time hearings have doubled to CNN, reaching 1.05 million and almost tripled to MSNBC, reaching 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, in the early days, Fox News television station was followed on average by 2.4 million people, four years ago when it was followed by 1.7 million, and the broadcast "The Rachel Maddow Show" by MSNBC recorded a record of audiences, with 3.5 million people who followed it in the series where important news was broadcast.
"This is a subject that attracts the public, because we cannot understand it," said Neal Baer, the producer of the drama series "Chairman of Reserve" from ABC, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol building.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer with extensive experience in the field and the autoraggio of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has another theory.
She remembers a taxi trip through Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote with Trump.
Why? She asked.
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
In chaos, entertainment is valued.
Of course, unlike anything else broadcast on TV, Washington's action could determine the future of the Roe versus Wade case, if immigrant families can also be whole about the state of the global economy.
Exchange of posts is a luxury that can only be allowed by the privileged public.
However, you are not only an informed citizen when you arrive at the sixth hour of the debate by a committee of experts on the way Bob Woodward uses deep background sources for his book, Fair, about Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather jacket ("an object of opulent clothing", according to The Washington Post) and the shocking experiences of Stormy Daniels on Trump's "anatomical parts".
For example, I'll never look at Super Mario the same way.
"A large part of what it does gives you the feeling that you look at a reality show and feed you with subjects every night," said Brent Montgomery, the executive director of the Media Group Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of the show "Asi Amaneta", about the constantly changing distribution and the daily developments caused by Trump (the launch of a football competition with the American professional league, the songs brought to Kim Jong-Un).
Don't let yourself lose an episode, because you'll feel like you're behind.
When I went to visit Mike Fleiss this week in his home on the northern coast of the island of Kauai, there were 27 degrees and there was the sun, and he was sitting inside looking at MSNBC and recording CNN.
He could not get out of the TV, especially while Brett Kavanaugh was going to face the Senate's legal commission and he was going to decide on the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember performing some of the shows that came out of the community in the past, and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they seemed to be right."

Complementary external financial resources for the narrowest interim elections associated with the House of Representatives
As a result of a realisation of the electoral districts, resulting in two mandate holders in an electoral course for the same function, it is no surprise that the 17th electoral district of the state of Pennsylvania enjoys complementary financial resources.
Thus, the new suburb of Pittsburgh district has won Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won, in another district, the special elections last spring.
Lamb is running against another mandate holder in the exercise, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now the 12th electoral district of the state of Pennsylvania, which overlaps significantly with the 17th.
The electoral maps were reconfigured after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were not constitutional, and that the limits of the districts were manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The 17th new electoral district's race launched a competition to finance campaigns between important party funding agencies, the Congressional Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in special elections, with a maximum hearing, which took place in March for the 18th electoral district of the state of Pennsylvania.
For over a decade the function was occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won in this district with a difference of 20 points.
According to political commentators, democracies enjoy an easy advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for its understanding with China, but then gave up
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a welcome meeting with the President of the Republic of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until the partners evacuated the management team of the Trump Organisation.
Officials of the Department of State decided to call the heads of the diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama as a result of "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan," said Heather Naurut, the spokesman of the department in a statement earlier this month.
However, only sanctions have been imposed against El Salvador, which received US aid worth approximately $140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including reductions in financial assistance and visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and crime rate.
As internal meetings have made progress, officials in North America and Central America have delayed a high-level conference, focused on security and economic prosperity, to continue a similar meeting last year, considered a step forward in the efforts to prevent migration to the United States.
But by mid-September, officials from the front of the administration made it clear that they wanted to continue the conference, effectively ending any examination of the sanctions for El Salvador.
It is now planned for Vice-President Mike Pence to address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to highlight the importance of the administration giving the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without receiving any new messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for the White House for John Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions only if the anonymity is maintained.
Their reports were corroborated by an external analyst, who is a close member of the administration and who also spoke with the condition of keeping the anonymity.
History study
The next thing that could happen is the report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, about which there is now solid public evidence.
It also appears that Mueller is also guiding the investigation into the existence of a conspiracy between the Trump and Russia campaign in relation to the attack on American elections.
If the Congress changes, Trump will face the appropriate responsibility within the body, even when preparing to appear before the electorate and possibly a jury formed from his colleagues.
There are many possible situations and I do not want to suggest that Trump's "fall" is inevitable, also valid for its counterparts in Europe.
There are choices that we must all make, on the one hand, and on the other, of the Atlantic and that will decide the duration of the investigation.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to give a coup d'état against Hitler, only if the West had opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
I failed and thus lost the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on such critical moments, and the inexhaustible march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans face some of these critical moments right now.
What are we gonna do if Trump gets Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since it was reported in this newspaper that last year this suggested the secret registration of the President and speculated on his incompatibility with the role of President.
Rosenstein said the Times report is wrong.
"How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh's new investigation requested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation with regard to Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct or if it is confirmed at the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the interim elections for a Congress that will take responsibility for Trump?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail, after the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew of Czechoslovakian origin who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial residence.
He survived, he emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, he sent me to light the candles of the Sabbath on the table with the magic.
With such an inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Player Graham Dorrans from the Rangers team is optimistic about the Rapid Vienna game
On Thursday, Rangers will be the host team for Rapid Vienna, knowing that victory in the match with the Austrians, after the impressive equality in Spain against the Villareal team from the beginning of the month, will put it on a strong position to qualify as a Group G of the European League.
An accident on the knees did not allow middleman Graham Dorrans to play this season up to 2-2 with Villareal, but he considers that the Rangers team can use this result in its advantage to achieve better performance.
"It was a good point for us, given that Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old player said.
"I started the game thinking we'd get a good result and win a point.
I guess we could have written it down at the end, but, in total, I think the equation was the right result.
I think they were better at first, and we noticed better at second.
Thursday, it'll be an important evening for Europe again.
With little luck we will get three points, but it will be a difficult match, because they have had a good result in the last game. However, with the support of the supporters, we will certainly feel and more motivated and we will have a positive result.
Last year was clearly a difficult one, taking into account my accidents and changes from the club, but the situation is better at the moment.
The team is good and the boys really like to be here; training also goes well.
Let us hope that we will continue, that we will leave behind the past season and that we will have good results."
Women have insomnia due to pension economies
Despite the fact that survey participants knew clearly how to care, few people talked to family members about this.
Approximately half of the people who participated in the study conducted by the nationwide company said they were discussing the cost of long-term care with the husband/wife.
Only 10% of them said they talked to their children about the subject.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but do not initiate this conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Company.
Here's how you can start.
Discuss with your husband/wife and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide the care you need if you do not know your wishes from time to time.
Work with the advisor and the family to discuss the place and how you will be cared for, as these choices could be a significant factor for cost-setting.
Involve the financial adviser: and the financial adviser can be a real help in terms of the payment of these expenses.
Your funding options for long-term care can include a standard long-term insurance policy, a mixed life insurance policy in cash, to help you cover these expenses or you can ensure your own well-being – to the extent that you have the money.
Develop legal documents: come into play with legal problems.
Get medical advice, to designate a trusted person to supervise your medical care and to ensure that professionals in the field respect your wishes if you cannot communicate them.
Also take into account the implementation of a mandate with regard to your financial resources.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that you get the facts, if you do not have the necessary ability to do so.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that a parent of yours with a previous age has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about his medicines and allergies?
Note these details in a written plan to be prepared.
“And it’s not just about the financial side. Can you tell who the doctors are dealing with it?” Martin asked.
"What are the medicines?
Who's gonna take care of his dog?
Draw up a plan on all these things."
A man was shot several times with a compressed-air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a compressed-air rifle as he went home after a night in the city.
The victim, aged 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the incident, which took place at 02:30 p.m., as "shooting at random".
The victim couldn't see his attacker.
The wounded don't put his life in danger, and the police have called witnesses to make statements.
Storms and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died because of a severe earthquake and tsunami that struck the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, according to the authorities, and the number of deaths is expected to increase.
Due to the disruption of the communications networks, the disaster authorities were unable to obtain any information from the Dongala kingdom, an area in the north of Palu, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter with a magnitude of 7.5 degrees on Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key information about Palu and Dongala from the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of the centre of the island of Sulawesi, which is at the end of a narrow golf course on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of approximately 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The holiday city was 40 years old when it was hit by tsunamis and earthquakes.
Dongala is a kingdom that lies on a coast with an area over 300 km north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, an administrative region located below a province, has a population of approximately 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture activities are the central point of the province's economy in the centre of the island of Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Mining activities for the extraction of nickel are also important in the province, but are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of the island of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesia Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami caused the death of more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
Also in 1996, a tsunami struck the western part of Dongala Regency, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Circle, an area with intense seismic activity.
Here are some of the earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, north of the island of Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, causing the death of 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half being from Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of the island of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of the island of Sumatra.
2006: a 6.8-degree earthquake on Richter scale hit the southernmost popular Indonesian island, Java, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: a 7.6-degree earthquake on Richter scale took place near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Sumatra de West.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: a 7.5-degree earthquake on Richter scale hit one of the Mentawai islands, off the coast of the island of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters, which destroyed ten villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: a low-intensity earthquake occurred in the Pidie Jaya kingdom of Aceh, causing damage and panic, as people remembered the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004, which was fought with a large number of deaths.
This time a tsunami did not start, but more than 100 people died because of the collapsed buildings.
2018: several powerful earthquakes occurred on the tourist island of Lombok, causing the death of more than 500 people, most on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily blocked under damage.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested after domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested following allegations of violence.
Palin, aged 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, being involved in a domestic violence claim and in opposition to arrest, according to a report published Saturday by Alaskan policemen.
According to the police report, when a woman's knowledge of sex tried to call the police to claim alleged crimes, he got her phone.
Palin is in police custody at Mat-Su unit, awaiting the trial, and is held on the basis of a security-free guy, worth $500, according to KTUU.
It was presented on Saturday in court, where it was declared "100% innocent" when it was requested by the network.
Palin faces three charges of Class A crimes, which means he could be imprisoned for up to one year and fined with $250,000.
They were also charged with a class B offence, which is punishable by a day in prison and an amendment of $2,000.
This isn't the first time Palin's been brought such charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to announce alleged aggression.
The case is under trial at the Alaska Veterinary Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, engaging in a complaint of a domestic violence offence and holding a weapon while in a state of drunkenness in connection with an incident.
According to his lover's statement, he put a bullet in his face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by the veteran groups in 2016 after her son's violent behavior was associated with the post-traumatic stress syndrome he suffered after being a member of Iraqi military forces.
Disasters and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake on Richter scale triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
The electricity and telecommunications networks are broken and it is expected that the number of deaths will increase in the next few days.
The earthquake took place outside the central province of Sulawesi, located in the northeastern Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Video clips that present the moment of impact are circulated on socialisation networks.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the coast.
The federal prosecution wants a capital punishment for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
The New York federal prosecution wants a capital punishment for Sayfillo Saipov, a suspect of a terrorist attack in New York City after which eight people were killed, a rare penalty that was no longer applied in the state for a 1953 federal offence.
It appears that Saipov, 30 years old, used a rented truck Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle track from the West Side motorway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on his journey in October.
In order to justify the capital punishment, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intendedly" killed the eight victims and "intendedly" caused serious bodily injuries, according to the intentional opinion on the request of the capital penalty, filed in the South District of New York.
Both of the defendants may receive a capital sentence according to the court's documents.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury accused Saipov of 22 counts of charges involving eight counts of crime in support of organised crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, as well as a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack needed "substantial planning and pre-medication", the prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed the act as "hate, cruel and devious".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, suffering and loss to the families and friends of the following people: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," according to the opinion.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last trial of a case of capital punishment in the South District of New York.
The priest, Khalid Barnes, was charged with murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last capital punishment imposed in a federal case in New York was held in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two husbands executed after being convicted of conspiracy on the commission of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Rosenberg's husbands were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed no regret in the days and months following the attack.
He confessed to the investigators that he liked what he did, according to the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he felt inspired to execute the attack after watching the videos of the ISIS group on his phone, according to the requester.
Also, according to the police, he asked to build the ISIS flag in the hospital room.
He pleaded as innocent with regard to the 22nd head of the charge.
David Patton, one of the defenders in Saipov's office, said they are "evidently disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to apply the capital penalty, instead of accepting a life imprisonment plea, without any possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked the prosecutors not to apply the capital punishment.
A member of Parliament who is part of the Conservative Party argues that NIGEL FARAGE must be in the forefront of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today that he would "mobilise the civilian army" during a protest at the Conservative Party's conference.
Ukip's former leader said politicians must "sympathize" with Eurosceptics, following a statement by Parliament member Theresa May that suggested that it should be in the forefront of negotiations with the European Union.
Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative Party, said at a demonstration in Birmingham that the United Kingdom "would have left" until now if Farage was Secretary of Brexit's campaign.
However, the challenge that May faces with regard to the extremely divided camps was stressed by the members of the Conservative Party who joined another protest against the European Union's city-run exit.
The Prime Minister is trying to ensure that his plan of compromise, called the Chequers Plan, is properly carried out in the face of attacks by those who support the abandonment of the European Union, those who want to remain in it, as well as by the European Union.
The Alliances stressed that it would continue to try to conclude an agreement with Brussels, no matter what the consequences, and would force the Eurosceptic and Labour Party to choose between its offer and its "haos".
Bone said in the event of the Pro-Brexit Movement "Leave Means Leave" in Solihull that he wanted "resignation to the Chequers plan".
He suggested that Farage should be a member of the team and that the associated responsibility be given to the Brussels negotiations.
"If things were led by him, I was no longer in the European Union," he said.
The Conservative Member of Parliament, the representative of Wellingborough, added: "I will support Brexit, but we must give up the Chequers plan."
Referring to his opposition to the European Union, he said: "I have not fought in world wars to be servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the suggestions for changing public opinion to vote in 2016: "It is not at all true that the British have changed and that they want to remain in the Union."
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party that supports Brexit, was also at the demonstration and told reporters: "I only want to say this: Prime Minister, listen to the voices of people.
"The public disagrees with the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it, our party disagrees with it and our activists who go out in the street and who support us, first and foremost, in the elections.
Give up the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message targeting Theresa May, it added: "The prime ministers who keep their function are those who keep their promises."
During the meeting, Nigel Farage said politicians should be put in a position to "sympathize" if they are about to give up the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"It's a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"Try to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them that "we will not let them do this".
In a message sent to the enthusiastic thank you, he added: “I want you to help us put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
"We mobilize the civilian army of the country that has brought us victory in Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-governed and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those who support the stay in the European Union marched through Birmingham two hours before a meeting in the city centre.
A small group of activists raised banners that they wrote "The Conservative Party is against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at the members of the Conservative Party and the security problems they faced in applying the party at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can implement IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, to digitise customs procedures, for free and unrestricted trade in Ireland," he added.
"It's a farce.
Brexit doesn't bring any benefits," he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider running for the presidency
Senator Elizabeth Warren of the United States said he would seriously think of running for the presidency after the November elections.
According to the Boston Globe newspaper, the Democratic Senator of Massachusetts spoke Saturday about her future during a summit in the western state of Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for the November elections against Geoff Diehl, a member of the House of Representatives of the Republican Party, who has been co-chair of Donald Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It was at the centre of speculation that could defeat Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was a meeting with the number 36 citizens with the right to vote using the primary format since Trump took over as president.
One participant asked her if she was going to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time has come for women to "come to Washington to solve the problems of our badly affected government, and this includes a woman in front of him".
A suspect was arrested in the case of a death that caused the death of the player Sims from the LSU team
The Baton Rouge police, Los Angeles, announced Saturday that a suspect had been arrested in the case of a dead man who caused the death of the basketball player Wayde Sims from LSU on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced Diteon Simpson's arrest at a press conference at 11:00.
They published a video material at the time of Friday's shooting, asking for help in identifying the man in the images.
Sims, aged 20, was shot and killed near the campus at Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head, causing his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul said Saturday for 247 sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was in front of the place, that he was in possession of a gun, but that he also shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and was taken to police custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a junior player, with a height of 1.98 m, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 matches, being 10 times in the first round in the last season and playing on average 17.4 minutes with 5.6 points and 2.9 recoveries on the matches.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after his team helps him win in front of Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the time that Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton Saturday that the Mercedes team's orders will play an essential role in the race.
Located in the first position in the class, Bottas had a good start and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two tours and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to stop the box and left Hamilton at the group's tail, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes stopped at the box a while later and came behind Vettel, but Hamilton managed to move forward after several schemes that forced Ferrari driver to leave the inside free after making a double move to defend himself at the third turn.
Max Verstappen started the race in the back of the carriage and was in place almost seven at the end of the first tour, even on the day he was 21 years old.
Then he stood in the front for a large part of the race, looking at a quick finish and trying to cross Kimi Raikkonen and take the place four.
Finally, he stopped at the 44th tour, but couldn't increase his pace in the last eight tours, while Raikkonen remained in four.
“It was a difficult day. Valtteri did an exceptional job all weekend and behaved like a true gentleman, letting me go ahead.
And the team did an excellent job to win in front of the Ferraris and to achieve this double," Hamilton said.
A Terrible Body Language
President Donald Trump ironed Senator Diana Feinstein on Saturday, in a meeting on his own insistences as if she did not facilitate the "run-off" of Christine Blasey Ford's letters, which accused Brett Kavanaugh, nominated at the Supreme Court, of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Judicial Committee, commenting instead that what is happening in the Senate has shown that people are "wicked, immoral and lying".
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that is happening in the last days in the Senate, when you see a mania, when you see people who are angry and wicked and immoral and lying," he said.
"When you see that they published and published information and then they say they didn't.
They're not the ones responsible.
Do you remember?
When did I ask Diane Feinstein if she made it easier to "run" the document?
Do you remember her answer?
Uh... no.
I didn't do that."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we do this? No, I didn't," he added, imitating the senators.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and was "successed" in September, but Feinstein denied that the "run" occurred from her office.
"I didn't hide the charges that concern Ford and I'm not the one that facilitated the "flow" of her report," Feinstein told the commission, according to Hill newspaper.
"He asked me to keep my privacy and that's exactly what I did."
But her denial does not seem to have touched the president, who commented during the Saturday meeting: “Being honest, it was a horrible body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the most horrible body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that democrats use the charges to achieve their own ends.
“They are determined to take power in any way possible.
Notice the evil, immorality, they don't care who I hurt and who I have to destroy in order to get power and control," the president said, according to the Media site.

An air traffic controller died after securing the decommissioning of a plane with hundreds of passengers during a earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero, dying after he secured the decommissioning of a plane with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
There were several powerful replicas in the area and many people are blocked under the remains of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, Antonio Gunawan Agung, aged 21, refused to leave his post at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport checkpoint in Palu, which woke up heavily.
It remained in place to ensure that the 6321 Batik Air flight, which was on the track at that time, would take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the air control tower when he noticed he was about to crash.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesperson of the Indonesian air navigation service provider said it is possible to save hundreds of lives according to ABC News Australia.
I've prepared a helicopter to transport it from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a larger hospital from another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"We are suffering from this news," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands, the national disaster management agency declaring that access is limited in the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong.
"We believe that the number will increase, because many victims are still in ruins and we have not had access to many of them," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves of a height of up to six meters devastated the city of Palu on Sunday to hold a common funeral.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, an ambulance brings victims.
It's almost impossible to find drinking water.
All the mini-arkets are stolen."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is quick to offer help to survivors, but we do not know what they will find in front of the site.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: "Please work day and night to complete all evacuation operations.
Are you ready?", announced CNN.
Indonesia was shaken at the beginning of this year's earthquake in Lombok, who fought with more than 550 deaths.
Aerial accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that a person is missing after a plane crashed into a lagoon
The airline holding the plane that crashed into a Pacific Ocean lagoon in Micronesia has now declared that a person is missing, after previously stated that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger is missing from the afternoon of Saturday.
This mentioned above that he is trying to find the man, along with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The air carrier did not respond immediately to requests for additional details on the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were used to recover the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
On Friday, the authorities said seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed at the hospital on Saturday and that they were all stable.
It is not yet known what caused the accident and the exact order of events.
The United States airline and the United States Naval Forces have said that the plane has missed the landing track and has reached a lagoon beyond it.
Some witnesses think the plane crossed the end of the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had reached a very small distance from the ground.
"It's a very good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes also said that he and other passengers managed to cross the water, which reached the bridge, and get to the emergency exits of the plane that sank.
He said that the shipmates panicked and yelled and that he suffered a minor head wound.
The U.S. Naval Forces said that the sailors working close to renewing a deshiper jumped in aid, using a flammable boat to transport people to the shore before the plane sinks 30 meters below the water.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in accidents of a company registered in PNG for the last two decades, but none of them included an aircraft from Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor's office closed his plea regarding the resumption of the trial for a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in the information analysis.
He presented to the jury the way he used his cell phone records to get Quinton Tellis's actions, at age 29, as well as his victim Jessica Chambers, at age 19, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, this being in contradiction with his previous statements, according to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.
The moment the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was called in the witness box and testified he wasn't in town that day.
When the procurators asked Tellis if he had told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "a liar, because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistencies was that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone records indicate they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that, shortly after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted text messages, calls and contact data from Chambers from his phone.
"He deleted it from his life," Hale said.
According to the time limit, the defense will begin its final plea Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to decide at the end of that day.
The High Breed: what is the hip-hop conscious?
A trio that sings hip-hop music wants to change the negative way in which this kind of music is seen, with the help of positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, argues that the hip-hop stopped transmitting political messages and dealing with social problems, as it did at the outset.
They want to return to their origins and make the hip-hop conscious to be popular again.
A recent rebirth of artists such as The Refugees and Common in the United Kingdom was observed through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another person of color?!
A New York Dating gives a couple in court for dismissing her after she received a text message "racist"
A New York Dating gives a couple in court for discriminating reasons after having received, wrongly, a text message from her mother, in which she complained that it was "another person of color".
The couple refused to be racist, claiming that she had been tried for "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, the mother of two children, expressed her dissatisfaction when she learned that the new donor, Giselle Maurice, was of color, when she presented herself on the first day of work in 2016.
"NOUUUUUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing that she felt embarrassed, Plasco-Faxman dismissed Maurice, claiming that her father-in-law, who is an African-American, did not fulfill his duties properly and that she was expected to receive a donation of Filipino nationality, according to New York Post.
Maurice was paid for the day of work and sent home with Uber.
Now, she gives the couple in court to pay them compensation for dismissal and asks for a sum of 350 dollars a day for six months, the period in which they had to live with them and carry out their business, despite the fact that this is done without a contract concluded.
"I want to show them that they don't do such things," she said to the Post newspaper Friday, adding, "I know it's about discrimination."
The couple denied the claims that they were racist, saying it was a normal thing to fire Maurice, because they feared that I could no longer trust her after she was stabbed.
"My wife sent him the wrong message.
She's not a racist person.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco, her husband, for the Post newspaper.
"But will you leave your children on the hands of a person you have made a mistake with, even if you have made a mistake?
The newborn child?
Let's be serious."
Considering the process an "extortion" action, Plasco said that his wife would be born in two months and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
“Do you really want to avenge a person in such circumstances?
Don't do that," the bank investor added.
While the process is under way, the public opinion has accused the couple of socializing networks, judging them for the behavior and logic they have demonstrated.
Paddington's story editors feared that readers would not be able to identify themselves with a bear who spoke, according to a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said the following about the letter: “It’s hard to get into the skin of a person who reads it for the first time before it’s published.
It's very funny now, after I saw that Paddington had a huge success."
It further stated that his father, who was a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a toy bear to write the book for children, would have been optimistic about rejecting his work, adding that the anniversary of the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was a "sweet-sweet-sweet" after he died last year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", she added that her father had a discreet pride about the success he later enjoyed.
"He was a man quite calm and he didn't like to praise himself," she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child who had a success: you’re proud of him, although it’s not yours.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation, based on his imagination, he always used to give Paddington the credit."
My daughter was dying and I had to pick up my phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was transported quickly to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"It often calls to tell me that it is very serious and that it does not think it will survive," Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I received a call from Nad telling me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to take a good-bye from her
And that's exactly what I did.
I said to him, "Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of medications administered to keep her heart pumping blood on her body began to decrease and get out of her body.
Murise a little while ago and the organs began to work out.
I had to stay there and wait, aware of everything that's going on.
I couldn't scream or scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I was supposed to be in control."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, grieving after the death of his daughter, boarded the plane, along with other passengers, who did not know what he was going through.
"No one knows," she said.
“I kept my head down and tears kept running.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I had a overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
I realized he needed love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her."
Two grieving women place various messages on a bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones because they committed suicide try to prevent other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place various messages on a bridge in Wales, many of them being motivational and including phone numbers people can call to get support.
Sharon Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel as I feel every day," she said.
Davis, 45 years old, lives in Lydney and says his son was supposed to be a promising cook with a mollusk smile.
"Everyone appreciates his smile.
They always said his smile would change your mood."
However, he gave up his job before he died because he had reached a very unhappy moment in his life.
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his brother after he took his life.
Davis said, "I'm still thinking you'll have a domino effect."
This created the messages “to convey to people that I can call someone or that I can talk to someone, even a friend.
Exterior yourself, you need to talk to someone."
Kelly Humphreys, Davies' most longtime friend, lost Mark, the life partner he had for 15 years, just a short time since his mother died.
"She didn't tell me she wasn't feeling well or she was depressed," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, I noticed that her attitude changed.
She was in a deplorable state on Christmas Day, when the children gave their gifts and she didn't even look them in the eye."
She said that his death was a major trauma to them, but she had to overcome it: “He caused a lot of pain within the family.
We're devastated.
But we have to go further and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as a result of the start of the investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
"I thought that if we could get something similar to what he was asking – an investigation into a limited period of time and limited scope – we could have a little unity," Jeff Flake said Saturday, adding that he is afraid that the Commission is about to "disengage", on the basis of a partisan blockade.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their retrieval is due to the full time factor.
It is only five weeks before the November 6th elections - if, as is expected, the Republicans have bad results, their attempts to place the one they want the winner at the elections for the country's highest court will be significantly weak.
George W. Bush always called the senators to convince them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the Bush White House and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI finalizes the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, Vice-President, to make the difference in the case of equality and to confirm it at the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea falls under Kim's leadership
The number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong came to power seven years ago, a South Korean MP said.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Ministry of Integration of South Korea, said last year they fled from the country about 1,127 people, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said key factors were stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates perceived by those who carry illegal persons across the border.
The phenist made no public comment.
A large majority of the refugees from the North are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
The officers in Seoul declare that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the illegal border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
The most fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two parts of Korea.
China considers refugees to be more illegal migrants than refugees and is often forced to return.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still in practice in the war, have improved significantly over the past few months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Phenian for a few discussions that had been the subject of negotiations on denuclearisation.
This took place after the historic meeting between American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un of Singapore, when they agreed, in general terms, to cooperate for a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the US sanctions of missing progress since.
"If we can't trust the United States, we can't trust our national security and, in such a situation, we won't be the first to be unilaterally disappointed," Ri said in a speech addressed to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as "historic", declaring that he is unable to serve at the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the democratic minority in the House of Representatives, described Brett Kavanaugh, nominated at the Supreme Court as "historic", and said his temper was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made comments on Saturday during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't think of the fact that if there was a woman in this situation, she would have been declared "historic," Peloso said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's legal commission, which took place on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the charges that Christine Blasey Ford would be sexually harassed when they were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost screamed and lost his voice because of his emotions, while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned democrats in the commission, calling charges against him "a grotesque and coordinated murder of character", organised by angry liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelos said it is of the opinion that Kavanaugh's testimony has demonstrated that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court, because he has shown himself to be a partisan against the Democrats.
"I believe he is disqualified by those statements and by the way he attacked the Clinton family and democracies," she said.
Pelosi deviated from the subject when it was asked whether he would try to suspend Kavanaugh if it was confirmed and whether the democracies would win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I just want to say this: if it doesn't tell the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then it's not appropriate, not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court in which it is now," Pelosi said.
At present, Kavanaugh is a judge at the Court of Appeal of the District of Columbia.
Pelos added that, as a democrat, he is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Law accessible to care or in the case of Roe versus Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh ignored the question whether it would reverse certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not the right time for a wife, partner, to go to court and expect us to say, 'Wow! what a great thing!'," said Pelosi.
And women must be able to handle it.
It's a legitimate diatritus, it's months and years of accumulated anger and can't talk without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do I?"
She continued: “I received significant help from a woman who was carrying on an executive role, who told me that she was crying when she was nervous, but that she developed a technique that, when she was angry and started to cry, she told the person she was talking to: “You might think I’m sad because you see me complaining.
I'm nervous."
And then it goes on.
I thought it was a great thing."
Tears are allowed to exacerbate anger, partly because they are fundamentally wrong.
One of the clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in an office dominated by men, where I began to cry because of an unexpressable rage, is that I was taken by the head of an older woman, a cold manager to whom I always felt a little afraid, and took me home on the stairs.
"She should never see you complaining," she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
I think you're sad and they'll be glad they caused you this feeling."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat in Colorado State Congress, worked with Gary Hart at the presidential elections.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Schroeder, extremely frustrated, thought he had no reason why she should not run for the presidency herself.
"It wasn't a very well thought-out decision," she says laughing, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone referred to the situation as "White as Snow and the Seven Drinks".
Because the campaign was in the end, she was behind the fundraising and swore she won't be in the race if she can't get $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
He found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men, they only gave $250.
"Do they think I'm getting reductions?" she asked.
During the speech in which he announced that he would not officially launch a company, he was so affected by emotions – due to the appreciation for the people who supported it, the frustration caused by the system and the fact that it was so difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, but also the anger caused by gender discrimination – that he lost his voice due to emotions.
"You would have said I have a nervous crisis," Schroeder recalls about the press' reactions to it.
"You would have said one of my sponsors is Kleinex."
I remember thinking about what they're gonna write on my funeral stone.
"Did she cry?"
How can the trade war between the United States and China be beneficial for Beijing?
Saves who announced the start of the trade war between the United States and China were absurd and, although it seems to be still a long way to its end, disputes between the two countries could be beneficial for long-term Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, issued the first warning early this year by imposing taxes on key imports from China, including solar, steel and aluminium panels.
The most important escalation took place this week with new taxes, which affected products worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds sterling), applying, in effect, taxes for half of all the goods from China that reach the United States.
Beijing has retaliated every time, most recently imposing a tax of between 5% and 10% for American products worth $60 billion.
China has warned that it will respond to every hit by the United States and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will take a step back in the near future.
In order for Washington to withdraw, China must agree with its demands, but public surrender to the United States would be too humiliating for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing were to play its books well, the U.S. pressure on the trade war could positively support China in the long term, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision taken in Washington or in Beijing could lead to an economic downturn in both countries would in fact be more dangerous than what has been proposed so far," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a group of experts.
Syria is ready to return refugees, Minister for Foreign Affairs says
Syria claims to be prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild a devastated country by a war that lasts for better seven years.
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's situation is improving.
"Today, the conditions in front of the site are more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists so things can get back to normal.
The existing conditions allow the voluntary return of refugees to the country in which they were required to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at daily life and their lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians fled the country in 2011, when the war broke out.
Six million people who continue to live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be pleased to receive assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or assistance from countries sponsored by the insurgency would not be accepted.
European team wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder 2018 Cup after winning the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National from the edge of Paris, France.
The United States has now recorded the sixth consecutive victory in Europe and has no longer won the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe returned first after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn got 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who made incredible efforts in most of the tournament, sent the ball from the initial water hit to the hair 3 at the 16th hole, surrendering his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has had an incredible performance in all the reviews, becoming one of the four players with a result of 5-0-0 since there is the current format of the tournament, from 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost at Gates 5 and 4 in front of the player from the last place in the European team ranking, Thorbjorn Olesen in Denmark.
The first player in the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost at holes 2 and 1 in front of Ian Poulter in England, which is probably his last match in the Ryder Cup.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, who participated in eight editions, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the player in Europe with most victories, recording an average of 25.5 points throughout his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t stop today.
It was a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm extremely happy that I could win the cup again.
It is a teamwork and I am glad that I could be of help," said Garcia, excitedly after the European victory.
He teaches his Conaional staff, John Ram, who beat Tiger Woods, an American golf legend, at holes 2 and 1, on a Sunday, individual game.
"I am very proud that I beat Tiger Woods. I used to follow the games when I was a child," said Rahm, aged 23.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds a 13-21-3 record at the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 important titles, being surpassed only by Jack Nicklus.
All weekend, the American team made a real effort on the golf course, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played amazingly throughout the whole tour.
The captain of the American team, Jim Furyk, said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I’m proud of them, they’ve done their best.
This morning, there were a few moments when I put pressure on the European team.
I've had a hard fight.
Down the hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
I'll work with PGA of America and our Committee for the Ryder Cup and we'll go further.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be captain.
We have to give them proper respect.
They played better than us."
