Food due to European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation in the euro area is the rapidly increasing food prices.
In the 13 eurozone countries, the price was higher than expected in November - after 2.6 per cent in October an annual inflation rate of 3.1 per cent was recorded, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are only 3 percent out, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the United States, British and Canadian notary banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced its leadership. According to their estimates, the decline would benefit the rising commodity prices and the slight decline in unemployment from the creation of an inflation spiral.
The ECB aims to keep the inflation rate below two percent, or at least less on the two-percent mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in the target mill: inflation has to be "confirmed" in order to rule out the need for action later.
By 3.3 percent, the rate of inflation reached a 12-year-old record in Germany in November; in Spain, the rate rose from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The increased food and energy prices are responsible for the rise in inflation in the euro area.
The MATIF score increased by 88 percent, and the Soybean course has also reached a record level since 1973.
Also in the case of food oil and milk products, there was a significant price increase in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil increased by 52 percent this year - last month the price reached almost 100 US dollars per round of gold.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 per cent in 2008, but it is estimated that 2009 will fall to 1.9 per cent.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts will figure out a 3-percent inflation rate, but the annual average rate will be 2.1 per cent.
For 2008, experts estimate that the ECB will double the interest rate.
Gallup Location of Government Crisis
After long stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathians has grown significantly by the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has had the largest base camp, while the consent for the Socialists according to Gallup has reached a never-ending depth of 13 percent.
In the case of party-reliable voters, the difference is clearly due to the high determination of opposition advocates: more than two thirds (71 per cent) are in favour of a fifth (20 per cent) of the MSZP.
The MDF and SZDSZ are surveyed under the parliamentary threshold: they come in the total population by two percent.
The number of party voters has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last point, the general economic mood continued to worsen - never before was the share of those who considered the country's economic situation to be "badly spoken" so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent considered it "very bad".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the next year, the majority of the population is counting on a further deterioration of the situation; only one tenth is expected to improve.
A Gallup survey conducted in December revealed that 71% of the respondents - a historical high - judged the Prime Minister's work as "bader than right".
Thirteen percent of the respondents have great confidence or trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the proportion of supporters for Viktor Orbán is 38 percent.
Around 54% do not trust the government chief at all, compared with 27% suspicions against the party leader of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the political mood is the number of those who think you could get the dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister even without any change in government.
If 35% of the government and the government's government remained after the riots in last October, this share is only 20% today, while the relative majority (33%) sees the solution only in the new elections.
Asked for their interest in the vote, 60 percent replied that they would "safety" and another 20% would "probably" vote.
Compared to this: if the parliamentary elections were to take place this Sunday, only 55 percent would go to the urns "safety", another 15% would consider their participation "probably". In view of these trends, the result of the vote would be negligible.
74% would vote against the study fees, 79% against the practice fees, and 84% against the hospital tagging.
Based on the group of participants in the "safety" vote, the percentages of respondents to the study, practice and hospital fees would be even 81, 84, or 89 percent.
Auchan at the most expensive, Tesco increases by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörser Trade Area have also maintained the average price increase of 16% last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Article from Napi Kaštág
The price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" also increased by 16 percent this year in the Budaörser Handelsdreich, however, price increases of more than 1,000 HUF were recorded in all hypermarkets.
After prices in the food markets have been "davongalupped" last December, the price has not declined significantly compared to the high, earlier level of output.
However, it certainly seems frightening to consumers that what they had paid for last year was not even available for 10,000 HUF.
The price of the "Napi" basket exceeds the magical 10,000-HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the investigated markets.
The highest price was 10,573 HUF.
(In 6,800 the price was 6,800 HUF.)
Prices for Unicum and living fish remained almost at the previous year's level, whereas prices for Putenbristfilets, Nuss and Mohn have risen sharply.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but at Auchan there were 1kg of bread for 139 Forint.
There was no competitive price distortion in the product at less than 200 Forint.
Also surprising was the price of two litres of Coca-Cola Pfand bottle of below 200 forint, so the drink including Pfand cost only 257 HUF.
Yet this year the "Napi" shopping cart compares Auchan with the most expensive, and Cora is the cheapest.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased the prices in the "Napi" shopping cart compared to the Christmas prices last year by 15, while Tesco and Auchan have increased 18 percent respectively.
The difference between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the most expensive of today's year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the most expensive item of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was 1.480,00 HUF.
The average price increase was still at 1,206.00 forint in the previous year, but the increase in value added tax at last Christmas prices was noticeable.
That is precisely what has been the case: it seems that the Houses of Commerce could not decide so correctly what price range they should apply to the individual articles, as the effects of the price increase on consumer behaviour were invisible.
(If the trader plans to run the speed of a product poorly, he may fall into the price range, which is based on the traffic intensity.)
The value of the "Napi" shopping cart fell so radically last year that the cheapest shopping cart exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, whereas the price difference in the cheapest shopping cart was only 844 Forint.
This year such extremes were not observed, as the cheapest basket cost more forint than in the previous year, and even at the cheapest, there was a price increase of 1.284.00 forint.
Compared with the last two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase was shown, with the price of daily consumer goods in the hypermarkets increased by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: In some basic foodstuffs, the Statistical Office established a price of more than 30 per cent over a 12-month period.
So in about beside flour also in eggs.)
However, if you take a look in the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems almost impossible at the latest, since the price level of the product already valued in the previous year has increased by almost 10 percent in the worst case.
Apparently, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the suppliers - at any rate, they were able to reduce the drastic price increase to the multis.
The hypermarkets do not complain in the golden trade triangle; it is reported in good times.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three stores are no longer looking at prices.
It is purchased from all large quantities, durable food goes into pallets across the Ladentic.
Wednesday morning morning there were endless snakes in all three commodity houses at the cash register, as the number of customers suddenly exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported from the country, so many multiples complain to opinion researchers that they could not even reach the planned turnover, not only for food, but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Many sites are saved by disinfectants
Today, more than a thousand infections have been reported in hospitals that were due to inappropriate treatment of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in hospitals, the overcrowding of beds, the overloading of staff - all factors that are not directly relevant to the ingestion of infections, so the leading physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Many sites are also saved by disinfectants.
In the traumatology department of the János Hospital, a MRSA infection was recently diagnosed.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was found in a male patient who was delivered to the hospital after a severe accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was already a similar infection.
The victim of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but shortly thereafter the man had to return with an MRSA infection. An important operation since then could not be carried out due to the bacteria still in the patient’s body.
Until 10 December this year, infections caused by multi-resistant agents have been reported from hospitals in 1094 to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, according to the leading physician of the National Epidemiology Centre, Karolina Böröcz.
So many multi-resistant infections were registered in hospitals with safety, but the number should be higher.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were caused by MRSA, which is resistant to methicillin-Oxacillin staphylococcus aureus.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria carry about one third of the people in their nose without causing a disease.
SA-conditional infections (such as throat inflammation, mandelinating, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well healed.
However, if the funds are too high or inappropriately used, they are produced from the well-responsive bacteria antibiotics that spread rapidly in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
Especially in patients with weak, or persistently poorly functioning immune system, but also in older patients, or patients with low body weight, these bacteria may cause serious infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of János Hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such events belong to the hospital every day.
You should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, warned Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA there is only no place where it is not sought.
Antibiotics Resistant
"Such patients are isolated, the nursing staff wear rubber gloves and masks when providing, and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Although patients are studied on MRSA when they are hospitalized, an infection cannot always be avoided.
Rare sampling
Most of the infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be preventable, but the conditions and circumstances currently prevailing would be unfavourable to slow down the emergence or spread of the multi-resistant aggravator, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should investigate the patients submitted and isolate MRSA infected immediately.
However, in Hungarian hospitals the microbiological sampling is not so often practised.
Not least because there are no subsidies for this investigation outside the State Hospital.
Most cases therefore come to light only when the patient has a significant MRSA infection, as the medical director of the epidemiology center.
On the other hand, there are strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also directives in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and disease images.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, that is to say, microbiological tests are necessary to prevent resistance to the drug, but this directive by hospitals is not always complied with.
Among the ambulances, or patients in primary care, microbiological sampling is even more rare, says Karolina Böröcz.
Saved in disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is transferred from one patient to the other most frequently by the nurse.
That is why the washing of hands or the wearing of gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant deficiencies in this area in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by drip infection or contact, but in home hospitals there is not always the possibility to isolate the infected patients.
The rooms are even often crowded, the beds are barely lined up, although there should be at least 1.5 meters between them from an epidemiological point of view.
Unfortunately, as Karolina Böröcz further notes, in the less financially well-off hospitals, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that directly favour infection.
Such infections are proven to be far less common there, or in relation to the further spread of the breeder, where these protective measures are observed, says Karolina Böröcz.
Government programme against MRSA
Get MRSA infections into the grip caused by sickness insurance costs enormously, so they are fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its suspension, was included in the government programme.
After first signs, the program is successful - as published data show, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declining.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has identified the prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals as one of its priorities.
The death linker police chief was not drunk
In the case of a car accident with a fatal outcome caused by the chief of police in the 21st district, the official opinion is now available.
Attila Morvai, the chief of police in the 21st district, who killed a pedestrian in a car accident on Tuesday, was neither alcoholized nor under drug influence, said the Budapest Supreme Court press spokesman on Friday after the official opinion was submitted.
The opinion confirmed the results of the initial investigation, which the chief of police had not consumed alcohol before taxing.
The former police chief moved with his own car in the XXII. District into the Kossuth Lajos Street and crossed over a 55-year-old man who crossed the road to an unmarked place.
(According to STVO, however, this is not a milder situation - the linker has, even though pedestrians do not cross the street at the zebra strip, afternoon.)
The pedestrian has suffered injuries after his entry to the hospital.
According to police reports, the linker suffered a shock, then returned his functions and sought retirement.
The Budapest State Prosecutor's Office has initiated its investigations into the case.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
More EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed three credit agreements worth EUR 400 million on Friday in Budapest.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental protection projects implemented with Cohesion Fund grants. The 100 million loan agreement was signed earlier, in which the current agreement concerns the use of the EUR 200 million granted.
The amount of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement is also to be applied to the budget financing of education projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary; the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later on in the context of the extension of the credit agreement.
In the field of innovation, the Contracting Parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will flow mainly in research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, the 4 subway came to play.
It was agreed that once Hungary has concluded the details of underground financing with the EU, the original contract and possible modifications will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects worth EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The loans are EURIBOR-bound, the loan is provided by the EIB with a delay of 8 years, free of commission.
Bulgaria, EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - Europe as a whole is looking at the previously seldom mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who buys the even cheaper market in the EU, but becomes more expensive quickly?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently undoubtedly the most desirable patch for real estate purchases in the Eastern European area, with cheap ski apartments and houses on the sea.
Between the mountains the regions of Bansko, Borovic, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, on the sea are Albena, the "golden coast", the "sun coast", and the historical towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the racers, but properties around Kavarna and Balcik are increasingly asked.
According to estimates by Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the country's economy is also attracting investors sooner or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, as well as Russia's highly affordable area lists more buyers.
The capital of Sofia also offers tempting offers - trade and office areas offer highest yields.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive European golf paradises, thus attracting tourists in the other two seasons, in addition to the summer and winter season.
Therefore, prospective investors are already buying in a large style, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who buy properties in Bulgaria also want to change their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested people from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers in the Black Sea and in the ski areas.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle down buy either revitalized property by 50-100,000 euros, or houses down by 5-15 000 euros, which they then renew themselves.
Good connection and accessibility as well as communication opportunities are widely written, but also the proximity to a major city, shops and doctors are crucial to the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday missile (Bulgaria was listed under the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group consists of businessmen who invest with the aim of medium to long-term value increase.
Real estate in the capital is becoming increasingly expensive, due to the ever-growing demand.
Within the EU, although the real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, in the past five years there has been a price increase of 21 per cent annually.
The value of the real estate prices is far higher than that of the tenants.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percent
As Minister of the Environment Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue by ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries advise on the Bali Roadmap, setting out the emission reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the expiry of the Kyoto Protocol.
At present, there is a strong debate between industrial and development countries.
The US has already reported that they do not want to negotiate concrete figures, but would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major issue of the conference is whether the industrialized countries are willing to support developing countries financially and technologically, in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement on support for developing countries has also been reached.
The Kyoto Protocol's adaptation fund is to be managed by a 16-headed Council, which is expected to be read in the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF) as in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary is six percent
Minister for the Environment Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to preserve its pre-accession role in global climate action and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that by 2020 the EU would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% (as measured by 1990 values), whether or not the "2012 Agreement" will be successfully achieved. The Union would even be willing to apply for a 30% reduction if other major industrial states in the world, or developing countries, were also willing to comply with their obligations by force and responsibility.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the target of the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was only 5.2%, whereas the EU, with its 15 Member States at the time, had already committed itself to a 8% reduction.
The default for Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1985-87 - a standard that will be fully met by the country as set out in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The effort is high on Bali - however, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly enter into force only after 2012. In this case, the reduction projects set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new, international emission reduction system, whose significance also has been highlighted by the IPCC, the international scientific climate change committee of the UN in its latest report, with the award of the Nobel Peace Prize.
This would delay the emission reduction, and the increase in the earth's average temperature by more than 2°C would be inevitable, resulting in extremely serious and irreparable consequences, according to scientists.
British Army on YouTube
Units of the British Army have published recordings of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for the purpose of increasing popularity on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) discovered YouTube for itself: Special Forces stationed in Afghanistan have been uploading videos about operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reports.
The footage of the helmet-mounted miniature cameras is controlled at the Kandahar Air Force Base and then sent to London, where they are put on the Internet.
Political Message Unavoidable
Air Force soldiers have already controlled 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been seen more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under "defenceheadquarters" in spring 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Commonwealth Office and the international peace troops (MNFIs) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Use in Afghanistan
The Air Force originally released the videos aimed at recruiting soldiers and, as the Ministry of Defence says, contributions are also intended to inform the public about the actual objectives of foreign institutions.
This kind of propaganda was almost free of charge compared to traditional television commercials, according to defence experts Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but these videos always contain a certain amount of political message, since they confirm the existence of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
Americans advertise with game
But the army must also fight against amateur recordings, which will also create in the net, along with carefully edited, censored recordings - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: in some hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, the loss is spoken of at the highest, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
By the way, many videos have already been uploaded to the platform from the battle scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, but these "gatting" have only recently been discovered by the British.
In fact, the Americans are advertising in some other way, with the free downloadable shooting game "American Army", in which the player can drag more or less live-stream simulation into the soldier's skin.
Christmas party with Tombola and Pogatsche in the ministries
Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth is not at all zymperistic: Instead of a Christmas celebration, she is holding a work conference where her employees will be able to make coffee and pogats go out in 2007.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, other magical Christmas mood with Tombola or attacks in the hearts of officials.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and buffet - so celebrates power.
The Christmas fever has already captured the offices.
The biggest Christmas celebration of a ministry is held today in the defence resort, but not the employees of the ministry are expected to do so.
At the "Christmas Festival of Wages", children are gifted by fallen soldiers, at which "mission celebration" family members are hosted by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resort provides around 25 million for the holidays.
Compared to other resorts, the National Agency for Development (NFC) and the Ministry of Economics and Transport are pushing the lines.
The 4.32 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is held in the House of the Future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
The focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a Tombola deliverance.
The National Agency for Development (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million-forint Christmas celebration at the House of National Justice (OIT) on Wednesday, with concerts and a party.
The room rental was 1 million forint, the rest was spent for more than 400 charged guests.
According to our information, a department of NFCs is also invited to another Christmas celebration organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU funds.
For the celebration, the building of the amusement theatre ("Vígszínház") was rented.
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information since we have not reached the competent authorities.
What's the suit for?
The ILO building was not only open to the guests of the NFU, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on 7 December.
They did not have to pay rent to the ILO for the use of the premises.
Around 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with an address from the minister, after which there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo] you were told: There was no ball-dressing or wearing obligation.
The Ministries of Health, Labour and Self-Government are preparing for a Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health organizes the festival for employees in its own four walls for about 400,000 forint.
Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas celebration, but to the conference on the anniversary.
You can count about 180 guests, who - so the press department - are only served with coffee and pogatsch, the festival goes out with 350,000 forint.
Minister Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply appear in the Ministry's Chamber.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is hosting a Christmas celebration in its own conference room, to which 436 employees are expected.
Expenditures were measured with 2,500 forint per head - for this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent shocks.
Since the beginning of the term of office of János Veres, PM employees have celebrated this way each year.
However, there will not be a proper party vote - not only because of the Minister's official speech, but also because the celebration was set for the afternoon.
On 20 January, the Ministry of Agriculture invites a new year's reception, this time the Ministry's Christmas celebration.
One asks the hundreds of guests to the castle Vajdahunyad in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the information of the resort, the expenses are measured with 1,000 forint per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple reception to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be charged.
The receptions that are held each year are traditionally starting with a short call from the minister and sounding with a lingering sigh.
As the relevant press outlets report on [origo] request, there will be no Christmas at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Education.
Asked about the cost of the Christmas celebration, no information could be provided in the Press Department of the Ministry of the Environment.
In any event, more than 400 guests were invited to the festival, which will be held in the art museum.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strike
The League of Trade Unions and the Hungarian Trade Union Federation form their coordination committee on Friday for the indefinite duration beginning on Monday.
On Saturday, a large protest meeting will be held, and on Monday - on the day of the referendum on the Health Insurance Act - work will begin.
It is calculated with strike-conditions, significant traffic barriers, as rail transport is almost completely stopped, and also the Budapest public transport companies (BKVs) are deleted up to 1 p.m.
Details of the strike on Monday are shared by the League of Trade Unions and the Trade Union Federation on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA-MOSZ strike committee is also set up, which is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
On Saturday a large protest meeting will be held, and from Monday all organizations that have joined the strike will put down the work for an indefinite time, unless agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike beginning on the day of Parliament's vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
If the National Council does not adopt the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions shall withdraw the call for strike immediately.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet to discuss further action.
Due to the National Council's agenda on Monday, it is even conceivable that it is only in the late evening hours or until midnight to vote on the Health Insurance Act.
The strike that starts on Monday will have to be taken into account with significant traffic difficulties: the railways are putting down their work for an indefinite time, the majority of public transport is in the morning and more than half of Volán companies are silent.
At the same time, there will be a lot of roadblocks in a direction.
The call for strike is followed by numerous trade unions and civil organizations - the list of participants is updated on the League website on an ongoing basis.
Some organizations announced strikes at an indefinite time, others planning a delayed downturn.
Until Thursday afternoon, there was no agreement between the Hungarian Railway MÁV and the Free Trade Union of the Railway VDSZZZZZ on sufficient performance, although around the Christmas Day more and more people are on the way.
According to previous reports, up to 1 p.m. at the BKV, at Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 p.m., the LIGA Power and Heat Power Trade Unions are putting down their work for four hours, and the Teacher Trade Union has called for 2 or 2-8 hours of strikes.
The Hungarian Association of Doctors covers the country at different times, the EDPSZ, the Democratic Trade Union of Health and Social Workers, a subsidiary of the SZEF, the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, holds a two-hour warning line.
The most important of the four points required by the League is that the government withdraws the draft reform of health insurance and submits a new concept for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
Request number three is that the eligible occupational groups are already allowed to access the early retirement scheme before 2010.
The fourth point is that the CEO of the League of Trade Unions has not accepted the offer submitted by the Ministry of Transport and is now calling for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard established in August with the support of the "Movement for a Better Hungary" have raised the risk of Hungary and the region in a number of ways.
The Institute's "risk warning report" includes: In the context of the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "intensification of existing ethnic tensions between the Roma and non- Roma population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably intended to provoke such a conflict, according to the Research Institute.
As reported, this is seen as a failure on the part of the political leaders: "People of public life have abandoned the discussion of the Roma question representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian opposition".
This is likely to exacerbate the problem, make it impossible to engage in reasonable dialogue, favour extremes, and increase the likelihood of violent conflicts.
Moreover, the research institute believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard have not been last but thanks to the enormous attention of the domestic and foreign media, "the image of Hungary has been significantly damaged abroad, especially with regard to confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember: Since autumn 2006, the reorganization of radical and extremely right groups in Hungary has been continuously under way, so since summer 2007, several organisations called "national Self-Defense Association" have been established.
"It is common for these groups to define themselves as a civil organization each, while they openly beg to prepare their members for defence tasks - including armed ones - (Catastrothean Protection, Defence, Ordinance Protection), in the face of the inactivity of the police, the army, or the state itself," it said.
And further: This is all done in accordance with that method which seeks to serve different political and party confidences of the population, based on political efforts as a civic initiative.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of the union is therefore not just about the movement of legal barriers that could occur during the registration of the court - it is also a political strategy.
As the analysis is to be taken into account, the activities of the Hungarian Guard also represent a higher risk factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months the Hungarian Guard has been cited in several neighbouring countries as a potential source of danger, so some ultra-nationalist politicians from certain neighbouring countries see in the formation of the Hungarian Guard the confirmation of its own anti-Hungarian policy.
All this has an impact on the political stability of the region" - it was called.
From the point of view of the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not an individual phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the whole region has grown.
The activities of the Hungarian Guard are reported to be comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose foundation was announced in August 2007 by the extreme right-wing Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard, the Roma mass expansions took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The UNB has also taken the occasion to establish the National Guard, with the argument that the objective of the "national protection" organisation is to be achieved.
In her opinion, in the past 17 years, a regular "cigarette terror" has been felt in Bulgaria, but the state has remained silent and indifferent - says Political Capital.
And so on: the initiative would have triggered a strong debate in the Bulgarian public.
As said, the increased risk of ethnic disputes is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced to establish their own guard for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not to be excluded that the Hungarian Roma also, with the organisation of their own protection, respond to the threats, is said in the Risk Warning Report of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital, said at the request of the News Office: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the Research Institute.
Annual risk analysis reports would be published and risk-modifying trends should be recognised, the public opinion will be informed as in the case of the issue of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere
In Hungary, holidays are regulated precisely, so that the practice of redistribution of working days has now been established around the holiday, but the next year will provide us with fewer such days.
In the EU and in America you also understand something else under "Feastday".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and working days.
Unemployed days are usually ecclesiastical holidays, or are associated with significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are unemployed days - the last only so that the Sylvesters can rest.
All year round, we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The state celebration is the 15th of March, which commemorates the revolution of 1848, and the 23rd of October, the commemoration of the revolution of 1956.
On 20 August, the founding of the state, on 1 May the work is celebrated, on 1 and 2 November we commemorate our deaths.
In addition, there are every two holidays to Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our national, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of working days shifting has proved true in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
However, the price of extended weekends is that we work very well on Saturdays before, or have to go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is finally to be completed, the Minister of Labour has for many years been laid down in his own regulation.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employees, to public employees and officials of the public service.
Only companies and establishments in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. on holidays, are exempted.
Today, the agenda is only brought together by the holiday at the end of the year: As of 24 December, life remains formal for this country, since most of the days between Christmas and Sylvester take the time off, or the holiday that is cancelled for that purpose.
The following year more holidays fall to the middle of the week, or at the end of the week, so that there will be fewer redistributions during working days than this year.
The calendar is first placed around the day of work "on the head" so that people can stay at home for four days.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day so that Friday, May 2nd can be a rest day.
The second re-disposal is linked to the holiday on 23 October: on Saturday, 18 October, you will have to finish on Friday, 24 October.
The end of the year will, however, remain unchanged in the sign of the holiday, after all lies and remains from December 24th, even if Silvester falls on a Wednesday.
Six scary little things to upset workmates
E-mails that we forget to send, language messages that we never get - harmless lies that don't happen to us anymore: they bring "color" to the workplace every day.
The question is whether you get used to these little inconveniences, or you get better at the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstandings, deliberately for other angry situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone called from the marketing department," says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
Best of all, you regret it and try to enjoy it again by perhaps calling and laughing at the marketing department, you would have forgotten to set up the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, the thing is done with an apology.
Before you go through painful arguments, you should consider how you can really prepare your colleagues for unpleasant moments and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Borrow something that doesn't belong to one?
There's hardly anything more nervous than if you get a document, office accessories, or the phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday the elevator was still on the desk - is it gone early today?
Or is the lost bullet writer discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without asking questions, you should not borrow anything from your colleagues, because they will be legally offended if they find that something has gone away.
So don't put envelopes or post-it out of the office in the bag, because it might meet one of its own: no more when you need it urgently.
The debate on the privacy of colleagues?
There is no effective means to stop a trachea that has already been put into the world.
Who did what with who?
Where and why?
The information (or suspicions) on the privacy of colleagues should not be tied to everyone’s nose as far as possible!
And if someone opens up and betrays his secret to us, we should not abuse this trust!
The best thing is to keep quiet like a grave, instead of correcting those who are not present, even if others know about the problems of the colleague.
No reason to be sick?
If you call in the office to report troublesome headaches, because you feel uncomfortable, or just want to relax, you should be aware of one thing: your own work, inexhaustible work, fixed-term projects must now be done by colleagues instead of by themselves.
So don't play bad with your colleague!
If you already know that you are not going to make it to the office the next day or that something could happen between you and you have to stay at home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Total, Geeker, Telephone
You have just been deeply involved in his work, but is suddenly disturbed by the loud enchanter of colleagues?
Don't you want to hear a phone call that you shouldn't have heard?
You shouldn't bother your colleagues with sums, songs, loud conversations (which you take over their heads), trampling, constant nagging or nagging.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not just in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Are the others always guilty?
If a project is not completed in due time, if you have forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, you should not look for the fault of your own forgetfulness with others!
If possible, you should not argue about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
The best you can do is admit your mistake, and apologize if others were affected too!
The question of how to make the mistake right again, or how to repeat the mistake, is just too much!
In the office - a feeling like home?
Training shoes and sleeping: Comfortable for home, but not lost anything in the office!
Not even then should you dress so badly if it were actually allowed to work!
Just don't get too sloppy - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself to the extent that you dress properly in the office - if desired, also nice and elegant!
Everyone wants to make it right - or how you become uninterested for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning.
From the radio comes a rare melody: The sound of a geyser, paired with electronic effects.
I'm turning the volume up.
The pace changes, the bass comes to the previous sounds, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It's the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which sounds like mr2.
For a long time, the local music scene did not defile us with a qualitative electrop.
But now you can even see the barn differently when you hear the new album by Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting production from the home digital underground scene slowly contribute to a change in the overall picture, and even if the garage rock with its guitarrengequite is "in", the home electrotrope proves: There are new things under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs, musiced himself in the band Yonderboi, before he - perhaps because a hostel does not have two peppers - began to spread his own way.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, the elements of Jazz, Electronic, and Pop were mixed, but only when he was asked to compose the soundtrack into a film (e.g.
"season" by Ferenc Török".
The formation, which started in smaller clubs, was only known to the wider audience when the magazine "wan2" selected its first album from 2002 under the top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, almost the only marketable trend set in the West.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his band "trendy", but it was not interested in whether they would like to wear this brand.
The band responded as it should: With a new, even better album.
The new album now released with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open up new ways for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécs.
The expression comes from the time when Balázs Zságer was still on his way with another band.
The airy, flying imagination would also be fine, however, alongside the essential character of the music, the louder guitars, the influences of the rock'n'roll, - corresponding to the contemporary spirit and the trends.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle" at the premiere in the Millennium.
A song from the album has even created it for the radio player - who, from the start of the newest of early to late pop music, Mr.2 Petőfi has successively put the earworm with the number "Wings of Love", which was recorded with the participation of six domestic singers ("underground Divas").
So everything's all right (?).
The Hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: How far is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "layer music" doesn't mean much to me.
In my opinion there are two boxes in pop music, not Mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be sighty and unfavourable, but it can also only be produced for sale that makes it commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motive.
The willingness of the listener to take up his audience also works according to this principle, regardless of language and country boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and the foreign audience of your music?
B. Zs.: In the overseas world, especially in the western part of us, pop music has a larger tradition.
There are not only teenagers or twos going to concerts, but also the older audience.
They pursue the trends in pop music that are happening around them, much more attentive because they also consider them part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public play in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course it's a good feeling to see more and more coming to our concerts.
But we have never composed for the market.
With us the music does not arise to serve a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the public is mostly tangible at the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but that is again only in the inaccessible changes of the moment.
Yet one thing I've noticed is that if you want to make it all right, you're not interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on his way as a soloist and has built his career in the West.
B. Zs.: We do not really go his way, even though you always try to include this in our music.
We see ourselves as a team player who trust in the musical presence of the other and let them unfold.
At first, of course, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came from his band and made another move.
hvg.hu: "Wings of Love" is first in the charts of mr2 Petőfi.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening with a slightly more popular style deliberately staged towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit that would then be performed as a train horse for the album.
In this song it's about more.
It was thought as the final of the album, with which we wanted to solve the sound orgy and the somewhat more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why did she just say what the guiding principle was?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then the idea came to put together the chorus of soloists from the local music scene.
This is how the six-headed chorus was born - that is, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikˈ Hodasi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then baptized "underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Do you want to have the song as well, or did you design it for the girls?
B. Zs.: The number was already in the instrumental version, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this number still "needs something".
The Accordion has formally requested a vote.
I used the melody the same night, and later they taught the girls.
Everything came to an end practically and intimidatingly spontaneous.
I can remember, I was pretty electric at the time, but it's already needed the Divas.
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert you had the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo party (except for Judy Jay's short solo), they have no part of their own, they sing perfectly together and are not louder than music, so their song is not only accompanied by music.
They stood on the stage too.
Is it intention?
B.G.: That they stood behind was because of purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want them to have solo roles.
In the issue, it is also because you should forget your ego a little, forget who came from and where you are going, let us just let these certain birds, the wings of love, push us.
I would have liked others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was created.
hvg.hu: What was the most expensive song?
B. Zs.: In fact, there was nothing at all in the musical work, but rather there were more difficult tasks in mixing.
For example, at "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", in which I played on a concert piano, or at "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the Groove no longer wanted to work, but gradually everything was put together, like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number from the new album?
B. Zs.: This changes with the concerts as well as now that I have released the album.
Currently it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Deceiver risked billions because of feelings of inferiority
Floorless Deceiver
Thus, his former employee Jerome Kerviel of the French banking company Société Générale, the owner of this commercial bank.
It came for almost five billion euros.
However, it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to do it to his colleagues, and he certainly wasn't incapable of it.
Unlike all large banks, he recognized the crisis in the US mortgage market in time.
"He is rather mentally weak," was to hear from his superiors, who showed him to the police.
However, as the Kerviels statements, which the French media, such as the Le Monde daily newspaper, published, show that he was a man who had achieved a profit of 1.6 billion euros by the end of last year with his business.
Crisis Not Only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he claims in his statement.
In the summer he managed to earn half a billion euros just in the US crisis.
He had already mentioned the opportunity to do so at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were first news that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as their income-deficit customers or those who had previously had payment problems, would be in difficulties.
However, this crisis should not have an impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and kept right.
At the end of the year, he had raised his profits to EUR 1.6 billion.
"Even when I had earned the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain it," Kerviel admits, saying that he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
During the entire interview, he admits that he has faked documents so that you don't come to him like that.
He even managed to lead his bosses behind the light, even though the Euroex stock exchange was gradually interested in his business.
Risk profit
Was he afraid to fly up?
Very hardly.
"I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank."
Where did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to develop his position gradually.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
After two years he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90000.
Yet he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"Even in my first conversation in 2005, I knew that I was being watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel told the investigation officials.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
With the shares of the Alliance, he earned a lot by putting half a billion euros at the London bombings at the price of this title.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll let you.
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses apparently knew everything, or they knew it.
"As long as I make money, you close your eyes."
But then at the beginning of this year came the great blow.
On one day he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to make up for it.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros.
And how did they get to him?
Suspectedly, he took a vacation.
"I only took four days from the year before.
A broker who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want to be seen in the cards," Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has the chance to come to 365 billion
The Czech Minister and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, which could bring the Czech Republic to EUR 14 billion in the coming years (about SEK 365 billion).
This is about half of the amount that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Approximately 125 billion kroner comes from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive approximately 100 billion kroner from the "Company and Innovation" programme.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will flow into transport.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22% of the funds Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money increases according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have 90.8 billion next year.
The "Company and Innovation" programme is intended to help entrepreneurs and companies to make money for innovative businesses.
This means that companies will earn funds for the introduction of new technologies, for enterprise research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organisational methods.
Czech Republic is among the least successful among the new accession countries to date.
Nicaraguan Court of Justice confirmed twenty years' imprisonment for Presidents
On Thursday, an appeal court in Nicaragua confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud amounting to $100 million (nearly SEK 1.8 billion).
But later he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his Hazinda at the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state is coming back behind bars is currently unclear, according to the AP News Agency.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the prison officials whether to let Alemán stay at home or whether he must be in prison.
Four years ago, a court pointed out that Germany had regularly moved the government's money to foreign companies' accounts in Panama.
These companies were fictional and the accounts actually belonged to their relatives and their closest followers.
Some of this money eventually landed in a fund set up by the German to finance its 2001 election campaign.
Budget is by
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget proposed by this government and adopted by the majority without support from the opposition.
The ČSSD (Social Democrats) has been approved for the current year because Minister Sobotka (of this party) had submitted it, and the ČSSD could therefore not afford to refuse it.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion for a resolution against the Government, nothing has happened dramatic this time.
The House of Representatives acknowledged this traditionally little respect, yet the most important law in all peace.
That's kind of a paradox.
All governments begin and end with the individual chapters and entries of the budget, whether or not one likes it.
The budget is an essential part of the policy, but it is covered by the power struggle of the government and the opposition.
This is a more appreciative topic for the media, and therefore they pay more attention to it.
A conflict among politicians is much more interesting to the public than nude numbers.
The state budgets left three weaknesses in the past social democratic governments, which cannot eliminate the budget for 2008 at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure that is mandatory by law, which is not only about pensions, but also about social expenditure that the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (Communists) decided in the past year before the elections.
The second is the deficitary budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third limitation is in the deficits of public finances, i.e. the deficits of the Communities.
However, the biggest risk is not the state budget deficit.
This budget is publicly and in some ways under control.
A real time bomb, however, is the municipality's budget deficit.
Many mayors have spent money on other sources of investment, with the exception of income from taxes, taxes and bank credits, often incurring excessive debt claims on their councils.
In recent years they have managed to pay off these debts by mass sale of shares of energy and other supply networks that they had received during the privatisation of the state.
Now this source is already sealed.
To the extent that we only hold to official and verifiable facts, we note that:
Our economy has been going on for several years, like the rest of the world, a phase of growth that the ČSSD has been celebrating without delay.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to manage public finances.
Instead, these governments owed the State even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more rationally than our republic.
This is a huge scandal to be attributed primarily to the former governments.
We are among the countries that are at least threatened by poverty, as seen in the global scale.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes, which have, unfortunately, been superfluous in recent years.
Even if it has succeeded in eliminating some of the senseless populist expenditures passed this year before the elections, it is clear that if in the near future there is no shift in the pension age and pension reform, then practically all policies in this country will end, and, just as the person in power will not remain a pure administrator.
It is only slightly exaggerated when it is said that then, from ruling politicians, they will become officials who share most of the tax revenue mechanically on pensions and social expenditure.
That is why this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but it can only be a means of ensuring compliance with normal expenditures.
The deficit of SEK 70 billion planned for 2008 would be quite excessive if previous governments had not spent the last ten years just gone by.
If we do not really want it to come to the fact that ruling politicians become pure administrative officials, then we need to be patient and not all that powerful coalition government, which is aware of the fact that the state can only spend as much as it is able to accept taxes and fees, want to rest in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these allow for the gradual implementation of a balanced state budget.

Banks Want to Cope With Crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Central Banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis on financial markets.
In this way, more than $100 billion will be made available through auctions to the currency markets.
In these auctions, banks auction interest rates to which they are willing to lend each other money.
For example, the US Fed sends $40 billion to auction, another 24 for the European and Swiss Central Bank.
It is the first time, following the attacks of 11 September, that the central banks of each country agree to such a coordinated defence procedure or to reflect the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is intended to address the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the growing lack of free available capital that banks can provide," wrote Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group in a report for his customers.
"The coordinated action of the central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the US from 65% to about 50%," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unsecured loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions of losses.
"The central banks must have been really afraid of what could happen when they decided to do this," said ABN Amro's chief economist Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
The central banks are afraid that if the banks themselves have difficult access to loans, credit will also become more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and bring the US economy to a recession, possibly with an impact on economic growth worldwide.
The central banks have decided to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate of London's interbank interest used in the lending of money between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to lend each other money, although the central banks of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom had reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as another decrease in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of the agency Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this step of central banks contributes to the warming of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the US real estate market.
Klaus: Debates of the Ecologists Are Unbelievable
Global climate change is supposed to damage most developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again spoke on the issue of global warming.
Criticism now refers to the UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue, No Green Planet", he argued that the debates of ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which is a rare mixture of government representatives and such non-governmental organisations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric they accompany and the reality.
"The debate is unstructured there, it is a verbatim work that is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed in his presentation of his book that his subject was very important to him and that he was so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared in German translation because "I often encounter cartoons of my views."
So now interested people could read their attitude unmistakably.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climate scientist, but he felt that he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
Finally, he is an academic, capable of understanding and evaluating professional negotiations, has experience with statistics and is also a national economist.
As the main point of the book, he described the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consistent opinion among scientists about global warming that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and therefore no threat, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate are excessive, effective and unacceptable.
In addition, he considers it as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems to be unacceptable to impose other unproven views, he considers this as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He repeatedly stated that he was not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who do not take account of the relationship between effort and income."
Klaus had spoken on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600,000 people couldn't exchange their driver's license
600,000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driver's license, whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day where you can apply for the exchange so that the authorities can make it possible to issue a new driving licence by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers will take their way to the streets after the New Year without a valid driving licence.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive have not changed their licence.
While small places report a strong decline in interest in the exchange of driver's licenses, the offices of the capital are overrun with applications, and interest in exchange is still growing this week.
The city administration prepares about 2000 customers daily.
It's about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driver's license.
The exhibition will take 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shorter period of five days.
In this case, the driver must pay 500 kroner.
Drivers who do not create the required exchange until the end of the year and run without a valid driver's license are threatened with a financial penalty from January.
The perpetrator pays up to 2,000 kroner.
But the police can also use it with a reminder when they commit an offence.
In the event of an infringement, the penalty may increase to 2500 kroner.
According to previous information, the person may also be punished by the municipality who is not driving at all.
He could, so it was called, threaten a penalty of even 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has already called on the officials to force Milde and to impose a fine of up to 1,000 kroner.
According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one threatened a thousand crowns penalty.
The driver's license is a document in which everyone can decide whether or not to own it.
It's not about a personal ID that everyone, even a valid one, has to have.
People who don't want to drive anymore should give up their driver's license.
It is enough to bring him to the competent community or to send him there by mail.
At the end of the year, licences issued between 1964 and 1993 are invalid.
However, drivers have to gradually exchange other types of driver's licenses.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 still have three years for the exchange.
The validity of licences issued in 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanselka, there are about 2.6 million additional driving licences.
Court reduces penalties for detectives who were connected with Berdych
The former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Konňarík, who are accused of having made a joint case with the band by David Berdych, received 13 or 10 years of imprisonment.
In a judicial judgment, the Prague Supreme Court decided to reduce its sentence by one or two years.
Originally, the detectives of the "Office for Combating Organized Crime" threatened 14 or 12 years respectively.
Against today's judgment there is no appeal, only revision of the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is accused in this case, but first of all he has the first judgment.
In other processes, however, he had already been punished for a total of 16 years.
He can't be convicted anymore.
In January 19th, a district court accused individuals of involvement in robbery incidents, which today the Supreme Court negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the accused argued from the outset with the argument that it was a built case.
According to the Central Bohemian District Court, members of the police in consultation with Berdych Offenders provided information from police sources, covered various robbery incidents and helped members of the gang to refrain from prosecution.
The band left Opava and Konjárík 30 percent of the bet for it.
The charge concerns crimes committed by the gang from 1999 to 2001.
Especially in cases of robbery, whose victims often suffer serious injuries, but also in cases of official intervention and illegal possession of weapons.
In the case of domestic investigations, the police discovered illegal guns, ammunition with steel cores, a laser remote tube and a machine gun.
The gang has, according to its robbery, enriched itself by millions of crowns.
Except for almost 20 men in this procedure, Berdych and a number of others were found legally guilty of further robbery.
Other men from Berdychs County must be responsible in another process, other cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The main negotiations have so far been held by Tomáš Póta and Maroš Šuljej, who are in Irish custody and are awaiting the final decision on their release for prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children exchange - bill: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a decommissioning clinic, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, from the hospital in Trěbíč will require 12 million kroner compensation plus court costs.
For each of the mothers every three million, for the fathers every two million and for the children every one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent couple.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, is therefore not in agreement with the Velebas proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it is too many," Dostál said after today's debate.
"But to be able to give us an opinion on this counter proposal, we need the opinion that made the opposite.
We will find out if it is worth any statement.
But we believe that this should be the case for all in the hundreds of thousands," Dostál stressed.
The amount should be between NOK 100000 and NOK 200000 for each of the four parents.
At first, the Jabloňov family wanted a million crowns for every month she had not raised her biological daughter.
For Veleba, an opinion prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol served as the basis for compensation negotiations.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, the parents of the children suffer psychological damage and stress symptoms in different strengths and depths.
The men were better able to cope with the stress situation, even if they saw objections to it, they could have prevented the confusion of the newborns.
Again, the women get worse off with the effects of the trauma experienced, as well as with what is happening right now, Veleba stuck to the content.
Veronica and Nikola moved to Třébíč, a hospital nurse last December.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Chermáks in Pribyslavice, and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, the district chief of Vysočina (Böhmisch-Mämarische height) handed over 100000 kroner to each family as a replacement for expenses incurred by them by the failure of the hospital in Třébíč, which is under the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are covered by laws on liability.
In the event of doubt, they must access a reserve fund, only exceptionally they can apply for assistance from the carrier.
The Courts have so far taken into account relatively low amounts of damages, which have been determined by tables and are moving in the area of hundreds of thousands, with the exception of millions.
Polivka came around his kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the fight about the brand "Kingy Walachei".
According to the judge at the District Court in Ostrava, he was the first to use the name "Walachic King", but the project had built a team around Tomáš Harabiš in collaboration with the actor in long-term work.
Polivka did not participate in the negotiations today.
According to his lawyer, this is probably not the end of the matter, and his mandate will probably be called on.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to share in the popularity of Bolek Polívkas parasitics," the lawyer said after the negotiation.
All presented themselves with the words "Walachisches Kingdom" just this actor and comedian.
The same opinion is also Harabish.
"We have almost ten years' work behind us.
Buying money and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the cause of the dispute is money.
"After years they found that the project was successful and that they could also have some of it.
They want to get parasitic at our work," he continued.
Liquefied business
According to the court, Polívka used the name "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television broadcasts.
In 1993, he was crowned by the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
However, this did not go along with the intention of establishing a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came to the thought of distributing Welsh passports.
From an original fun action, a business and an entrepreneurial activity was crystallised and joined by Harabiš to the establishment of the company "Walachisches Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use his name and signature in the passports and even offered her owners discounts when visiting his farm and his theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabiš used only the mere idea that Polívka had made public in the message "Manege" for his business purposes.
"The popularity of Polívkas has certainly helped the project of the Walloon Kingdom," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was Harabiš and his team who had made an intense dedication to him.
The cooperation of the parties today to date lasted until 2000, when Harabiš for Polívka in Vsetín organised the official crown.
Since then, however, there have been disputes between Polívka and Harabiš, which culminated in the section "King Boleslavs I. selected until the St. Nimmerleins Day".
The leadership then took on the initiative of Harabiš Jarmila Šulaková as the queen's mother.
In 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clearness in the dispute could bring the battle prepared by Harabiš around the throne and half a princess.
This is what a new king should come up with.
He didn't want to betray details and an appointment.
"We don't want to agree.
It should be something like the King's suit in the Walachei.
The king should be elected for a certain time.
Mr. Polívka can also log in quietly," Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Benefits of sneezing
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving properties were not very valuable, the quality of walking, driving and also processing could be described as rather on average.
But now he is his successor, the Peugeot 207, on the market, and he is much better.
The combo with the name SW is still a piece, and I'm just left to revise my opinion.
When I had tested the classic Hatchback of 207, for example, I had to complain about the too little freedom of mind on the backseat.
These complaints are no longer available, because the body of the van is designed so that no two-meter men will suffer.
Continue
I'm just going through the interior just so I don't repeat myself too much.
This is a very successful design, where I have objections only because of the worrying middle tunnel.
There I would welcome something more designer design where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and the times are over where we may complain about too short seats or head restraints.
The content of the page has also improved significantly compared to the 206.
As for the offer of space, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the body.
In the combo, the already mentioned lack of freedom is also eliminated.
The case in the trunk
But the main thing about this car is the shop.
I have to call it (also due to the folding back window) as very loadable and space-saving.
The cave rooms are equipped with restraints that represent an ideal compromise.
They don't bother, they let each other apart, and they also keep heavy objects.
But we're talking about the volume of charge.
According to the table in the basic equipment, it is 428 litres, which is a rather average value compared to competition.
However, compared to the most sold vehicle in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
When we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we note that the Peugeot remains at a significantly sensitive 52 litre.
This value is already critical for a holiday abroad or when you invite a baby carriage.
But in order to highlight the positive, I still have to mention the completely flat loading room or the very low loading edge after the flip of the seat.
120 PS in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-wheel gasoline engine with a hebraum of 1.6 litres and a power of 88 kWp.
And, frankly, it's supposed to look like a 1600-Kubik engine that drives a family hatchback.
He's quiet, he's got a little consumption and he's getting away with it.
If I compare him to his opponent at Škoda, which sometimes seems to be his exuberance with a stick, then I can only be thrilled by him.
The price list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not exactly traditional.
But we must remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine amounting to 329900 kroner still applies.
With our engine it costs from 410900 kroner, which is quite a lot already.
The premium equipment of the test cart once again beats to book with 80000 kroner.
However, we had copperbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic disc wiper trigger, electrical window wipers behind and...
The car costs a total of SEK 531900.
This is a lot, but once you calculate the extra equipment of a fabia and you will arrive at a very similar sum.
So there's only one choice left which brand you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak students into British schools is not possible
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries increases, resulting in local anxiety over the further development of local school life.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far been hampered by a number of obstacles.
British schools even identify cases where disputes between immigrants and children of the original inhabitants increase in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools is illustrated by the case of North Kent, where the conflicts between local and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Struggles, scissors and bullies among students have transferred to the relationship between parents.
The situation has developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had beaten a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused claimed that the boy had abused them with racist insults.
After an attack by two minor girls, the police also had to intervene on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls had allegedly made racist remarks against the man and threw him with stones.
"When we went home, a boy climbed onto a bus house and jumped on us.
When I told him that he was going to stop, he threw us with apples and beers and then opened up his seat," described a mother of Slovak students in The Times another unpleasant event.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals called the struggle with immigrants from Eastern Europe even as a struggle for survival.
The above cases show that the mood between locals and immigrants in British schools is becoming more and more tense.
In the UK, 70000 Slovaks were registered who came here for work.
Some 30,000 Slovak students then attend British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday will be fulfilled if you choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with cellars offering on the beach pizza, ice cream and disturbing cocktails.
Kitesurfing, Golf and Roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find it to an extreme extent.
But only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
By the time of the Spaniards Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place a human eye has ever seen.
Havana once became a camp or transit camp of treasures that the Spaniards had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
And then the American era came.
The Hotel Nacional was founded at the end of the 20th century.
It was built by one of the leaders of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (especially during the ban) was seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high houses grew, over the wide boulevards driving cars that were among the cult symbols of the fiftieth century last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havanas, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
On the walls of Bodeguita del Medio, stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar at the Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails according to your wish.
And the cult cars of the fifty go around Havana to this day, because the once imported Schigulis and Fiats in the salty and wet air have been falling apart for a long time.
May Havana, especially his oldest part, have come down hard, nowhere in the area is there as many wonderful colonial sights as just here.
Other places are released directly, for example Trinidad.
In view of the urgent need for the money of tourism, there was green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, not only have new hotels been created in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of Holguín Province and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba also offers a marathon that is unique in the world and attracts, in particular, railway lovers.
The sugar tube from remote plants brought steam and self-propelled narrow-track railways to the sugar factories.
Their driving fleet has not been renewed for decades, and this is how you can see powerful and fully functioning locomotives, whose old friends are in the museum for a long time.
Exploration objectives
The most important places do not allow the majority of visitors to Cuba.
So you don't have to write about Varadero or Havana in detail anymore.
Just keep in mind that in Hemingways already mentioned, there is a museum whose visit should not be avoided by those who like this writer.
The Vináles valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The ubiquitous vegetation grows on limestone.
The mogotas, limestone hills and rocks rise steeply from the valley floor, in their cave rooms collected fertile soils, which are also covered by wet rock areas of dense vegetation.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form you can meet him when you visit one of Havana's cigarette factories.
Perhaps it is also interesting that the Chilean consequences of the "Major Zeman" TV series were turned there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spaniards colonized the island.
Her fame and wealth brought her the trade with slaves and sugar.
The richness was incorporated into the beautiful beauty of the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed since four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountain, is such a remote place that there was no road that the area would have been connected to the rest of the country in the fiftieth century.
This isolation contributed to the lack of attention.
Nothing was built there, but that's why nothing was torn off, everyone was happy that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, it is worth looking at interesting places in the area, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the "Tall of Sugar Factory".
In the evening you should go to Casa de la Música, which lives after the darkness, and where the music does not fade until the morning.
Baracoa
These cities all over the east of Cuba are called some as the most beautiful island.
Surely this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both streets leading by Guantanamo must overcome high and steep mountains and run through a landscape that is hardly affected by human intervention.
These eastern suburbs of Cuba included UNESCO thanks to its unaffected nature in its World Heritage List.
The best chocolate is produced there, in which you show the cross of Columbus (in fact it is about a hundred years after the rides of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the present El Castillo Hotel, stands, are several table mountains, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountain, the boar and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana Cabaret, the sanctuary of Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves are recognized, many pages could be written about.
But, as you say, it's better to look with your own eyes.
Allied in Afghanistan are passive, alleged Americans.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment affect the United States according to the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Minister of Defence Robert Gates, NATO should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan does not follow its ideas, and the representatives of the countries who have stationed units in the south of the country in Edinburgh agreed on this.
In addition to the growing resistance on the Taliban side, the eight participating states are also discussing further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its Minister of Defence Robert Gates, calls on NATO units to become more active, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the Afghan Government's authority and in intensifying development aid.
"In Afghanistan a forward development is tangible, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable the inhabitants to begin a further development of the economy and security themselves," says British Defence Minister Des Browne of the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels has reached the highest level, according to the U.S. Army, for five years.
The number of acts of violence has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, in the southern province of Helmand even by 60 percent.
NATO countries have stationed around 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have come to an absolute limit as regards the organisation and equipment of the units.
In particular, they call for additional helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the next time and how we can achieve them," Gates said.
Similarly, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop spoke today.
"I am not pleased with what we have available in Afghanistan to countries and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's too little," said De Hoop of the Reuters Agency for the conclusion of three days' talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive
Among the participating countries, there has also been a dispute in recent months as to whether all allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
For example, due to liabilities, Germany was criticised.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
The British Boulevard newspaper "Sun" described this week as the German soldiers as falsifiers.
"Afghan non-stewards: The Germans are making games while our boys are fighting," the Sun wrote in a contribution that was supplemented by pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German image newspaper went against the attack and printed a picture of a British unit in a Rugby competition in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will rise to one billion in 2009
Each Czech country has a public debt of 84,000 kroner.
The total debt rose to SEK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion wives this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to better development of state budgetary policies.
The State debt of the Czech Republic rose to SEK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
Within the first nine months of this year, they have increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its statements on the State debt from the beginning of October.
Each Czech country owes 84,000 kroner.
Over the past year, the state owed more than 111 billion kroner.
"So far it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we will be overrun by a billion crowns perhaps only in 2009.
Next year, the debts should move between 900 billion and a billion kroner," said David Marek, an analyst at Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladimir Pikora, an analyst at the Next Finance, says: "We could get over a billion in the course of 2009.
If that is the case, it depends on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If the situation on the political stage changes and politicians should be willing to save more, this could take until 2010.
But I'm not going out of such a change," he noticed.
Debts grow
The State debt is attributable to the debt of the State government and is mainly due to the accumulation of government deficits.
The State debt is financed by the European Investment Bank's valuation instructions, government debt statements, direct loans or, for example, by the European Investment Bank.
In the meantime, domestic government debt rose to SEK 719.4 billion this year.
The state's foreign debt has now increased by SEK 1.7 billion to SEK 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable state debt reached SEK 803.3 billion at the end of September and fell by SEK 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of public debt rose to 6.5 years.
"The total debt rose by 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really much in view of how good the economy is.
It is interesting that growth should be recorded primarily in debt securities, where growth is 20 percent.
It is bad that the debts are rising, but on the other hand this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes," said Pikora, commenting on the data.
Better Than Expected
From the financing strategy and the management of public debt for 2007, it is clear that the government had planned to raise SEK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to SEK 152.8 billion due to better development of state budgetary policies.
This amount is mainly due to the state budget deficit, which will obviously reach SEK 76 billion this year instead of the estimated SEK 91.3 billion.
Furthermore, this is the maximum planned funding for the consolidation agency of SEK 13.3 billion, a ten-billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of government debt claims for EUR 43 billion, and interest rates for loans to the European Investment Bank of EUR 1.8 billion.
For giving a name to a Teddy bear, she was brought before a court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher charged in Sudan with insulting Islam was sentenced on Thursday evening by a court in Khartoum to 15 days' imprisonment and subsequent expulsion.
The British was accused of allowing six-to-seven-year-old students to give a Teddy bear the name Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
She would have deserved to be eaten.
After parents of students had repeatedly complained at the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old elementary school teacher who worked at the Unity High School of Khartoum was arrested at home on Sunday and, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, was accused of insulting Islam.
In fact, this matter takes its place in early September when the teacher invites her six-to-seven-year-old students to choose a name for the classeddy.
The children propose eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed , reports schoolmaster Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as their favorite first name.
Certainly, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all also a very common first name in Sudan.
Then the children have created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the image caption My name is Mohammed.
The bear itself did not bear a sign with that name, but the problem is quite simple that the representation of the Islamic prophet is seen as an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, explained that he knew her well, and she would never have done anything to bring her religious belief too close, I regret only that she had asked the children to vote for a name, in his opinion it was just an innocent error.
An opinion shared by many students of the teacher, who describe it as very attentive to their students and as a person who never speaks in class about religion.
It is recalled that the first name Mohammed at the same time is the second most common name in Britain, for which there are 14 different writing methods in English.
This often chosen name by Muslim families is considered as a kind of honor to the prophets (it is often given to the first-born of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
For example, can you give it to a toy?
This, of course, is a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, there was no agreement at the last negotiating session in Vienna on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended a sixth and last discussion session on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their controversy over the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not reach agreement on the status, European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger explained at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that the peace in the region was at stake, his American counterpart, Frank Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina, called on to fulfil their commitments to achieve peace, and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No violence is expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added and indicated that there are quite clear tensions.
End of the communication on 10 December
Troika mediators, which unite the European Union, the US and Russia, will meet in Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province inhabited by Albanian speakers could be clarified if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Kharchenko submitted their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiating session since the Troika had received the mandate of the UN for a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their mediation to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked Kosovo's independence from the Security Council, continue negotiations beyond that deadline.
Russia was and remains the advocate of a negotiated solution, an acceptable solution, Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Single Declaration of Independence?
After Kosovo has been under UN administration for eight years, the Western countries maintain independence under EU supervision for the only solution in the future.
Pristina is prepared to announce this unilaterally if the Security Council should not decide on their behalf.
Belgrade is based on greater autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, the President of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced in the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations of the last chance have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo Rebellion and future prime minister of the province, shared his sorrows.
However , he added that the plan proposed by Belgrade belongs to the autonomy of a past that has led to murders and deportations .
Dominic Effects
Serbian President Boris Tradic was of the opinion that a compromise should always be sought, and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence from the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly a "domino effect" in a region that is still so weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
For Serbia this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision should be taken solely and alone in the Security Council, where their Russian ally held a veto right.
Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word
Only a decision from the Security Council series is acceptable to Serbia, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council.
Fatmir Sejdiu replied that the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status and added that any unilateral declaration of independence from the Albanian-speaking people in agreement with the Western countries will run.
Bush unlocks an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, held on Tuesday under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed to a joint declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a peace agreement by the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians have to destroy the terrorist infrastructure and Israel has to stop its colonization work, Bush said, while he reminded the two parties of their commitments to the peace plan they had agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority at the end of Abbas should seek a peace treaty, which should clarify all open questions without exception, including the central issues.
This term includes the three serious problems facing the Israeli-Palestinian disputes mainly: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees who were dispersed from their homeland during the 1948 conflict in the present state of Israel.
Following the American President, Abbas took the floor and insisted that the upcoming negotiations be conducted comprehensively and thoroughly and provide for all points, including Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water and security.
When Olmert took the floor, he undertook that the forthcoming ceasefire negotiations would be conducted directly and without interruption and that he would strive to bring them to an end by the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of its vision of two states, a Palestinian and an Israeli side by side, for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has received insurance from Bush in this sense from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, led a plan taken by all Arab countries to offer peace to Israel, in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a milestone in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, the Saudi-Arab prince means in his interview with the Arabic-language daily newspaper funded by Saudi funds.
In the opinion of the public prosecutors, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this kind of local news, official versions and rumors are facing each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigations by the National Police Discipline Authority (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 5:00 p.m., a police car drove on the Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no use, but was on strips, and he drove 40-50 km/h, without bluelight, explains a police spokesperson.
A green bike of the Kawasaki brand, without permission, not released for public road transport (see below), came, controlled by two young people without helmet, with very high speed.
It hit the left-hand side of the police car after it had misjudged its progress from the right, a policeman continued.
Alcohol control carried out on vehicle passengers is very negative.
The condition of the car (spoiled catflies, fragmented windshield, broken impact stop) is evidence of the stiffness of the impact.
Very quickly, already yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an insight into the "facts of the involuntary murder of persons and the lack of assistance to persons in danger", in agreement with the Chief Directorate for Public Security of Val-d`Oise.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor stated that she excluded the responsibility of police officers from investigating the IGPN at this stage.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, who were heard on Sunday evening, confirmed the version of the policemen, namely that this small power wheel had reached their left side relatively quickly.
Yesterday, a kind of rally showed, certainly caused by the cracking of the footpaths on the ground, that the two vehicles were stuck together until the police managed to brake it.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical inspection.
The bodies of the two victims were obdurate yesterday.
What happened next?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor made the round about which the police would have left the accident very quickly, without the help of the two young people.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also exclude any serious errors.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigations that are needed for further investigations and which must be done very carefully.
Libération has met an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, to try to revive her, this Witness tells us.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely broken cop who went off.
Two others tried to relive one of the young people who called.
In view of the tension that had occurred quickly and, it seems, because of the certainty that the people present had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the policemen were taken into the car by colleagues who had been hit by the accident.
Still, according to this testimony, the rescue forces met about twenty minutes after the police left.
They also used heart massages, but mistakenly.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police officers would not have helped the young people.
You've done this young man's first help.
The firearm has come immediately.
Everything was done to try to save her, the prosecutor stressed.
In Pakistan, tension is rising
On Monday, the Pakistani police defeated the first demonstrations, two days earlier by General Musharraf of Emergency.
According to evidence, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who protested against the emergency measures were injured by the tear gas grenades employed there by the law enforcement.
They then threw stones with which they injured the police.
At least 350 lawyers were provisionally arrested.
Similar scenarios were found in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police lawyers attacked and injured.
Several would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, lawyers of the Supreme Court's judiciary have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests by oppositional, human rights prosecutors and lawyers during the weekend.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were blocked to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations had taken place in Multan (Mitte) and Peshawar (Northeastern).
On Monday, the prosecution received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal Alliance, whose president urged the people to send flowers to the judges who had spoken against the emergency and to those who had made an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promises are no longer valid
The Supreme Court of Justice of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday evening.
In the following days, he had to refer to the legitimacy of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct election on 6 October.
The President of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was exonerated and dismissed.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the Magistrate of The News explained.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to give the command over the army and become a civilian president is no longer valid since the emergency call, Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to deliver his military uniform by 15 November, the date on which his first term of office ended as president.
The Deputy Minister of Information has also confirmed that the elections could be postponed from January.
In addition, the Pakistani government dismissed the rumors that President Musharraf would have been assigned a place of residence by his deputy military leader.
Still more than one third of pregnancy is not planned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuvirth Act, which allowed the prevention of reception in France, one of three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the different methods of prevention of reception such as the pill or the spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which found that the percentage of pill users between 20 and 40 years of age using the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalisation of reception prevention has nevertheless allowed better control of fertility.
However, eight out of ten births today were carefully planned.
At one of five couples even calculated exactly on the month, and, if possible, in the spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his friends from the International Space Station (ISS) will have spent more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector that is indispensable for the continuation of scientific work at the station.
A bold exit, due to its duration, the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools used by the astronauts to perform the repair, has achieved several records.
The problem occurred on Wednesday, when the astronauts had left the module Harmony from Space Discovery, a large cylindrical part to be taken up by European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratories.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was, therefore, to implement a 17.5 tonnes heavy-duty module for power generation over solar collectors already on the ISS to bring it into its final position.
After it had been transferred, the crew made up the restructuring of the solar collectors of the module, whose span is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors who appeared like accordiones was damaged by a taped cable at a length of about one metre
The restructuring was stopped in order not to damage the collector anymore.
Astronauts who originally left the spacecraft Discovery for a check trip and then had to repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around at the end of the 30-metre remote-controlled arm of the space ferry at which the station was stationed to perform the repair.
He is one of the best spacewalkers in NASA.
Large, resistant, very sent, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
So the 46-year-old learned doctor was chosen to operate the injured solar collector.
After carefully observing the damage, he split the faulty cable and fixed a sort of rail in the damaged place.
He was supported by a second spacewalker who remained close to the castle, and, from within, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, the commander of the crew.
The tool that he used, a mini-hockey battler, developed with an insulator to create several hundred volts of solar collectors to prevent an electric blow, the astronauts on board the station had thought and assembled.
When the action was finished, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully unfolded before he counted his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before seven astronauts returned to space exploration today, likely to return to Earth on Wednesday.
The title of EADS on the stock exchange is sanctioned
After the aviation and defence group announced that it would have to spend between EUR 1.2 billion and 1.4 billion to counter the A400M balances, the EADS share is currently showing a significant decline in the Paris Stock Exchange.
Currently, EADS loses 4% to 21.96 Euro at the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its business forecasts for 2007 once again with regard to the residues caused by the A400M engine which slow down the flight of the aircraft.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of their military aircraft amounted to between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion, of which more than one billion for airbus, were announced by the parent companies of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operational performance targets (EBITs) for 2007, when presenting its quarterly results, without further details.
The group also states that the estimate of the new costs is related to the six-month residual.
In order to remind us that the operating performance of EADS fell by 86% in 2006, due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, the very large carrier aircraft A380.
Originally, the group had planned the first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The selection of the status quo
On Sunday it will not be exciting to count the urns: the mass of the Russians will decide for President Putin's party, the United Russia.
After a very successful election campaign, she confirms her desire for stability, yes even for authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a message broadcast to the voters, who had already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He does this in his capacity as the top candidate of the United Russia, the pro-Kreml party for which an overwhelming victory is announced.
Yesterday, the President did not allow anything to be seen when he received the foreign ambassadors, and he was pleased to provide a new attack on the Western powers accused of interference - his favorite theme during the election campaign.
We know the price of a true democracy and hope for fair elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have changed.
She's blackmailing an underpressed election campaign.
The Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there would never have been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the repression of the demonstrations last weekend, former chess world champion Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days in detention for unauthorized demonstrations, according to his lawyer, he continued to be prohibited from visiting.
The Russians have maintained the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections without tension, two very important questions are raised:
Who will succeed Putin as President?
The Official Journal announced yesterday the date of the first election of the presidential elections on 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December time to make themselves known.
Since he was elected in 2000 and was re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot succeed for a third term of office.
And now there's no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Will the President of the majority of Parliament and the All-Powered Party of the United Russia, the Government and the President be elected?
Whatever it may be, in the parliamentary elections or in the presidential elections, the previous power will triumph.
That's tradition.
The Russians have maintained the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus, they are not the Lord of their destiny, according to sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent centre of Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg even goes back: The bourgeois society has only developed very slowly in this country, which has been Christianized for five centuries to Europe; the famous Community spirit has slowed down the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin relinked to the model of a paternistic state, which was fully adopted by the population, the more, since this new paternism was not followed by terror, but by some economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians from free pieces renounce the personal responsibility that they have brought to light shortly after the fall of the USSR.
How much longer do you think?
This phenomenon concerns all social stories, including the business world.
And the board of directors understands the status quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional presidents) are running the local electoral lists of the United States of Russia.
The new freedoms that come from the West are often as important to chaos as they were in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion by Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: How long do you think?
Those who are in authority are not so bad as to ransom themselves.
A Hard Mind
After having been treated confidentially for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely available.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are located 27 km long in Bad Arolsen, could not be seen until now, unless with a humanitarian purpose, i.e. individual and name-related, i.e. at the request of a former victim or his family.
In May 2006, the eleven states, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed to make them available to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process has been completed, the opening is valid since yesterday.
Hectic Information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will enable us to carry out research, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the detention camps and the state of health of forced labourers, says Reto Mastern, the head of this archive, managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, have also been opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public because of the high level of information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The arrest lists of the concentration camps or the arrest orders issued by the Gestapo were collected for a practical reason after the war: to find civilians deported or subjected to forced labour, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Today, more than 300 staff are working on tens of thousands of personal requests in Bad Arolsen.
However, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in accessing the pool of Arolsen.
You cannot expect anything fundamental new in these documents, said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, Head of the Research Centre for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, 2006.
The EU and India want a free trade agreement in 2008.
Today, trade between India and Europe is already at 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's main trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, indicated that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU foreign ministers had given the European Commission a green light last April to open negotiations to sign free trade agreements (ALEs) with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Aseans).
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the EU's ninth trading partner.
A free trade pact will bring the two economic spaces forward enormously and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans, confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products from India, the European Commissioner further stated. The Asian and European giants are exchanging goods worth EUR 47 billion each year and services worth EUR 10 billion, this week said Danjele Smadja, President of the European Commission's subscription in New Delhi, and regrets that the mutual trade has not yet exhausted its potential. On Friday, the EU and India meet at their eighth diplomatic meeting in New Delhi, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of the concern and offers 10 billion pounds for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England expressed concern about reducing the current recurring concern over the credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with unusual duration.
In order to mitigate the fears that the conditions on the financial market will be particularly severe at the end of the year and to provide banks with greater certainty of how to organise their liquidity positions at that time, the Bank intends to provide a significant part of its savings during the maintenance phase beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks.
The Bank further states that on 6 December, at 12.15 GMT 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put into circulation, at the base tax rate and only until 10 January.
This appears to be the first time that the BoE is operating liquidity in an open market operation for five weeks.
This usually happens for a week.
The BoE adds in its Communication that it is prepared to take further measures to obtain the interest rates of the interbank loans from day to day with their basic interest rate.
The rate of interbank interest between day and day was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The rate of three months has fallen to 6.6%, slightly higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the sums carried over by the Bank of England have been combined with penalties which the banks have refrained from using.
According to certain rumors, reinforced by the development of the pound rate in contrast to the euro, many were willing to sign up for the amounts carried over by the European Central Bank to more favourable interest rates and with a more secure discretion
UMP and NC refuse to check the PS proposals for purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
The text produced in the context of a socialist niche (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary grouping) presented about ten measures adopted by the National Committee of the PS on Wednesday, of which 50% were for the addition of employment, the re-introduction of the TIP, a transport check or the restriction of rentals.
After UMP and NC had voted against the review of the article (180 votes to 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which offered some strong words between majority and opposition occasion, several hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's television contribution to the purchase power.
The Chairman of the Members of the PS Jean Marc Airault announced that his group would present the whole of its proposals as an amendment to the bill for the correction of the finances that had been examined last week by the Assembly.
A new festival is born
As a result of numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 presentes, the promoter/producer announces the Wineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the Festival Republic of the British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, no longer and less, has served as an example for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones from C3 shared on Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Wineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will probably take place from 8-10 August on a 500 Acre large private farm about 40 minutes away from Philadelphia.
The leader of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, previously known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most famous festivals.
In 1989 he took the lead of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also taken care of production, licensing concessions and organisational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, the Glastonbury describes as the most inspiring event in which he has ever been, says that his company and Melvin Benn work side by side to offer a European-style festival event to the area.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and are working closely with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We had negotiations with the city and the Commission were motivated and excited about this project.
Unfortunately, we have been stuck in police debates on the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
" Thankfully, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will eventually benefit the population."
C3 Presents has revived the Lollapalooza -Festival 2005 in the Grand Park Chicago, after having been profiled in 2002 together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the world of the festival.
The two events have been able to achieve $9.8 million and $11.8 million in gross taxes and taxes in 2007.
These two festivals take place in a urban setting.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, where the wetlands are located on the urban greenery," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to merge these two concepts in one way or another, at the same time, to convey the impression of a rural festival on the European and the American way."
Wineland is located about half the way between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Wineland, including the mayor, takes on the burden of this event with joy," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to award the terms of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are interesting enough to invest in such an event and to record a festival that will hopefully have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the recording capacity of the festival is "very large", in about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed yet when they were printed.
"Vienna will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse in the hope of attracting all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His partner of C3, who won the Top Independent Promoter Award for the last Bollboard Touring Awards, is Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
It is not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if no less than the Terminator opposes.
These lock tests are part of the delegated tasks.
A politically "heikles mandate", because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, is launching Runaway Productions.
Is it hard to negotiate with the Governor?
"You have to be careful because it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those who are considered for the best," he says.
The run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the promotion of the cinema is the top priority at the moment.
The search for the Oscars has begun.
At all the festival on the west coast, although Sundance, which was by Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will be about to present the films from Quebec to evaluate them and make sure that the producers have interviews.
The dark age had a successful performance at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and is presented at the 30th Star Denver Film Festival in November.
This month Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Does the stock exchange face an end-year rally? Disunity among experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With almost five weeks to the end of the year at the stock exchange, investors are already shaking their hands in view of the coming end-year rally.
Nevertheless, experts cannot create safe forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that it is purely statistical that the month of December on the stock exchange normally involves positive market developments.
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to create forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics.
While other experts do not welcome such a strong increase in the last few weeks of the year, they note that the exchange rate is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participant, which they invest mainly in pension funds due to the lack of safe stock funds, which are strongly affected by the upward trend towards the resulting assets.
As a result, according to these experts, the stock exchange will have a more side-by-side, market-affected trend, especially since we cannot yet estimate the extent of the possible decline in the interest rate of the U.S. notary bank, an uncertainty which is due in particular to the rising crude oil price and the risk of the rise in inflation rate.
Javier Barrio, president of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a good time to announce a leading market rally.
The chances are not very good, insured by the experts.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its peak on 8 November of 15.945,7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully close the year with almost 16,000 points each year due to the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional review of the pension fund undertaken at this time.
However, the expert points out that this year things could develop differently, especially due to the fact that the second week of December was already in progress, and then immediately after the day of the bridge to the Constitution, which will take place at the end of the year.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at the Reverses Bank, the previous market assessment is at an almost technical level, which could soon lead to a deviation from the index values that depend on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these turn out to be positive.
When selecting the values to advance the Ibex to new peaks, the analysts agree.
Solana by Intermoney estimates that this year the large values are in line.
Among the value winners, the expert would be the two major banks and some real estate companies, since the electricity sector will be expensive at the given time.
In the meantime, Federico Olucha assures the Inversis Bank that the growth will rise in connection with the banking and industrial sector.
If the Rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
In recent months, the ACS has been on a pick-up course and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will take the same route, says the expert.
With regard to increased consumer behaviour during the Christmas Day, the market will be determined in the last half of the year of periodic consumption.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technologies will also achieve positive results, even if they are represented only in a small number on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has only shown declines in two cases.
At the end of 2003, the technology bubble placed the stock exchange from its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real final year rally.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 to 28.17 percentage points were taken up, December showed a price increase of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will result in the fifth winning year (the Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and will also show an end-year anniversary.
Popular will have opened its 200 credit institutions from Monday to Friday for 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernise a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of these are located in Spain's most economically strong regions.
For the Institute, which operates under the name Popular Max, these branches mean a large milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, as popular as the first banking group is the leap to extend the opening hours of its branches to 20.30 a.m. and to set Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 8.30 p.m.
The BBVA banking group, which has also repeatedly read the extension of its opening times in the branches, has not yet reached a final decision.
The current negotiations of the Bank with the trade unions seem to aim at an agreement, with 75% of all branches closing on Saturdays and opening on a weekend, even if not for the customer.
Whether other banks join the new initiative, which adapts to business opening times, depends on the experience values of the Popular Bank.
And that is also the intention that the popular pursues with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches, which because of their position can capture the marketable knowledge of self-employed, small and medium-sized enterprises, but also those of large purchasing houses.
The Bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as these are not new but changed opening times.
For this purpose, the Bank will redesign the premises of those branches that are already in business zones and at the same time align them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
The extension of opening times is thus linked to a new space design of the branches, which is characterized by a more up-to-date, colourful design.
The competent bank representative, Ángel Rivera, assures us that the restructuring did not require more investment, but rather increased staffing, as a branch did not now require more than six, but eight or nine employees.
Sub-contracts that will even be equipped with additional facilities for SMEs will not be sold.
A positive experience for the group
Popularly, his concept has already been tested by nine branches in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, says Angel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donell and Gran Vía have been selected for what seems to have been a clever solution.
Popular is currently looking for around 2500 branches.
And another 60, operating under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized on immigrants and also show extended opening times, even on Sundays and holidays.
These branches of PopularMax do not use the BBVA model, as most of them will instead offer a wide selection of non-financial services for sale.
We don't want to compete for our customers, says Rivero.
With telephonica they have reached the agreement provisionally to sell mobile phones using external banking personnel.
The Spanish private broadcaster Telecinco doubles its stock exchange value for the first time, thus overcoming its rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence, the manager of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, met his satisfaction at the closing of the stock exchange. The broadcaster led by him had his value increased twice by his rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: that's exactly what hurts me; not that we had higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he noted.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they did not fall too far.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with a 2.54% plus.
This gain reduces its previous losses to 15.66% this year.
According to Bloomberg, the company's value is now EUR 4,488.88 million, with Mediaset controlling the main share of the capital (52%), and Vocento is only 13% involved.
The rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and since January has reported a total loss of 40.5%, so its market value is 2.193.46 million to half.
On the other hand, the market value of other listed communications companies increases; in the case of Sogecable to 3.571 million, in Prisa (publisher of Cinco Días) to 2.518.53 million and in Vocento to 1.779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be seen from the fact that it is two similar companies, according to Vasile.
Of course, the question still arises as to the extent to which we can actually act technically, at what price and how we can make it on a customer level.
Telecinco explained his plan a week ago to raise more than 1,000 million gross profits from advertising revenue to the first television show this year. This insured Guiseppe Tringali, the manager of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the advertising company of the group.
If the project should be implemented, the sender would increase its advertising revenues compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year by 3.6%.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine stock exchange months (up to 734.4 million), while net revenues from television business could only increase by 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor for Telecinco's better stock exchange rate compared to the high payout ratio that the company was able to display up to now: in 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarría launched a 100 per cent dividend expansion.
However, Vasile assures that after the purchase of 33% of the shares of endemol, with mediaset as a parent company, the ratio could still vary, even if it is too early for an official announcement.
We are obliged to pay at least 50% of the shares, even if we have so far said much more.
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose stock values we have already been able to increase by buying 33% of the endemol shares.
According to the analysts, the market is currently experiencing certain trends of loss.
Lehmann Brothers only recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is due to the decrease in the expected growth rate, which will fall from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This has also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 for 2008 by 4.5% and for 2009 by 7.5%.
3 Options.
1.
Ibersecurities: puts on its high effective return and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: measures Telecinco (buy) due to the multiple incentives and the prospering market a more advantageous position with antena 3 (holding).
3.
JPMorgan: In view of the similar threats (satisfied market and worse economic climate), it is recommended that the expectations be restored in both cases.
The Congress endorses the MIFID Directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel to the parliamentary drafting, which was concluded today by the Congress decision of the Senate on the supplementary/amending proposals for the draft, the Government published the provisions of the new law with the aim of enabling the two regulations to enter into force by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously commended the efforts of Congress and Senate Members who had pursued the objective of establishing the best possible arrangements to ensure investor safety and regulate the individual business activities in order to guarantee a generally efficient market.
In addition to modernising the financial markets, the MIFID, which redesigned the securities service system, aims to improve investor protection, increase the control claim of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and promote cooperation between the various European Union control authorities.
The new Directive enables specialised companies, as well as natural or legal persons to offer financial advice and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services undertakings (ESIS), consulting companies that are associated with investment and brokerage companies of securities.
In addition, it extends the number of financial transaction systems, so that the regulated markets are added to the multilateral energy trading systems and to the systems for the internationalisation of trading orders, which would eventually compete with the current economic operators.
The law obliges investment companies to register the focus of their corporate profile, the confrontation and the forms of dealing with risks on the kundjutun market and all projects carried out to facilitate the control task of the CNMV.
The Economic Commission for Congress subsequently made further changes, with the decision that the debt write-offs provided with titles now have to be considered as a complex financial instrument for the investor due to its high level of risk due to the US mortgage and banking crisis. (US mortgage crisis)
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal restriction of the working areas of graduates of economic scientists was used; 30 years after 1977 the regulation, which restricted the working areas reserved for economic scientists, was adopted.
The Senate, for its part, established new positions in the financial sector, how the economic intermediary who works on a foreign account does not require authorization from the CNMV and can offer its services for the commercialisation of products and for the recovery of several investment companies at the same time.
The harmonised consumer price index (VPI) increased by five decades in November and is now at 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess the inflation rate within the European Union provides the average price developments in Spain in November.
Its publication is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which aim to compare local and quality data with US products.
The forecast for the indicator can be established in advance by applying the same procedure as for the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using several other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) recalled that the pre-defined indicator was only used as a benchmark and therefore did not have to comply with the final result announced on 14 December.
The consumer price index (VPI) will remain at a relatively high level
According to the Deputy Government Chief and Finance Minister Pedro Solbes, the increase in GDP in November was a temporary development; at the same time, it ensured that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
However, sunglasses in the conference halls found that even if the current figure is not good, Spain's inflation gap with the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also explained that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, in which the government did not expect such a high increase.
We expected a value of around 4% , the Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance announced with regard to today's published forecast.
Virgin calculates revenues of over 42 billion euros in the next three years
The assets of Northern Rock have decreased by more than half, after the Bank had been crisis-dependent in mid-September last year by the British notary bank for an emergency credit, and they currently amount to only 12,000 pounds (compared to EUR 16.800 million).
At that time, the Bank's assets amounted to £25,000, a sum that was significantly reduced within two and a half months by the loss of trust of customers, and despite the 100 per cent guarantee from the government that the money will be safe until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would continue the group after its acquisition under the brand name Virgin Money, has to invest about a quarter of British banks' incomes, which will be made up of the facilities for the next three years, in order to acquire exactly those 18 billion pounds that are still needed to achieve their target of 30 billion.
The Group of the Multimillionaire Richard Branson, known for his outstanding advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to make $50,000 million (approx. 70 million) flow annually into advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock called this week the Virgin Group, in which three other companies are involved, as its preferred bidder to lead it out of insolvency.
The Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged suspicion of involvement in urban corruption
This morning, the Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the town of Totano (Partido Popular) belonging to the town of Murcia, due to the urgent suspicion of development in urban corruption that was discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretary of the municipality and the chief of the community police were arrested.
Last May, José Martínez Andreo represented the office of Juan Morales, currently a member of the Popular Party and then president of the municipality of Totana, and could, according to information from the broadcaster Cadena SER, be the original wireteller of the plot.
Officials continue to search the business documents of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer was accused of being the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered at the beginning of this week.
According to information provided by Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular and consequently privileged MP Juan Morales was arrested when he left his client's residence on the basis of important heavy documents to be related to the plot.
In addition, other sources of information from the alleged payments of morale to a Galician construction company that foresees the conclusion of a city-building contract in which the construction of a large area of 200 hectares was decided.
At present, eight people are in investigation.
Bono agrees to accept the candidate of the PSOE in Toledo and, in the case of an election victory, to the Congress.
Former Defence Minister José Bono has adopted the offer of the Prime Minister and Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. He will then present the list of PSOE candidates in the upcoming General Elections in Toledo and, in the event of a election of Socialists, will take over the office of Congress President.
This is how José Blanco, Organisational Secretary of the PSOE, and Bono announced in the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero took place at the party headquarters today.
According to the Chief of Government, the offer to the former minister is justified, since it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the event of a victory for the Socialists in the upcoming elections, the Mancha politician would all appear to be the chairman of the Congress for the party.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as President of Congress, who had announced last November 15th that he would no longer join the next general election to end his career in public policy and instead take part in the university field for climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that since his resignation two years ago, the Prime Minister had been constantly pushing for his return to political affairs.
In addition, he pointed out that the party, as the Vice-President for Economic Affairs did not want to prevent citizens from taking over the presidency of Congress in the event of an election, and called this an act of transparency .
If he should actually take over the office, he hopes to turn the chamber into a house of respect and not the insult or scream to make it appear to the citizens more and more similar.
Regrettably, from time to time, one gets the impression that the only place where you can't talk in Madrid is the Congress; the president of the Senate was interrupted up to 26 times.
At the same time, he commended current President Manuel Martín and his good work and indicated that he did not want to arouse the appearance of having already taken over the office, otherwise his political opponents would call it arrogance.
Weather Forecast
Since the climate debate is subject to criticism from both the climate change skeptics and those who put a social and political debate at the forefront of this issue, the movement as a whole must bring about strong cohesion.
Especially when it comes to a leader of the movement, who, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change to be more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
However, this proposal brings him to a statement on the action, or non-trade, of his Government, which has made a decisive contribution to Spain's being at the top of the EU, which has at least met the Kyoto Protocol's requirements.
Who are the ones responsible for the failure to meet the requirements on which sectors this is to be based and why his government, which proposed the treaty with the planet, has not stopped this development.
In addition, it is now obliged to provide the Spanish citizens with the measures it intends to take against climate change without any change.
What companies will be affected, what behaviour of citizens should be changed, what individual and collective savings measures must be implemented, and what economic consequences this will have.
More precisely, who needs to sacrifice and will pay for saving the planet.
However, it has and will not give such explanations in the future.
Just because it's about sacrifice and payment.
Because the measures that can be implemented against climate change are unencumbered.
They are cost-effective, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the petrol cent proposed by the PSOE appeared selectively strategically dangerous, so that it was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it now applies to save the planet with nothing, i.e. with pure propaganda and empty tongues without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, the Commission, committees, protocols and new offices.
With its treaties with the planet, the other politicians so suitable for election campaigns must neither speak nor accuse nor demand, but instead follow the demanding issue of decorating the meetings and exhilarating others with his mildness and goodness.
But this can only be done if the contract does not deviate from its pure virtual nature and therefore does not provide that the bicycle will be the only means of transport in the future or that we can only be refreshed with a specialist.
The mayor and police chief of Totana due to alleged development into urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the town of Totana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo, of Murcia. In addition, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel entrepreneur were also taken into account for alleged suspicion of city-building violations, today it was called investigation circles.
The city council was arrested at its residence, from which it was taken to the municipality and in whose premises it is until now surrounded by numerous agents who were also involved in the city administration and the municipal construction of Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are linked to the last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, which showed that more than 2 million hectares of unresolved construction ground for urban projects should be redesigned under the leadership of the Galician construction company Nuaria, which should build 4000 apartments on the property, after the local administration has read illegal commissions to it during the last legislative period.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested directly, but were subject to an investigation procedure, which is initiated and carried out by the first court of Totonas.
The first six detainees were brought before the judge today.
According to the statement of investigation circles, Juan Morales is also identified against the former mayor of Totana and currently independent PP deputy.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, the owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current resident friend in Murcia, is suspected.
The president and owner of the group Nuaria , the lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A. from Vigo, was arrested in the town of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the manager of Suelo de Inmonaura Pablo José M.G., whose company was intended to operate as a sub-group of Nuaria and have received the butter money.
The investigations shall be carried out by the Municipal Authority against urban crimes, under the supervision of the Central Unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven further investigations, most of them in companies directly linked to the arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally well-known poultry farm, which should have acted as a midwife.
The Nuaria building group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in Murcia, which should include more than 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
In Totana, the company acquired over 2.2 million square kilometres of area to be rebuilt. The aim was to carry out a construction project that would raise the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonar, which promote the sale of property; Conyase, which operates the parking spaces of Coruña, Venezuela and Plaza Fernando el Católico in Vigo; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the direct marketing sector and Preconiza, specializes in the promotion, sale and installation of building materials.
Things That Can Happen
1.
If you agree, we will turn away from the expression of the book of the month and instead try to invent a price designation of other names with corresponding competences.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course you are cordially invited to make your suggestions.

Our Finnish correspondent explains yesterday's comment in the most important Finnish newspaper, the Helsinki Sanomat, (Finland is also at the top of the PISA study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper on November 18th; it was by chance on the day on which the issue included criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of the philosophy section has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy around the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murder is an abiturant who quoted in his news the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
In an interview with the daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, the president of the Board of Education for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, asked teachers to take a more critical position towards Plato and proposed to delete Plato's teaching from the sub-level curriculum for Philosophy in Gymnasia.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a violation of the law that would be subject to six months of imprisonment.
But if you steal a music store at a value of 400 euros again, this only applies as a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal the business up to a value of 1000 euros, then the theft is a criminal offence, yet the penalty falls less than when a download is made (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you listen to a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is still lower than when downloading it (Article 244.1).
D. It is less important to participate in a fight than to exchange music data.
A prison sentence of between three and 12 months after involvement in a rebel dispute (Article 154 of the Criminal Code), while the data exchange has resulted in a six-month prison sentence of up to two years.
(Article 270 of the Penal Code).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment at the workplace is considered less bad than downloading a DVD film from the Internet.
F. The trade in copyright-protected films, whose author's authorization has not taken place, is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, well, if my colleague should be right, then someone has made his demands very well.

My house doctor sends me one of his long, strange research articles entitled: Money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially when the others get more of it.
So the feelings generated by the monthly payroll depend on the level of the colleagues.
The study was developed using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the latest edition of the scientific journal Science.
According to the statement Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonner Brain Research Centre Life&Brain, the activation was the strongest when the participant gave correct answers and his partner failed.
The researchers were able to recognize that the brain activity was always very moderate if both participants were correct in their response and thus received the same level; but if one of them received the double, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it actually requires so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The Balkan State Attorney
Carla del Ponte has been a victim of the Balkan War criminals for eight years. Her office is in the state prosecutor's office of the criminal court of the former Yugoslavia, based in La Haya.
Their mandate will run out at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a tearing and smiling eye, as the main leaders of the massacre of Srebrenica - at the death of eight thousand Bosnian Muslims - are still free on foot, namely the former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic.
Their names are on a list by the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach as a template for the title of his documentary films La Liste de Carla (2006), a film that follows the Swiss state attorney from Belgrade to New York with the pace of a police triller in order to track the escaped criminals and put pressure on the respective governments to narrow their networks.
What insurance is best for me?
The KFZ insurance, which covers a possible accident caused by the driver, includes a high cost burden, which is once again dependent on various factors, including age, gender, the date of creation of the driver's licence, family status, the type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
To own a car is only the beginning.
Because it's even harder to find the right KFZ insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, it has to be clear what we have to do here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurance policyholder.
This agreement shall be concluded in writing by means of an insurance contract which provides that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and is obliged in return to submit, in the event of an accident, the corresponding amount of the acquisition.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance consisting of several factors, including age, gender, time of creation of the driver's licence, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance undertakings shall determine their prices according to the statistics, so that higher contributions are also due in case of a higher accident.
For this reason, both over 25 years of age and women must make less contributions, as statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate due to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, since they tend to tend to be less than single persons, according to the statistical values and therefore, according to the firm's belief.
The benefits to be measured on the vehicle affect the frequency of driving and thus also the probability of an accident.
The more frequently the use, the more likely the damage.
When drawing up the premium, the insurance must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver also needs to study the situation thoroughly in order to choose exactly the car insurance that meets his personal needs.
We are now listing the most important points that should be taken into account when selecting insurance in order not only to be able to make a performance, but also to make a price-oriented choice.
The 25-year-olds meet many obstacles when choosing affordable insurance, such as low driving practice and the young driver's license.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance policy to complete full-time insurance, there are still more expensive alternatives.
The prudent drivers can choose a full-cask with self-interest, so that the benefits of a full-cask insurance are covered but offered at a low price.
This type of contract requires the customer to pay part of the amount caused by the damage itself.
The amount is determined before the contract is concluded and according to the amount of the insurance premiums. This is the lower the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, Spain's chief representative at First Europe, a brokerage company for online insurance.
Another option is the extended insurance that ensures the customer against external accidents, but not against the damage caused by the car itself.
Furthermore, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's a tip.
If you are under 25 years of age, it is up to you to reduce insurance costs; thus your benefit increases by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit card is a reduction in the basic salary of the insurance company concerned.
On the contrary, a penalty includes an increase in tariffs.
The amount of allowances and penalties depends on the company and its income.
If the company has a successful year behind, it can allow itself to increase the bonus payments, Noguera explains.
As soon as the 25-year-old brand is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract. The reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving practice the accident rate decreases.
Thus, it is most meaningful to decide on a full-time insurance with self-interest.
As a rule, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, explains the Spanish head of the European company, and adds that most of the accidents occur in the second year of practice after the fear of the beginner has been removed.
However, it is advisable for a married client who does not have children to complete full-time insurance; of course, only if it allows the financial situation of the person concerned.
On the side of the insurer, couples with children as the customers with the lowest accident rate apply, and therefore their contribution payments fall too low.
In this case, a full insurance with self-interest (in the case of an amount of EUR 300) would be the best option. If you have received a high credit card, an extended insurance is recommended, which only applies to the third year of the vehicle.
They drive a lot more relaxed and have a bigger purchasing power that allows them to make a higher contribution, Luis Noguera states.
For pensioners it is proposed to complete full-time self-employment insurance (in the case of an amount of EUR 150), or an extended insurance which is only used with a sufficiently high credit.
Finally, it must be noted that car insurance is very important not only because it protects the driver from possible accidents, but also because it entails high costs requiring a thorough selection that matches our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow hopes in Milan at the point for the eighth final
The FC Milan and the Celtic Glasgow will fight for the point they lack on the coming Tuesday in San Siro to reach their respective goals even before the completion of the Champions League. The Italians need the point to reach the top of their group, while it decides on their participation in the shots.
The Italian team has already got five points and have already confirmed their participation in the fifth round with an undecided in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow with nine points still needs another one to make sure that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not include Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two games of Group D will take place one week before the end of the sixth round, as FC Milan will have to join the FIFA World Cup in Japan, where he will fight for the first time at the 13th half-final for the entry to the 16th final.
Thus this group will be concluded above all and the undecided in the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the expected outcome, even if both teams are trying to win. The Italians will not speculate at home because the Celtic Glasgow knows that in the event of a victory, they would have a better starting position in the eighth final.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even qualify for a fall in a sleep of the FC Shakhtar. However, he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because at nine points, the Ukrainians were allowed to participate; they had lost last week in Glasgow (2-1) but could win in the second game (2-0).
Thus, the Milaners will try to miss the shots in the evening. They hope to reach the eighth final of the redesigned Champions League for the second time, after being defeated in the leading season in exactly the same round by a Kaka door in the copy time (1-0) and by a zero to zero undecided on the example.
While the FC Shakhtar is waiting for the victory of the Rossoneri, the team will have to focus on its own game, since both the achievement of the eighth final and its membership at the UEFA depend on its victory and a defeat of the Celtic Glasgow.
Despite his lower position in the table and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the greatest European championship, Benfica Lisbon could win the third place by winning and thus join UEFA.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
In the Canadian Vancouver, the Spice Girls gave 20,000 viewers of the opening shot for their first tour after the band was dissolved in 2000.
Posh Spice (Victoria Beckham), Scary Spice (Melanie Brown), Baby Spice (Emma Bunton), Sporty Spice (Melanie Chisholm) and Ginger Spice (Geri Halliwell) just prior to the start of their concert at the GM Place de Vancouver Stadium, the mood in the reunited band was excellent.
About 20,000 people were able to live at the sold-out stadium, where a video was shown about the history of the band, which had provided for furore in the late 1990s.
The reunification and the world tour overlap with the release of a new album, which includes its biggest hits and two more new songs, headslines and voodoo, which appears in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore golden bracelets on the stage that had previously been given by the husband of Posh Spice, the English footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the fans in the audience who brought the GM Palace to shine, although the nerves of his wife Victoria had banned it in the previous days.
While preparing for the show, Victoria Beckham said that the British star had not received our wardrobe once and for all, and that is why I am already very excited about what he will hold by the performance.
Sporty Spice , whose withdrawal from the group in 1998 due to internal differences of opinion two years later the resolution of the group was followed, expressed her nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world's public had changed, that the feelings of the Spice Girls had changed.
And that's why I didn't really think; so I'm glad to have made this decision, Chisholm spoke of the separation of the band that she had caused nine years ago.
The singer also said that the disputes had been eliminated and that everyone was happy again.
However, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
The group first arrived in Vancouver in a special machine from the Virgin Airlines, according to a report from the TV broadcaster CTV.
On their arrival at the airport, the band was received by an army of children's girls.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform as next in California, in San José (December 4th) and in Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
In Madrid they will enter the stage on 23 December.
New threats to the natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute rages between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk that Russian exports from fuel to Western Europe will be affected.
Most Russian exports of natural gas to the European Union (EU) are led by Ukraine and every dispute between the two nations is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it must pay for natural gas, it will take into account higher transit charges from Russia.
A previous conflict between the two countries in the last year reduced deliveries to the EU countries.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow has occurred at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly of Gazprom try to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be calculated more, as the Group has agreed to pay up to 50% additional for natural gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for imports of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit countries in talks," said Ukrainian Economic Minister Anatoli Kinakh of the Reuters News Agency.
"The changing global gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit charges [after Western Europe] over Ukraine."
In the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom reduced deliveries to Ukraine.
This led to a case of exports to Western Europe, which resulted in prices being drastically higher.
Russian gas accounts for one quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas emissions, but many of them remain underdeveloped.
The consequence is that Gazprom complements its own stocks of gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve the controls of the pre-trial register for workers from outside Europe, a member of the inspection body said.
The recommendation of the Chief Financial Controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought in conjunction with the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish State Health Service did not have any specific ideas about the number of foreign employees.
However, his report pointed out that other important controls were carried out correctly during a sample by five health authorities.
The Chief Financial Controller investigated staff recruited outside the European Economic Area as a result of the attack on the airport of Glasgow.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after driving a parking car through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in the Old Bailey in October in a video transmission and was charged in connection with the alleged car bomb attack in Britain.
Public health services are expected to carry out checks in the event of the appointment of foreign staff to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experience and authorisations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the public health authorities use Discover Scotland to check pre-trial registers, the Agency does not have the competence to receive this information outside the UK.
In addition to other recommendations, the Chief Inspector's report states that the Board should take action on guidelines for the withdrawal of the criminal record, which help employers to control in different countries.
"Even though we have found indications of these controls in some staff documents, they have not been carried out routinely," the report noted.
Black said that the Scottish health authorities would follow their research guidelines before employment to a large extent, but added: "Our report shows areas where the system can be improved to ensure that precise information on the number of foreign health workers is available."
BMA President-in-Office of Scotland Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations in the event of the appointment of potential NHS employees would identify people who could be involved in future terrorist attacks.
"The report says that the current preliminary testing of the NHS Scotland works well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will be," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the majority of them doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number is likely to be higher, also because the executives have problems identifying those employees who are allowed indefinitely.
The investigation continued to show that the established control procedures of NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian were largely respected.
These include passports, work permits, and qualification checks.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for pre-employment controls for foreign personnel in the NHS.
The Secretary of Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "It was a matter for me to carry out this work in view of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
It added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines regarding control investigations in the event of the recruitment of all employees - including those from abroad - would be reflected in the planned publication of the report next month.
Joy Division Dominated Film Award Award
Control, the film biography about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has received five awards at the British Independent Film Festivals, including for the best film.
Awards were also awarded to major performers Sam Riley, who worked in a camphouse before being cast for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and co-sponsorer Toby Kebbell.
Lady Judi Dench was the best lead actor for the Thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And the band performer Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for taking the British film into the world.
The prizes were handed over at a ceremony in London's Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis's rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at 23 years of age.
The black and white film - on which the Soundtrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Order can be found - was turned for only 3 million British pounds.
Nevertheless, he has introduced two prizes to the Dutch photographer Corbijn, which has so far been the first known for the cultive cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree, as the best director and the best director.
Rockmusic was the focus of another award winner at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film about the Clash singer Joe Strummer was awarded the award for the best documentary film.
The award for the best performer went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a Russian mafia boss in David Cronenbergs in London playing Thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who is called to play hard guys, has won the Richard Harris Prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Biest, is currently filming the Indiana Jones Continuation The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the prize he was named after Camelot and Harry Potter Star Harris, who died in 2002.
"It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He is my type of man, a great actor of his time, I am truly honored."
The independent film prices, known as bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa Supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia discovered yesterday that it had arrested 208 soldiers for belonging to cells who had planned a major attack on an oil plant as well as on spiritual and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells had planned to smuggle rockets.
Al-Qaida supporters have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an ally of the United States since 2003, as a result of the invasion in Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign citizen, attacks an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the TV report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000 men strong rapid intervention troops to protect the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006 after a failed Al Quaida attack.
The report, referring to a ministerial statement, says that 18 of the detainees belonged to a cell led by a "missile expert" who illegally immigrated to the country.
He reports that the militants had planned to smuggle eight missiles into the Kingdom.
Another 22 of the detainees reportedly had to kill spiritual and security forces.
The government has warned the clergy to do more to stop Saudis who are trying to join with Al Qaida militias in Iraq who want to fight the Allied forces and the US-supported Shiite Muslim government, which is seen by the hardliners under the Sunni Saudis as a heretic.
Al Qaida militias viewed many in Saudi Arabia as collaborating with the authorities in support of the politics of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaida who was born in Saudi Arabia to target the provincial Saudi government - have looked at foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy sector installations.
"This has been a very great effort of the security forces over the past five months," a spokesperson from the interior ministry told the state television.
The arrests also involved a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to advertise for the "Takfiri Think" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims, which supports violence against Muslims, which is being marked as unbelievers and firemen.
Among the prisoners, 32 people were also accused of providing financial support to militias.
The climate on Venus could give you an insight into the future of the earth
The Venus was perhaps once a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spaceship on a orbit show that the planet is even more like a distant twinkle of the earth than it has ever been.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to the earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and have similar orbits, but the Venus of the Sun is something closer.
Billions of years ago, Venus would have ruled under conditions that were very similar to those on earth and could even have been habitable, faithful scientists today.
However, due to the most unfavourable carbon dioxide greenhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower rotational rate, Venus started a completely different developmental course.
Today the planet is robbed of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the Venus Express space probe of the European Space Agency, which has examined the plants for one year, offer a sobering view of how the earth could develop in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Physics Department at Oxford University, one of the leaders of the Venus Express Mission, said: "It will be clear why the climate on the Venus is so different from that of the Earth, while the planets are quite similar."
"Our new data enables us to construct a scenario in which the Venus has begun billions of years ago, like the Earth, possibly with a habitable environment."
"Enriched Uranus" by the police
A kilo of radioactive material, according to reports of enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
One police spokesperson said that three people were arrested and that the material was being examined.
He did not confirm whether it was an enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000).
Everything is still open
While Romeo said he did not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the presidency finally declared ready to put a debate on YouTube, in which normal voters take questions on video and submit them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday, 28 November, were as ridiculous as the snowman who questioned the Democrats about global warming in the other party's YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflect precisely the situation of the Republican Party, which is going to end in the elections next year.
It is not known, just like the CNN producers who supported the debate with the candidates who selected YouTube clips to show.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, the longest one devoted to a single topic, immigration was at the heart of the debate.
The issue is one of the most striking issues for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecided voters to serve an electoral record when they heard things that felt like them: the TV company noticed the tops of the consent when the candidates spoke strictly about the boundaries.
The strongest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national frontier, and Romney, who has moved forward in the crucial polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to discredit the call for illegal immigration when he was the mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants for work at his house.
The two asked themselves particularly as interrogators whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (the illegals would give a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado Congressman, managed to hack into this issue.
None of the two men have serious opportunities to nominate, but they both remain in the race, perhaps because they've used to be tougher than others for immigration.
At least in the area of immigration, candidates share the same views in large and large: stricter boundaries, intolerance against illegal migrants.
This theme, together with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans to forget or minimize the differences between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic than other issues.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he has supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drunkenness should be considered torture.
One of the interrogators asked whether the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to believe that although the Bible is his favorite book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another prosecutor asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now opposite all expectations in the first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty is painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to defend Jesus, he laughed at them and said that Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains exceptionally wide open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with Ron Paul's recent donations and his accident storms in the debate on Wednesday.
These two are shot out of nowhere because the two birds of the party have so far not been able to agree on one of the most famous and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate began to unite the party from the beginning and convincingly combined with a victorious message about the size of America and a twist to both the party's wings.
This time the party is split and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to collapse; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly fun.
No title seems to be sold, no politicians paid for Paris hotel bills, no extraordinary tows were lost.
But the discovery that a rich businessman has spent more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million pounds) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this, is something that would have come out well without the fighting Gordon Brown.
When two months ago the Prime Minister withdrew the request for election, in such a way that the intelligence of the British was policy-making by claiming that opinion polls did not influence this decision, there was hope that he would provide a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly keen representative of the Liberal Democrats, expressed it, the once feared brown from Stalin to Mr Bean has developed.
The unscrupulous rescue of Northern Rock, a bank hit, showed regulatory weaknesses and poor judgment.
Poorly thought-out proposals to amend the tax laws have forced companies against the government.
The tax authority's loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative fraud.
A trio of generals in rest began a rebellion in the upper house in protest against cuts in military spending: being a minister of the military, they claimed to be part-time jobs.
Now there are the various donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's Secretary-General (and her former CEO) has already retired.
None of this means that Brown cancels irrevocably in the direction of retreat.
Nevertheless, governments can achieve a turning point after which they feel it impossible to govern.
They do not like nor trust politicians, but they usually hold back their skepticism when a new army seizes the office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister will improve the situation, and he does not need to be there for a long time, this delay is over: the public service is beginning to disappear; the cabinet ministers are beginning to murmur; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is going to be defensive and aimless.
In a way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because he cannot claim to be a new person, unlike other political leaders.
If he wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax authority documents, for example, are linked to decisions that Brown made as Chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if he was not directly involved in Blair's mismanagement - as in the long "money for noble title" investigation of political party funding - the voters may assume that he was.
Still, Brown's situation isn't as bad as it looks.
The mistakes are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
Like Mr. Bean, no one has died, or has been completely deceived.
And the antidote, as painful as it may be, is to deliver what Browns, of course, have always promised Stalinist tendencies: a reliable, solid and easily brutal government.
The new gesture for political donations is a good example.
The Garboesque Abraham, who compares his gifts with his charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his goodwill.
That may be the case, but the decision about it was not his fault.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who rule the country.
Watt, who says he would have known about Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, of course, will have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's chief financial driver, who was told about the outstanding donations in October.
However, Brown is not involved so far: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these confusions, although most of the payments were made after his taking office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he watered this resolve by taking action after a known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - in order to make the measure complete, by a bishop in rest and a judge.
In this case, the "treasures to be drawn from" are not very complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a matter for the police.
Apart from this, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, like finding a permanent chairman for the Independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been unemployed for six months, and moving forward with a comprehensive reform of political party funding.
This would require the hardliners of the Labour to cooperate with the Conservatives and perhaps to give up the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party owner such as Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some party facts.
The Conservatives now have a clear leadership in the opinion polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can achieve a victory is through unquestionable justice and solid competence.

Does the credit crisis in America start the credit card market?
If blood is in the water, it is only natural that back fluids stir up.
Now that America's real estate market is failing, the predators have the country's credit card market in sight.
Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the risk of underfunded loans spread to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both the bookings and the column rates that measure the share of the loans that are not deductible or too late for more than 30 days.
Last month, HSBC announced that it had taken a $1.4 billion charge from its US consumer funding, partly because of the weak credit card users.
Still, it's too early to panic.
Losses and columns are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody, the third quarter column rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in the Councils can be partly explained by technical factors.
An amendment to the US Private Solvency Law in 2005 resulted in an abrupt case of competitive notifications which are, in turn, a large part of the loss of Cedit Cards; the number of applications (and thus a fee) would increase again, whether or not the general conditions for creditors worsen.
Industry also reports strong payment rates that show how much of its debt consumers pay every month
and confidence in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the silence in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research company, estimates that spending will ultimately be 25% higher for 2007 than last year.
There are certain direct channels of infection between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: it is more likely that consumers will accept credit card debt, now that home credit is out.
However, card issuers look at the cash flow instead of capital values, so falling domestic prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the credit value of the creditor.
You can even be of benefit to card exhibitors.
The incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates are reduced if the properties are less valuable than the value of the loan; as a result, card debt becomes more important under the repayment priorities.
Card issuers can also respond much faster and more flexibly to the stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid reassessment of assets.
"We will not wake up one day and re-evaluate the loans completely," says Gary Perlin, Capital Ones Chief Financial Rapporteur.
Even if a sudden cover-up crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable dwindling are much more real.
If lower domestic prices and a credit reduction in America are forced into recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a more gruesome future.
Keep them looking for these shark rivers.
British bankers confess guilty in the case of Enron
Three British bankers who should be brought before the court for their role in the fraud system with the former Chief Financial Officer of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their search into debt on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially had committed seven cases of fraud using telecommunications means to alleged conspiracy with fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was set up on January.
But during a hearing before U.S. District Attorney Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone was guilty of fraud by means of telecommunications.
The three former leaders of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, were known in Britain during delivery procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, its case is a loose end of an investigation initiated after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The charges originally filed against them in 2002 made Fastov aware that he was the aim of a government investigation into the Enron decline.
The charge against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claimed that they had come to Houston in 2000 to excite a fraudulent plot with fastow and his former top advisor Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron, which was controlled by Fastow, the architect of countless fraudulent Enron machines, who contributed to the company's venture.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank had valued its participation in the subsidiary at zero, but the three British men knew that it had a significant value.
A company under Copper's control acquired the bank's shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid copper $250,000 for participation in this company.
According to the claim, Fastow falsely represented Enron that the energy company would pay 20 million dollars to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the 20 million dollars went to the British bankers, fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while fastow, copper and others dropped about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, fastov was known in two counts of conviction for his role in Enron's Pleite.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year prison sentence in Louisiana's federal prison.
Copper is serving a sentence of three years and a month in an establishment in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was free on foot on the basis of a $1 million bond that required them to live in the United States pending the trial.
Enron, once the nation's seventh largest company, broke up in December 2001, after years of book-keeping tricks could no longer cover the billions of debts or make weaker businesses appear profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
The founder of Enron Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Schilling were convicted last year for their roles in relation to the Enron collapse.
Schilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were annulled after he died of heart disease last year.
Not quite down in Moscow
The price of an aircraft from the G550 Gulfstream brand, equipped with a roll-Royce engine and enough range to fly from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But this is Kleinfeld for some of the rich Russians.
"It offers room for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you asks for so many seats because it's for a private family or a corporate president."
Firer was at the Gulf Streamstand on the last Friday at the millionaire exhibition, a four-day organ of the consumption shown, which was held in a vaulted exhibition centre on the outskirts of the capital city.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury exhibits had been built, hoping to interest newly arrived Russians in everything, from Mahagoni-tagged yachts to diamond-bound car grills that would be suitable for 50 cents.
Firer carefully took a brilliant orange Porsche into view at the next exhibition stand.
"It's a nice car, but it's Kleinfeld compared to us," he said.
"According to the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Heated by an oil tree, the Russian capital seems so overcrowded with money like Dallas at its glossy times.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to enormous wealth and went to Europe in crowds where they were seen as materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi overflights of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians stand out as the world's most visible free money issuers.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share in gold mining.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, has attracted ideas about how to sell high-priced goods on markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, belonging to the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billion dollars, a total of 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires are in the second grade, worth a total of $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts from the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a panel of experts here.
(The World Bank says that 15.8 percent of the Russians lived under the minimum of existence in 2005.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweller.
She had for the first time visited the fair with the Russian brand dealer Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all exemplary and the men are all worth a fortune."
As they go through the halls on Sunday night, two real estate brokers, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, call themselves and their clients millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and tried to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Mrs. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothing she wore, like a rotary carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed primarily aimed at the new ones, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand in the barn for several hours to visit an attractive warehouse, which tastefully placed Cadillac Escalades, platinum bags, Mövenpick Ice cream, tailor-made billiards, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddyry.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a fair stand by the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a wall-large imitation of a rembrandt image of hand-painted blue mosaics.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in climbers."
In fact, the traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the kind of brand with limited numbers that would not market at a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousand people, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or simply tourists, pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show last Thursday, Roman Ersov, the general manager of King Koil Bedten here, said he had sold two $70,000 mattress sets, made of silk, cashmere and cotton, with gold thread.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, said that a company equipped the high-end cars with high-end alarm systems that his company had sold the green orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, said that a company that adapts luxury cars to customers' wishes, he would have sold three refrigerator grills for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which are similar to tied chain straps, for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car tire that was developed for a Russian casino owner, with memories that he had worn with colourful Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a roulette.
The cost: 22,000 dollars for a four-day replacement.
"The Russian millionaire, the street biker or a picture of his wife's face from a Cuban circus will not necessarily drive on these wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He will keep it in his 30s or 40s garage."
Even though many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not at the moment express much exclusivity in view of the increase in the real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they are probably already millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you believe."
Those who were not millionaires could at least do as if they were rich at a stand operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had installed four red telephone cells according to the British model, which were completely stacked with mountains of false millions of dollars.
Azad Karryev, the marketing director of the company, said his employees had printed 500,000 false bank notes for the millionaire fair.
Fitters continued to throw money around, mobile phone photos, while they refused in the middle of the exchange, to let friends cut, or simply to insert a few million.
"See, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," Mr. Karryev said.
Suspected operation at death in New Jersey
It was the day before the harvest dance festival that Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of Just a Little Healthier Restaurant here and watched as a car at the white Cape Cod opened two doors below the West Scott Avenue.
Soon after that, there was a police car.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the box car of the medical bodyguard," said Livingston, a restaurant supervisor, on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone was dead."
The authorities learned that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newarker Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether they died because of a procedure carried out by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon who did not identify the police and who worked at the West Scott Avenue 212 house.
The authorities have not yet found what has caused Mrs. Arroyos's death, and they hope that toxicological investigations, whose results could not be available for weeks, will help to clarify a mysterious death that has sent a grief through the leadership tip of the Newark Police.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to the police director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice has been widely known in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and hard-working," Mr. McCarthy said about Mrs. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She's on my Pitbull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was Jimmy Arroyo's wife, a former Newark police officer working for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesperson for Union County State Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said that investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorised surgical treatment.
"That's one of the ways," said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they had arrived at the house about 3 o'clock in the afternoon in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on site.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have reported little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't want to say if Mrs Castro was questioned by the authorities.
The investigators try to determine whether a part of the house has been used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where there is a giant rose-tree in the little front garden and a Dalmatian is standing behind the house.
A blue facade with "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfume - sat in the parking lot next to a door that led to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable value and helped him find himself in the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to pay attention to this or that one," he said.
"She was always here when I got here and she was always here when I went.
It was painful."
Hopes that the central bank will reduce interest will lead to an increase in the world stock markets
The shares ran on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after market openings that the Central Bank was trying to calm down the credit markets by further interest reductions, were reinforced by disturbing comments from the Vice-President of the US Central Bank.
The stock markets rose in London, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kahn, number 2 by Ben Bernanke, president of the Central Bank, said that the policy had to "flexibly and pragmatically" react to the ongoing pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm down sad markets, in view of the signs of rising credit tensions, Kohn said that the latest turbulence would have "turned back some of the improvements in market functions from the late part of September and October".
If there were to be increased turbulence, it would increase the possibility of further strengthening the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken up by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to step in and stabilise the credit conditions with new capital injections to US markets and possible further interest reductions.
The performances also helped to calm Wall Street down in the face of other bad news from the US economy, now that the sale of US real estate reached a new record depth in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence were underlined by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that they would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 per cent of their worldwide employees, in a cost reduction measure to compensate for heavy losses from their lost assets in the US mortgage credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these jobs will disappear in London, where the Bank employs 1,500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent to close at 13,289.40, while the widespread S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent to close at 6,306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standard values.
Germany's Dax index increased by 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
The resumption of credit pressure on the markets had previously been underlined after a strong demand for a three-month auction of guarantees from the European Central Bank granted to the European Trade Banks was granted a substantial 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the U.S. Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow up on other capital markets in London increased as the credit tensions increased the three-month "Libor" rates for lending between UK banks by 6.59 percent at their highest since late September following a continuous increase since 21 November.
England faced a decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each almost as difficult as the other.
Who's supposed to beat as number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the presiding officer, on at least a call under this special title, is here to help Chief Coach Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan decide to help, and because the table of High Morris, the English business director, is filled with applications for national voters, if not for those in part-time.
Anyone who does not get the sixth battle position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is undoubtedly.
It's never easy to find out exactly what makes it possible for a person to reach the top of his career, while someone else never gets above the lowest rank, sometimes from lack of happiness instead of ability.
It is not only in the cricket where the selection is difficult, where judgements are needed, which are always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to ascend?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same may be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or Tubby Banerjee should be transported, both intelligent young leaders with good conclusions that know the business well.
Whoever can say what the right class is for a cricket player, unless he is given the opportunity to swim or go under.
Of course, numbers have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the captain's eye at the right time when he can take a Wicket and a beater must get regular chances of ordering if he wants to impress as a one-day cricket player.
Catching the eyes of the selector is more complicated.
There were many who in the last season were better than, for example, James Anderson, who would appear to play in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison explained himself to be healthy and how the wind congregates into the net.
Anderson took 32 first-class tickets with 33 runs to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hoped for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at the Asgiriya Stadium can only be a question of view.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five WIckets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, still struggling to stick, who created the breakthrough to a significant test cricket player and who, although he scored a double hundred against Australia in Australia, may still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores will follow their conservative instincts and feelings for Shahs after further discussion of Boparas' youth excitement during today's network session at Asgiiya Stadium.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his outstanding and valuable 88 test debutings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundred and only six of Bopara, who is 22 years younger, and an excellent balance against turned balls.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West India in the test in Lord, his heimarena as a Middlesex player, and this, in addition to his immediate refusal by the voters as Vaughan, was healthy to take back his position for the next game, seems to have taken the swing out of his beat, which was still manifest in Bombay.
On the contrary, the all-in-one from Essex has a lot of pleasure in life.
He was impressed by nothing on a cricket site and his attitude was drawn from it when he had recently hit a four-wheeled vehicle in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to pick up his Vodafone (of course also a sponsorship) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had observed this from a distance, and say with enthusiasm, "Have you seen it?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he congregates his medium pace with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing to choose the right time another.
Maybe this is the actual art of selection.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which does not mean that Shah may not be there well if, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he is the one who will play here this weekend.
Bringing refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Qaida
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced persons whose funds or visas have run out, and others who hoped that the city would return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the rebels who had driven them out of their homes.
At Mansour Bus Station, before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operational with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned to private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I had seen on television and what I had read in the newspaper, about what happened in Baghdad, and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the militias of the militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to be returned to the present time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Scythian teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the Iraqi regime was not allowed to work.
His Scythian neighbors in Amariyah urged him to tell him that a local militia supported by the United States had contributed to disbanding Al-Qaida from its base in the west of the capital, and forced him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been evicted from his house in Sleich in northern Baghdad by an attack with hand grenades after calling on his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaidas.
He was back to fight.
"Two days ago some of my friends called me and told me that they started one of the anti-Al Qaida militias in Sleikh and that they needed my support and my boys.
That's why I came back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many reported that they had been attracted by the increasing peace in the capital since the US increase in troops and the growth of local "people affected" groups who were armed and in cooperation with the American military to defend their city district.
But more said about being forced home by visa problems and winning funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-year-old father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Czech Prime Minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people are probably fleeing from the sectarian death squadrons in the country.
"We went well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government forced the Iraqis to give no more visas to force them to return to Iraq," the Sunni pensioner said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who destroyed my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the decrease in violence is that Sunni people were scattered from Shikish areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have been left behind.
There are fears that a sudden flow of refugees will rescind sectarian tensions and conflicts will occur.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal country is leading vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one area of education do the Saar countries have the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I told a non-Saar country yesterday about 50 times that we are not French" - this slogan paints the smallest federal country self-ironically on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of Saarland, which is in place in the educational monitor of the Institute of the German Economy of Cologne (IW).
This is how the universities are working closely with the neighbouring countries from tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can complete their study with a double or even three-fold.
Consequently, the proportion of foreign students is 15.6 percent.
But the country children also bring the Saarland in an average number to the universities - many of them without a degree in high school.
"In Saarland, you use the vocational education system," says Axel Plünnecke, education expert at the IW.
More than every five young person acquires his or her degree at a vocational school so that Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combination of vocational and academic training is also relatively well developed.
According to the population, the dual course equipment is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has decreased by one third in recent years.
This is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed universities to a marketing campaign for engineering subjects.
"In the general education schools, we have launched some reforms after the first Pisa study," says a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education.
This is how the government conducted national comparative tests.
In order to start learning the children earlier, the last Kita year is free of charge - a model that is now also copying other federal countries.
Whether the student’s performance improves sustainably will only be shown in future comparative studies.
In Pisa 2003, the proportion of risk students decreased from 29 to 20 per cent.
Overall, however, Saarland did not increase as much as other federal countries.
The Bavarians are better off.
And in addition to the Saar countries, foreign language knowledge is not measured at Pisa - one could point elsewhere in this area.
Because the language of the neighbours is obligatory for the Gymnasia - even if the Saar countries are not French.
Chávez converts watches
In Venezuela, the clocks are almost different from the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez will be returning to the South American country for half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a joke figure.
According to the Venezuelan Official Journal, the clocks are set for the world time minus four and a half hours, according to a new law.
This gives the South American state a time zone that exists in no other country in the world.
The U.S. enemy Chávez justified his decision, among other things, that the United States of the world had set up a full-time division in time zones.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (place time) the termination of relations with neighboring Colombia due to a traffic accident.
The left-wing nationalist said that, as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains President of Colombia, he will not have relations with the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do this alone because of my dignity," said Chávez, who advocates a constitutional reform that the citizens of the island must vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would clearly expand his power in the country.
The trigger of the dispute was the decision of Uribe to withdraw Chávez's mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, in which it was about the release of hostages.
Uribe criticized Chávez on Sunday with his decision "to spit in his face".
Also in Spain, Chávez is all over the mouth.
A new mobile ringtone provides for Furore in the country: "Porqué no te callas" (Why don't you hold your mouth) is the sentence that has already downloaded more than half a million people from the Internet.
He was addressed by King Juan Carlos of Spain, who was generous at the recent Ibero-American summit by the constant interlocutors of the left populist and who had driven him through the mouth.
German threatens 2007 pay minus
Despite the strong economic situation, German workers are threatened with a real wage loss, according to a forecast this year.
Experts called a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic predictions.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, in 2007 employees could actually count less on the cash account than in the previous year.
"It is due to the modest wage development, the increase in value added tax and the price fluctuations in food and energy," said Gustav Horn from the Institute for Macroeconomics and cyclical research of the "image" era.
New burdens could also come from unemployment insurance on workers.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück said the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung", the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 per cent per cent per annum in the current situation is correct and reasonable.
However, the Federal Agency for Labour must not be in a position to ask questions about loans or grants at the federal level, the SPD politician was quoted as saying.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the price explosion in food and mineral oil products has been leading to the highest inflation rate for 13 years.
Total prices increased by 3.0 per cent per annum.
Venus is the hilly twinkle of the earth
Despite its life-enmities, Venus is thought to be more similar than ever: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and windmills in Poland, as they occurred on the earth in winter.
For almost three decades scientists have suspected that it shines on the Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has produced the evidence - it felt electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: the lightnings on the Venus shoot at an altitude of about 56 kilometers from clouds to clouds, says Christopher Russell from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "supply theory", lightning caused life on earth: thunder should have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there was ever life there, it must have been in the very early history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today there should hardly be anything alive on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on earth, it reigns with temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus may be the Devil's will of the earth, but it is a twin," said Russell.
Why the Venus, which is so similar to the earth in mass and size, has struck such a completely different development, is the fundamental question of the Esa mission.
The beginning of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, since since the early 1990s there has been no more probe specifically for the research of this planet.
The latest research results, which are now presented in several "Nature" articles, do not only stress the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system, according to researchers.
"They also show that the commons of our neighboring planet are larger with the earth than at first accepted," the essay tells.
In addition to the already well-known vertebral wind at the North Pole, researchers also found a cloudstorm at the South Pole, which is turning much faster.
The phenomenon reminds of air currents in the Earth's Winter Hemisphere, writes a research team about Giuseppe Picconi from the Italian Istituto di Astrophysica Spasciale e Physics Cosmica.
The two-tenth planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is almost as large with a diameter of 12.100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as morning or evening stars, orbits the sun in almost 225 days.
But it turns a lot slower around itself: A Venus day lasts 243 Earthdays.
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar hardly remembers the earth, scientists assume that both planets were created under very similar conditions.
On both, water was collected, which remained on the earth in the oceans, but on Venus was lost in space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on earth in carbonate stones, it makes up the vast majority of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends trade marks meetings with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands an end to the party dispute for the reception of the Dalai Lama in the office.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPD for its attacks on the Chancellor after the September meeting.
Federal President Horst Köhler has taken care of the view of Germany and has called on the great coalition to end the dispute to receive the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world on this issue," Köhler told the Trade Sheet.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding of the reception of the Dalai Lama by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity to me, even if I respect the diversity of cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knew that Germany had to strike a sensitive balance in foreign policy, the German president stressed, but Merkel took protection from the pre-deployment, and was running a new Chinese policy.
"The Federal Chancellor has not withdrawn from the traditional one-China policy.
China knows that too," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly identified the reception of Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from several Union ranks.
Among other things, Steinmeier had complained about the Union's 'window policy' in foreign policy.
After receiving the Dalai Lamas in the office, there were severe irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
Thus, the Chinese leadership not only launched the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD) but also, according to SPIEGEL, frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
Chinese government chief Wen Jiabao has now asked Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to admit the reception of Dalai Lamas as a mistake.
China refused when European politicians in official office received the religious leader of the Tibetans, Wen Jiabao reaffirmed the Chinese position.
The acts and words of the Dalai Lamas showed that he was trying to separate Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other provinces today, from China.
Schäuble warns against crows like in France
Street fights with the police, shootings, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against Krawallen as in France.
Everything had to be done to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany was not eliminated in violence on the street, the Federal Minister called for.
Barricades burned, Randaliers shot at the police with scrap flints: After the heavy youth riots in France, Federal Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) in Germany fears a similar development.
"We need to make sure that social explosives are not built up and released in violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said to the "New Press" that appeared in Hanover.
Not every young person is right with the rapid change in social reality.
Bonds, countries and municipalities were already working with emphasis on solving problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islamic Conference, the first success has already been achieved."
However, for warning, it is too early.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that there are no urban and sociological problems such as those in France in German cities.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people in the past nights had suffered serious street fights with the police.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Toulouse.
Greater integration efforts by the Federal Government demanded from the President of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the Krawale in France, Kolat warned against "follow-up effects".
The situation in Germany is not as fragile as in France.
However, there is still a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate for young people with migration background is "on average" under 25 years.
In particular, more training places should be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We must give young people a perspective."
However, the president of the Turkish municipality added that in Germany there is more "social control in the families" than in France.
Many young people with migration backgrounds also did not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat recalled, "But we still have to be careful."
Youth must be "quickly given the opportunity to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile, at night it remained largely quiet in the Parisian Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were in use, a helicopter overflew the area with fireworks.
The competent authorities reported three arrests, as well as a few burning garbage dumps and cars.
Since the day before, an offer of about 1000 security forces provides for rest.
The police will go through as long as it takes, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the capital.
On Tuesday night, about 80 policemen were injured in Krawalen in Villiers-le-Bel.
In the following night, the unrest came to grips with Toulouse.
The Krawale burned itself in a traffic accident where two young people died on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In the kingdom of Angela Wolke
The remote appearance of the chancellor shows that the coalition is content at the end - and that it is no longer expected of itself.
In what country does this Federal Chancellor actually live?
After her unresolved appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was grumpy and poor, one must say: not here - not in the country that should finally be governed by her.
The suggestion that they focus too much on foreign policy has been rejected by Angela Merkel with an angry over-the-counter sentence.
This was provincial, she said and only showed that she did not want to understand what the critics were talking about.
In the Federal Day, it has documented to everyone how much their rejection is worth.
There was no concrete interest or even a feeling about the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: a withdrawn politician who flees to foreign policy and stays there in the vicinity.
For example, climate protection: There she openly praises the decisions of St. Damm, but does not say how the climate goals should be achieved here.
At all, the self-lob - so much inconsistencies the CDU chief would have failed two years ago.
Now she's clinging to the floscule that the upsurge comes from people.
In this way, she damages her image as a pragmatist who solves problems instead of beautifully speaking the world.
But in the realm of Angela Wolke, domestic problems are a border appearance.
Children's poverty and the worries of the poor?
A few extra paragraphs have been left for her.
It is significant how often she promises when it comes to childcare.
Three runs need a brand to produce a half straight set.
She stumbles like on a foreign land when it becomes concrete.
Division of Attacks
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Middle Romney provide a hard exchange of beatings - and must now fear an external candidate.
The effort of the candidates is already on the first topic.
He has made New York a "place of refuge for illegal immigrants", and in the middle of Romney throws forward his rival Rudy Giuliani.
This counter, for its part, has heavy objections: "I would say that his own house was a port for illegal," said Giuliani and proposed to the former Governor of Massachusetts to employ private immigrants without papers.
The candidates are blaring about the attack: because the Republican base still has no clear preferences, the eight presidents use the debate on CNN in particular to discredit their opponents.
The self-directed 30-second videos that Internet users have uploaded via YouTube are hardly more than a benchmark.
"With this kind of isolationism, we have allowed Hitler to come into power," John McCain tells his opponent Ron Paul, who, as the only one in the round, is calling for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also receives strong reading from the Vietnamese veterans when he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding", a method of interrogation that is simulated in drinking as torture.
However, that the main topics of the campaign are beyond Iraq's war and torture debates, the reactions of the public in St. Petersburg in Florida show.
Whenever conservative values are always praised and future tax increases are rejected, the auditorium will fire an accident.
Once again, it shows where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," explains Romney, and presents to the base and television audience with a request that he be among the kidnappers in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes to his senses when he is asked to explain the Bible literally.
Musharraf reigns first in Civil
One day after his resignation as army chief, Pakistani power chief Musharraf has been appointed president.
This will end eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has been scheduled for another five-year term on Thursday.
The Pakistani television took over the ceremony in the presidential palace of the capital of Islamabad live.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his office as army chief to his trusted Ashfaq Kiyani and thus moved to international pressure from the United States in particular.
Eight years after his capture of power in an unblooded military coup, the former General now rules for the first time as civilian governor.
With his resignation as commander-in-command of the forces, Musharraf had met a key requirement of opposition and the West.
Another central demand is an end to the state of emergency that the Musharraf had hanged on 3 November.
As soon as he is released, Musharraf will, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, lift the state of emergency and thus meet a further demand from the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which had held the Musharraf after the suspension of the state of emergency at the beginning of November with its heavy lawyers, had rejected all objections to the contested re-election of the head of state on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four others injured in the northern region of the tribe of North-Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a road near the border to Afghanistan.
The Fathers of the Crowd Return
Germany's 7th Supergroup re-musics: The three band members of Harmony took their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
To the Revival there is an average of its great time "Live 1974".
At the time, they were much more famous abroad.
The enormous sensation then takes place in the form of three gentlemen seated at the evening table.
Each one has his chests in front of him, his cables and especially his buttons.
Dieter Moebius crowns in the flower white shirt with 63 years in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years old and in possession of laptop and guitar.
On the right, from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, concentrates on the console.
Everyone contributes to noise, including even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds to a traditional piece of music.
That does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
That the band harmonia re-musicated, has caused some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
What you can do here is to reveal: Targeted requests have shown that the name has been obscured by collective pop-memorial, but not so sustainable as to miss this band painfully for 32 years.
But why shouldn't the German also celebrate his living legends from the 1960s?
At the same time, what is misleading krautrock is more and more in England and America than in their own country.
When the music industry gave the survivors of the Cologne Group Can 2003 the Echo Prize for Lifework, they were seen in the hall in asking German pop-faces.
When the Red Hot Chile Peppers in Laudatio also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and New!, the surprise did not know the limits.
At the concerts Michael Rother later hacked at the Red Hot Chile Peppers on stage like an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and the declaration abroad is one.
That is why the memory has been exaggerated with harmonia, because the trio only existed for two years and at this time also developed a far smaller power than was subsequently assigned to them by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played music under the very promising name Cluster with the artist Conrad Schnitzler.
At first, they played in the basement under the Berlin stage.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a plate label maintained by the church.
Rother had recently helped with power plant and then played a call as a guitarist at New!, the perhaps radicalest German group at the time.
In 1973, however, Rother followed the Cluster musician into exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruins, they lived as fledgling municipalities.
Less ideologically than in the municipality of I, where Roedelius could still plague himself as a child.
It's more like a top-down artist.
Apparently, there was also a twist of the song club Harmonia Ottenstein and a name for the art.
Some people have stopped harmonia from doing so.
The first album was called "Music of Harmony" and the next "De Luxe".
Because so left and modest the music also sound, the band has a material need.
The travel collection did not serve only the self-esteem.
The CD now released "Live 1974" was cut off at a concert in Griesm, before a nearly 50-captive record show, as one would think.
Rother then came the desire to force and occasionally practise harmony.
For Roedelius and Moebius an unsuitable claim.
The band declared its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the esoteric spherical and secured his existence with albums like "Flaming Hearts".
Cluster was relived in the eighties and has been more successful since it was harmony.
The grey live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record company Greenland has set itself the goal of maintaining the tie as a clean German contribution to live music.
New! was already excavated like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmony takes place in the Berlin House of the World's Cultures.
Publicly subsidized, within the framework of the Wildtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, Altpunk and author of the handbook "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the Loveparade inventor Dr. Motte.
In order to outline the entire range of the influences of the tie on the following pop music.
Harmony fills the supergroup's empty space.
Brian Eno's sentence floats with the most unique sounds in the room: "The only true music, you belong to the future."
There are images that show producers with harmonia in the farm.
The legends serve projections of other black and white photos of our curved devices.
The three veterans are again involved in improvisation.
No longer by attaching microphones to the organ and to the drummer, to unlock unheard of sounds to the instruments of self-contained effects.
Today electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three to the technical deep Tüftler.
It also does not change the choir of the house.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgensterns, it is hosted and blown under sound clouds and sung in a beautiful place with the emphasis "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never Rock.
The roots were found less in the blues than in music schools (Can), technologies (power plant) or on the escape from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Whoever calls here "'68!" is not entirely wrong, and harmony cannot be brought out of it even now.
Even the most understandable is carefully considered on stage.
Where does music start, and when does it stop?
This can rob a person of the nerves or give him a moment of great happiness.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Morderic Peace", two films are again dealing with the Balkan War.
But they're not convinced.
Either the concepts put too much on action and ballers or they're too moving.
Richard Gere can't help in "The Hunting Party."
The good news first: Although war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but calculated there, in the dark background of the Bosnian War, the actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man in the 1980s because all too many roles in women's well-being films and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism caused a desire for perspective.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to "The Hunting Party - When the hunter becomes a hunter" (Why should film titles today always be as long and will be as long as driver tariff contracts?) perhaps to watch.
He provides a wonderful eyebrow presentation: Basically, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what might have been from Gere if the fate and the film industry were not so kind: a man who has long been behind all his best times, but who himself has preserved a considerable remnant of the unique charm as a ruinous monument of his descent.
But despite this trump, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production of "Mother peace", which also starts this week, only the endless series of failed Balkan war movies.
With "Morder's Peace" you can make a brief process: The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from Kosovo's hedgehogs, which he loves very quickly.
Although it is welcome that even here the Serbs are not represented as the sole root of all evils, the television film is lost all too quickly in ballers and action.
There's a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a motorway but for that with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be explored in a very exemplary way, why there has never been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters opening up to detect the Serbian super-war criminal "the Fuchs" might have become a new "Apocalypse Now" with another director and another screenwriter (both in Personal Union Richard Shepard).
Because the stories look like it: both times small teams go into the woods to accomplish something that the military cannot and both times it will be a journey in madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt does not simply let the down-down cynic be with his heart when he introduces us at the beginning.
No, the script must inspire him into another romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down the stream, when the reporters succeed in the last five minutes in the time-breaking process, what NATO, the CIA and all the world's money hunters have failed in five years: catch the war criminals and leave the Muslim Bosniaks to the fair.
This is so bad that you want to call the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against quinology.
The film has a most profound human concern.
He wants to start that Karadzic and Mladic are still walking freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (to be exceptionally united once) not to pursue the persecution too intensively because of secret political agreements.
But the good community and the evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht story comes to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work desk: "I can see with compassion the stutterers, indicating how eager it is to be evil."
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly the kind of skulls that indicate how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of Balkan war film.
Recently, this newspaper reported that all Iraqi films were Hollywood's big flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa film.
Almost always applies: If a star moves around on the crisis shepherds or mine fields of the world, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Outside all the borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio comes out.
Perhaps all the conflicts are still too small in time.
It had to go away for decades before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Some films will be ripened - the Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" that are now classics have not been celebrated in any way as master's works.
But maybe today, where every real-time mass murder comes home on the same two screens, we know too much about the world's conflicts.
And that robs the reverse writers of the carelessness that it takes to tell good stories.
"His or his" or "The Great dictator" has finally become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how badly the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you shouldn't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you need to have the sarcastic distant artistic view of Romancian Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about parallels between his historical novel "Lemprière's Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It's only because some things never change.
Cities will always be dangerous, people will always be brutally murdered and war will always prevail in Yugoslavia."
Criticism for Olympia Absage collected by Beust
The withdrawal of the mayor from the Hamburg application for the Summer Olympics has been severely criticized in politics and economics.
Many want to continue to fight for the games on the water.
But from Beust, realism reminds us when assessing the chances.
The chief businessman of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described a resignation on Wednesday as "not good for the economic situation".
No other project has developed as large motivational forces in the city as the Olympics recently.
"Without this objective, the sport policy shift could not be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to vetch the project, but to find a new long-term approach to "which comes from a changed time radius".
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday with earlier statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic contest, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the sports federation expected for early December on an application from Munich for the 2018 Winter Games.
"This preference means to us that we will have no realistic opportunity in the period we have so far considered by 2028."
Yet the dream was not dreaming all the time, said Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This will give the impression that Hamburg will no longer apply for the Olympics in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to get a chance to get together by making plans at this point," HSB President Günter Plöß said on Wednesday.
A refusal to apply was also in opposition to the President's statement on the occasion of a reception for the general meeting of the German University Sports Association.
There, Beust called the Hamburg application for the University 2015 "not as a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association had only nominated Hamburg as a candidate city last week.
The SPD-Citizenship Group advised the Senate not to use valuable time for housing construction in Hamburg.
"The development of the small grassbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has put on the map of Olympia and suspended the building of the apartment," said SPD deputies Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the Small Grassbrook has always required an integrated planning for Olympia and a later residential use, the CDU has unilaterally placed on the "event factor".
The application for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg, at the time, had caused great excitement.
Hamburg, however, was a failure in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
Whoever connects the terms of Sweden and wooden box is thinking of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently, woodboxes made in Sweden cast dark shadows on Warhol's work directory.
Most of the forty-nine Brillo boxes listed there from the "Type Stockholm" are fakes.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expresse" a few months ago had doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes of 1968, internal research at the Moderna Museum in Stockholm now results in a sobering result: The six "Brillo Boxes", which the former museum director Pontius Hultén gave to the Moderna Museum in 1995, are copies - and perhaps also the majority of the hundreds of other Brillo Boxes from the "Type Stockholm", which are in circulation on the international art market.
The history is distorted, a confusing chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol in New York created his first "Brillo Boxes", painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard cartons of the soap powder "Brillo".
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museum in 1968 - with Warhol's agreement - hundreds of brilliant boxes made of papa: These (for cost reasons) came not from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo cartoon factory.
It was not works of art, but examples of them, just pieces of exhibition.
At the same time, in 1968, Warhol granted permission to produce a few Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not published in the Modern Museum.
Contemporary witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes that were then entered into art and auction history as authorized original Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Boxes with the name "Type Stockholm" right into the art and auction history.
Some of them have reached more than $100,000 on auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that it had produced about a hundred wooden boxes in Sweden in 1968 and was exposed, which Warhol had left him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were only produced in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that time Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservator at the Moderna Museum, has also examined three of the six museum-side Brillo boxes from Swedish private property, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their press panels were first founded and remelted, then white oil paint was applied with a brush.
The structure of the 1990 copies, on the other hand, betrays that the colour was applied directly to the press panel with a paint role without foundation - and it is not oil, but acrylic.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo-Boxes," says the director of the Moderna Museum, Lars Nittve, "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to another conclusion, the Moderna Museum will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
Already in July, the Authentication Board has freely announced to follow the "serious charges" raised in the matter of soap powder boxes.
But since then, you've been hiding there in unbelievably silence.
Rebellious soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers had given up who had broken into a hotel in Manila and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He couldn't answer for a blood transfusion, said the leader Antonio Trillanes, who accused president of corruption and electoral fraud, reporters at the hotel.
Government troops had previously stormed the hotel with tear gas.
The approximately two dozen soldiers had been in the building for hours.
Around half of them stood before the court on Thursday because of a failed potch test in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the negotiation to suddenly withdraw with about 30 sympathians.
The military police officers who were supposed to guard him were obviously overrun by him and joined his mother-in-law.
They entered the Pennsylvania hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops shut down the district around the leading hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who had previously commanded the elite unit of Scout Rangers, said that other military units wanted to join the march shortly.
Government critics had called for major demonstrations against the President for Friday.
Her government has been overestimating corruption for months.
Manila's financial district was already 2003 the main scene of the attempted execution of about 200 military members against Arroyo.
The rebellion failed to join the army after almost 24 hours.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.

First, the two companies want to satisfy themselves with a share of good ten percent of freenet and do not use their right to take over another 18.49 percent of freenet, United Internet shared on Thursday.
However, the two companies remained open to all options, in particular to further increase their participation in Freenet AG, it was said.
Discussions between the United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership were completed in mid-November.

Now it has been agreed that Drillisch will bring another about four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
