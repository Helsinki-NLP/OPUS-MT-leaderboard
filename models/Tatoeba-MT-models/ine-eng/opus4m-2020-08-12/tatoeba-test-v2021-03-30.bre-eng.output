I want to be a pnivist.
Stay at school.
Do you mind?
Are you all right?
They're all in the mother's room.
I'm staying here.
I've seen an earthquake in the zoo.
A thousand nights.
Do you want to go?
Look, a bee tree.
I want this thing, Tom.
I'm big enough.
And that's why he saw it.
He used to dress like a girl.
Are you all right?
I don't need any kind.
I lost my pen.
I haven't forgotten.
Where do you think Galleg is?
I want a guitar.
What are you doing?
I'll tell you what.
I know Tom well.
The list is available.
Are you here?
He was a slow girl.
It's dark.
My book is on your desk.
I'll tell you what you want.
It's private.
Tom didn't know Mary was capable of speaking French.
You!
Look, it's a tree.
He hasn't written the letter yet.
I'm out of the entire range of mail replies.
He was dying.
I like it.
It can't be.
This isn't a phrase.
I'll tell you what you want.
Can I just have a little bit of a wait?
They were naked.
Is it white?
You got a car?
A thousand friends.
You don't want Tom to go in his father's direction.
That's great.
Take you to Tatoeba!
Tom's talking.
You got a car?
Thank you.
I lost my phone.
There's a lot of fruit.
What is your address?
Who's got all the cookies?
Don't wait.
Do you like the blacksmith?
There was an error.
Don't talk to me!
Naf, it's not Persian.
He was poor.
They never make it.
They're in the press.
He was dressed like a woman.
Does it still matter?
Warning!
He's got a horse in his head.
I'm not one.
Don't leave me alone.
I wasn't.
My money was taken from me anyway.
A foreign-language university exists.
Take one of your prayers.
He was preaching to Tom.
You've had a lot of trouble under the spell.
God knows where to go.
Monday, March, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday is seven days a week.
Are you jealous?
I'm not leaving my head.
Please give me the pen.
More coffee, please.
He was the worst.
Thank you!
I mean, it was a lot of people in high school.
I'll give you a good chance.
"Tom's been in love with his favorite friend."
NAF, it's so funny.
But I don't need anything.
Good night!
Look, a Japanese tree!
I understand a wound.
Shut up.
I know what you're talking about.
Bennozh.
Please respond.
I'm telling you, Tom.
That's Tom.
I want you to see this girl.
Burj Khalifa is the world's tallest writer of today's world.
Are you going to get it?
I can't wait.
Do you give me the whole thing?
I've got some bad information.
Tom used to laugh.
There isn't any need for one.
I'm gonna get a job.
Get the fuck out of here.
Where is the chat room?
And Tom's meeting me?
I can't do that.
You like the Vagdalena doll.
This is my car.
I have to go.
This is enough on the table.
Look, it's an aberration tree.
We're not going to have any of them.
This is what you want.
They're still missing.
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
I'm afraid I'll kill your father.
Bennozh, Yukina.
It's not a string.
There's a lot of big words in Brazil.
The language is black.
Tell me about him.
He sang a song.
We're on it.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
The language is not white.
Look, a fig tree.
Dad wasn't home.
They're going out of their way.
Open around the north end of the car
You can't talk here.
I need a wing.
It's Tokyo.
You don't want Tom to be a loser like his father.
I'll be right there.
He's lost it again.
I've seen Tom.
He was a badass.
I've had a great time.
I like traveling.
You could've called the police and told them he wanted me to.
Just circuses.
People are going home.
I'll keep going.
I'd like you to have a guitar.
My router is filled with filter
Are you a coward?
Watch out!
I'm sure I've done something like that once in a while.
Look at a red bear.
I'm fine.
Solar images are repeated while I'm on my way.
It's the only thing that really happened.
Thank you very much.
Look, there's a tree in the corner.
What about you?
I'm gonna go talk to you before you get half done.
What are you talking about?
How much is that?
A strong ice is waiting.
I live in Japan.
I'm not special.
Naf!
When did you get it?
Tom's playing rugby.
Sunday's the last day of the week.
I'll hold on.
It's not my fault.
Look, there's a tree near you.
How many times is this timer?
The language is white.
I'm smart.
I've got some questions to ask you yet.
The friends do things together.
It wasn't my fault.
It's late.
I've seen him running.
It's Yen.
There was no contact between Mary and John.
I understand.
It's a cross.
I've been working on it for a while.
I love her.
He's playing Tom rugby.
Thank you very much.
I see something.
Tom's capable of making people do things for him.
Tom's good.
Tom used to be good.
That's what Debrit would do!
I'm better off.
I gotta get out of here.
Who's this guy?
Thank you.
Just white, please.
There was a smoke under the table.
It wasn't a good idea, was it?
Is he there?
You're all right.
Tom's gonna suffocate.
I want you to remember.
Tell me about him.
I don't like it.
I don't work.
I'm done.
This movie was both nice to Dom and Vari.
I don't speak Spanish.
If you're done with the whole thing, please give it to me.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Do you know who you are?
Yeah.
It's time to talk.
One's a bad guy. He's a bad guy.
He's got a brain in him.
I have to finish my duties
Did something wrong happen?
What are you guys doing?
I'm staying here.
Is there any way you can get the AIDS back to your private seats?
I want to get two things.
Where's the problem?
I'm afraid I'm lost.
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
You got the money?
I'm not gonna do that.
I'm not listening.
I've got it.
Is Tom here?
One language is not enough.
Have you ever been to Paris?
Tell me what you want.
I'm trying to.
I saw something.
Police call.
They're going crazy.
It's just games.
Tom didn't believe Mary when she said she loved him.
I've had a lot of trouble.
Tom's got names that don't understand Galician.
I don't speak Japanese.
You can hear me.
I know what you're like.
We're not going to have any of them.
Where's Galleg talk?
Theme is covered with a very wide cover for it
He's got a bitch.
I want to think about it.
It's almost like it's never going to happen.
Thank you, Yukina.
What about you?
It was last time.
Request for Paris.
I've come to work.
You'd better not go.
No error occurred.
I've had a lot of fun.
Thank you, brother.
Where's Gallagh?
He's here with me!
Are you sure?
I heard he's leaving.
I want to lose my phone.
No, it's so funny.
A beer, please!
You took everything.
Who's this guy?
We've got two guys.
Look, an akasia tree.
Do you have two computers?
I'm a kid.
The art is a bar.
I don't give a shit.
I'm sure you've seen it.
Do you speak Japanese?
I was trying to learn English.
Are you jealous?
I don't know.
This is not a big mistake.
This is not a big mistake.
I don't work.
Oh, my God.
I know what's good for Tom.
Have you ever been to Paris?
I didn't take any dough.
One of them is a worker.
NAF, what?
I didn't listen.
Are you kidding me?
How much does a bug cost?
I didn't lose.
Thank you!
I didn't take any strangulation.
I'm glad you're here.
Did you see a big hour?
It's not Tom's studio, it's one of the parents.
You're not going to go home the same way I used to.
Look, it's an adenium.
That's bad luck.
Look, a coincidence.
How long has this clock been set?
Be gentle with at least one aspect of it - it's a good idea to be a champion.
Can I have some coffee?
I've got a drop.
He was poor.
One's pockets look like a ludicrous stick.
Where's Gallagh talking?
There's a known language in every country.
The friend's doing things together.
Stay home.
I'd like to get in touch with the nebula.
I'd rather die than be Fadil.
I'm one of them.
NaF, it's so cool.
I'll take care of it.
That's not a phrase.
Evening!
The car's locked.
They had a song.
Look, it's a fairytale.
Thank you!
It's big and nice.
I can't wait.
She's reading it.
There are two pages.
Thank you, Yukina.
He was poor.
You're making a head in there.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
How about I meet Tom?
I've been thinking about this.
They're leaving.
There's still a cup of coffee, please.
I just got caught up with you.
Yeah.
No, thank you.
Is Tom here yet?
Tell me what you want.
I'm sure you told me.
I can see something.
This phrase is not French.
The car's blue.
One's a slave.
"What time is it?" "Half an hour."
They didn't run.
He was saving Tom.
I don't know.
I need an egg.
What are you playing with?
We're on our way.
He was a poor man.
Aonic's Tom.
How much is this meter?
I like it.
Do you like it?
Where'd he go?
There's a lot of noise.
I don't know.
They need friends.
Who's got all the cookies?
He was poor.
I'm going to school tonight.
Burj Khalifa is the world's tallest starboarder.
Tom and rabies.
Trying on-me.
Rugby's playing Tom.
I know you won't be told.
It's been a while.
It's hot today.
He was poor-black.
This table is too empty.
I thought Tom was dead.
Is Tom meeting me?
Let's go to Tatobe.
Thank you!
I'm gonna turn what I want!
It's poor-ass.
It's okay.
Look, a second tree.
I'll try again.
They're all in the mother's room.
Is there any way you can get the AIDS back to your private seats?
