What is going to happen? CSSD knew neither Voldemort nor pastry in Prague.
The new election of CSSD to the mayor of the capital will apparently have to overcome a real linguistic barrier to understand itself at the level of the municipal council with their former and new colleagues of the ODS.
The daily Actualne.cz "tested" the new members of the municipal council belonging to the CSSD, namely whether they knew the argument that was born in the last years at the mayor's office, when they were partners of the current coalition that led to Prague.
The coded vocabulary that Prague's political cream has set in motion during the previous age of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It is surprising that it has been discovered that the new electorate does not understand well the known terms.
At least they say it.
"Who's Valdemort."
"I really don't know."
"I am a young man in Prague's policy has responded to Lukas Kaucky, the choice of culture to test the vocabulary of the "parrain".
And with regard to the political veteran, Karel Brezina's election reacted in the same way.
For example, the sense of "golf hole."
"It's the only expression you're offering me to use."
Otherwise, I'm not using the argument.
From the vocabulary, of which the daily Newspaper.cz published the expressions in June of this year before the pre-sectoral Congress of the ODS, the editor chose 6 examples, in priority those related to the mayor of Prague.
The Socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", go to the pastry, "bovine nerve", "trahison of the capital" and "toll".
Three of the electors agreed for the Quiz, the fourth-Antonin Weinert, who has to lead education in Prague in the future - promised first of all an interview but then did not cancel the phone.
Petr Dolinek's fifth election firmly rejected the test.
"I don't care about all these things and how the representatives of civil democracy have fun: I won't give my opinion."
"I am currently dealing with the way we will understand ourselves in our programmes," he responded.
As we have already heard, the election of Lukas Kaucky did not appear to recognize in the above legend that it is the influence of Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of former Mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing aa'Kaucky and the only expression he has found in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucky and immediately adds, "But I know about the newspapers."
"I'm going to have to pay for a language course," he said.
Not only the killer Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the choice for the environment, know that the golf hole is the blank tunnel.
The two Social Democrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks of going to the pastry.
"It's, I think, going to a business," Plachy is ready to assume that it's the headquarters of Janousek companies.
At the same time, your Brezina remembers that he takes his knowledge of newspapers rather than of any vocabulary he would use.
According to test candidates, there is no lexical argument in social democracy.
"I've consulted with colleagues and it turns out we don't really have anything like this."
"Abbreviations and symbols are sometimes used," says Peter Hlinsky, president of the Socio-Democratic Party, who members of the Party call Hulda.
"My name was Briza at school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that way, so-called Karel Brezina about nicknames.
Actuel.cz has tested the name and it works.
The election of Weinert is Papy for the party members or the least friendly little old, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the election by the scrokers during the party's sponsorship, is referred to as "the little game".
Surnames are also the only ones who admit to using social democrats within the party.
It seems that Hulinsky doesn't like to hear much about Hulda, but the newspaper Akuel.cz has registered another nickname for this Prague president.
"Doctor in Law of the Matrix," he recalled, it seems that Petr Hulinsky obtained his doctoral title in Law of JUDr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "sorcières", published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women who are said to be witches have common traits.
They are part of the old generation, for example, they cannot work for health reasons, they are free and have no children.
The one that becomes "sorcière" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man rarely has this destiny."
"We do not judge young women in good health because they participate in work and care for children," says a sister in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special institution of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure".
He published a brochure that should help to limit hunting to witches.
The case has a "hic".
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso do not know how to read," warned Die Standard newspaper about the disadvantage of written education.
The charge of sorcery is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbor of Burkina Faso, Amy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and then burned with oil they had sprinkled.
This information was transmitted by the BBC server.
Criminals say it was a bad eye.
According to their version, the oil that serves the ritual ounces has been burned to the woman's contact.
The oil burned, apparently, when the team wanted to "fight the bad spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of the "storks" is approved by people at all levels of education.
The Der Standard daily quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying, "Human minds eaters have always been a danger," he said.
While Burkina Faso is trying to reduce the hunt for witches, the Gambia was not later than last year when the President saw himself participating.
"The Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide hunt for witches who, apparently, would have participated in his death and would have been tried by black magic to kill the President too."
"Course bells from Guinea have led to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police officers and the personal guard of the President, men and women selected by chance in the villages of the Gambia," said Amnesty International in a message.
On the farm, prisoners had to drink a plant-based potion to the hallucinogenic effects that added to other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners didn't survive.
On international pressure, about a thousand people were released.
The tenant of Bakal: The ponds are warm, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing old man came out from the RPG Byty's customer centre of the "carbon bar" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments to rent in the Czech Republic.
He carried under his arm a file with three new rental contracts for three apartments: his daughter, his daughter, and his son, who were serving a sentence.
Deregulation has increased the rent to these three people.
Instead of paying 3500, the son will have to settle from next year for a second category 2+1 apartment of 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and heating works on solid fuel," shows the finger on his son's new contract the man who has the signing power.
"But I signed anyway," he explains, "for reasons of anger and half resigned.
The BytyOKD.cz Association, which described the new conditions of rental as "immoral and indecent", advises tenants not to sign and wait until 7 December, when a notice will be published to explain the method to be followed to claim.
But man reacts to it by a gesture of his hand.
"One saying it, the other saying it" in the face of the thorns.
The Ostrava region becomes the deregulation laboratory.
After the New Year, this is what most apartments in the Czech Republic expect, whose rents do not correspond to the market price.
Currente.cz has therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" on its own.
The waiting room of RPG in Havirovska Street is one of the four in the Ostrava region and is already full on Tuesday at 09 a.m.
Right next to the door is a security company guard with a device to call customers.
A special button, "loyer 2011", is lit on the touch screen.
One pressure and one paper with a number out of the device.
You don't have time to read your "157" number that your number is already starting to light up on the large screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second it's your turn.
After a short while, an old couple arrives to find out about the rental, but the new rentals do not seem to concern people in the waiting room.
Most people have come to solve common problems like everywhere - demand for repairs, insurance events and so on.
In the Ostrava region, more than 44,000 RPG portfolio apartments receive mail with new leases in their letter box since about mid-November.
RPG Byty offers an increase in rent from 15 to 38 percent.
the special door for new rentals has been open to the public since 18 November.
"It has been working for almost a week, so it is still the test" responds, after a moment of hesitation, to the employee behind the door when the customer presents himself as a journalist.
The deragulation and former minor apartments of Bakal are a very sensitive local topic.
The Vice-President of Parliament and of the region of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of the Socialists has made this clear in a sufficiently sustained way before the elections and is now filling in the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change a well...in a board in the toilets, the man mentioned in the introduction is relieved.
However, it is especially for employees to receive pensions that come to be sure that they will receive a return on the new rental price if they sign now as promised by the RPG in a special offer.
This is a half-retirement of the rent that will be received by the other tenants who will have signed their new contract before 15 December.
But the "deregulation" door of the Havirovaska Street is really not finished by questions.
"Among the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came to rent it," says the employee at the door.
And yet RPG poses both on its website and in individual rental entertainment windows when necessary.
If both parties do not agree on the rent, an independent court will take the decision.
'This is not a threat, but only to inform on the only and legitimate way to act legally', says RPG on its website.
"No one here will be in court" thinks one of RPG Byty's employees and the man on the street in front of the client center gives him reason.
"I have 13000 retirement crowns and I have 5,000 crowns left to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he says.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and so people wait," she said.
Rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, moreover, current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, who is precisely the neglect of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in the rent.
However, in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest in 4 billion apartments with rents, in four years 2011 to 2014, this should be 5.2 billion.
The large screen anchored to the ceiling in front of the covered chairs of the Havirosvka Street waiting room, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
'The increase in rent in 2011 is 15 per cent and is not less than 31200 apartments or more than 90 per cent of RPG apartments'.
"And that will always be up to 7.50 Czech crowns per month," says the screen.
The 38 percent increase is only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, this is an increase in a very low sum of 19.66 Czech crowns to m2," adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but progressive increase in 4-8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the increase in rents (see the graph) is made to apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on the increase in rent have priority.
The maternal school is also part of offices that include architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint de Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch. Design.
No one could have expected that he would also cover a mini-school with everything he needed - color walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October last year, you can go to Arch. design employees' children.
Arch. Design. whose workshops have produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has imagined its mini-maternal business school since the first construction of the Avriopoint building.
It employs approximately 90 people, especially children's age, and it was important for women architects and project managers to be able to return to work quickly.
At the same time as low-time employment contracts, the primary school is a bonus offered to its employees by Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Manufacturers and architects thus have the opportunity to alleviate work with childcare.
They are the employees of Arch.Design.they themselves who imagined this mother school and with the support of the management they were able to obtain a staff from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The primary school is funded by the European Social Fund through the Operational Human Resources Programme and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
With funding appropriations (up to 2.8 billion Czech crowns), they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and, after two years, to provide qualified staff and road transport.
After the use of the funding staff (two years) Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to have the primary school operate on its own funds.
The project's preparation lasted a year and it was the Economy rating company that helped make the application.
Childcare is provided by a qualified staff, a nurse and a maternal teacher take care of children all day long. Children can go to the maternal school without a limited age but they have more than three reasons for most.
As it is a "mini-mother's school", there can only be 5 children present at the same time, but there are more children who replace each other during the day.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and children of all employees have the same right to use this school regardless of the position.
Although it is an individual care and education, the program of the primary school is comparable to that of pre-school education.
Children only play but quality education is also ensured - from the beginning to the preparation of school banks we teach English.
The class is equipped not only with toys and imaginative games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can control their child at any time and do not have the stress of a delay to go looking for children in a school away from their parents' workplace.
Parents therefore use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that there is a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.s is thus registered among companies that offer a choice bonus for recruiting new employees and are friendly to the family and through this program enhances the marketing of HRs.
The ossuary house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look inside Gaudi.
The roof is similar to the back of a prehistoric sauna, the staircase to a spine of dinosaurs and the balconies to open fish gills.
This is the house Casa Battlo in Barcelona by architect Antoni Gaudi.
Due to its organic forms, the house received the nickname of Maison in bone from the premises.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaics, facade recalling stairs and all over the curves, this is what is special for the New Art of Antoni Gaudi.
The front face of the house takes place its dream lines, its nice colors and textures that remind nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation, we can see geometry, rhythm and order thought precisely.
In the night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of the brightness of the colors is strengthened.
The rolling and twisting of shapes also appears in the interior with the same measure.
The wood in waves copies the window frames, the balustrades, the decorative elements of the doors, the eyelids and the blades.
The house Battlo, which stands in the Eixample district in the shopping street Passeig de Gracia to number 43, was born of the construction of a house of 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a rich entrepreneur, first insisted on demolishing the old construction and construction of another new one, but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and better market reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-housed house was not thought by Gaudi alone.
The architect Joseph Maria Jujol worked with him.
It was precisely on his project that decorations were made for an apartment representing the owner of the building and the use of the mosaic for the facade.
Other artists and creators also worked for the facade.
The joint work for the Casa Battlo house plans began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and of the Guell Park where there are other works of Gaudi.
The premises have named the hot house just after its completion due to its organic forms "the house in the bone".
Others, considering the specific window opening mechanism, called it "the house that dances".
It is said that above the construction there is a sword similar to that of Saint Georges the patron of the Catalogue.
Other elements of construction sculpture contain hidden religious motives.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time, with air events and typical fireplaces.
Their 45 degree inclination seems strange.
During the creation of Gaudi did not comply with the construction directives at the time and was not allowed to interfere with them.
At the beginning of the construction, he obtained permission from the city to build, knowing, of course, that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years after the completion, the municipal council was horrified and asked for changes.
He was not pleased, for example, with the members of the municipal council that the construction pillars imposed on the public road.
There was never a change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city of Josep Battlo requested (and obtained satisfaction) the permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and a private room and part of the apartment.
The floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The whole six-storey house is shared by a staircase through which you can access up to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of reconstruction and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi also works on the modern concept of connection of spaces.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the halls and the high society can communicate comfortably or be limited to private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi also received new facades a non-traditional roof and two additional floors.
Gaudi's game with light is also impressive, blue and white glass tiles with which the inner court is decorated and with light wells.
The two-colour game gives maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was simply enough to bet on the principle that white reflects more than the shadow that, on the contrary, absorbs the rays of the sun.
The Casa Battlo house that was registered in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund may have been visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and most beautiful apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued their visits because they found it to be a profitable business and extended the scope of the visits to common spaces and to the border, including roof terraces.
The ticket to the monument is not really expensive and costs 16.50 euros; students, retirees, groups and card holders have 20 percent discounts.
The sum is still above the entry price in Gaudi's other buildings in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic tours, you must quickly find a friend among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a dream: women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatious framework, but rather the quality of the area reserved for bed, so mattresses and sommere provide a real basis for a good bed.
They must, of course, complement themselves harmoniously to please a specific user.
During the choice several things are decisive: weight, size, age, health status and the owner's sex.
The type of interior in which the mattress is to be placed and the dream is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where latex mattresses are not constantly slept out, they are not suitable because they are "heated" gently.
They have, above all, a higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilating channels in the heart and if they remain on a solid board, they retain moisture. From the moisture can also form.
The habit is also decisive in the choice.
Anyone who passes the light from time to time abroad where we often use very thick mattresses with a fold-up layer will find it difficult to feel well on a low and hard surface.
"That's how all the hockeyists who come back from NHL complain that they can't sleep there."
"For their tired shoulders, their feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a fold-up layer of mossy moss."
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people who suffer from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder that therefore takes poor "information" of joints and skin," explains Sylva Adamkzykova, who specializes in restored furniture.
That's why a few years ago the mattress with the pesky mousse conquered hockeyists and other customers.
"Today everything goes well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico have suitable mattresses.
You don't need to be a NHL guy to be able to appreciate a pessimistic mousse.
This "miracle" just works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the absorbed heat or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing pressures you and you won't come back in the night like after a hard game.
You're just sleeping better.
The mussel also functions as a protection against the squares.
For the selection of the mattress depending on your size, add the length of the feet, or about 21/34 cm.
A man and woman of a size of 180cm therefore need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each double bed should be 90 cm or 180 cm.
For single beds, single beds, for example, are recommended to take at least 120 - 140 cm.
It's comfortable in case of a visit.
'However, it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on your back you should put your hands in a comfortable way with the slightly folded shoulders. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Boureliers-Mathelasiers and Decorators, who has been devoted for several years to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and teaching it in specialized schools.
For a double bed each needs its own hat and mattresses, however, during the purchase of good choice of the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will only be left to climb the roof at different heights and this is not feasible on all bed frames.
Mousse mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, spring mattresses at least 15 cm, which is counted for the shape and air layer at least three centimeters.
"To touch or in position sits on the mattress you must not feel the springs," says Héléna Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a well-defined type of dream.
The bed-bed, when the mattress and the bed-bed are united as Siamois sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms to sleep.
The mattresses were very bad; we should not wash it, which is usually done at this time.
And since during the night sweats normally from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins to remember a large (and dense) tamis.
For this purpose, experts refuse to make a claim for a life of 25 years for a materiel or life insurance.
But it's all hers.
And for this an experience advice on the part of the sellers: for a 120/140cm mattress, give up, for the covering of the mattress, to the hygiene or to the washing, but instead add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even though it is common today to make coatings with sliding closure for the whole, that is to say, after opening we have two parts (for washing and washing machine size is very important!) otherwise the manipulation for large models (and for one person) becomes when we remove them from a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a rigid board in your bed instead of a dreamer?
Never!
Maximum for one bed for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board (if there is no) with air hole and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with sachet springs (from Germany Taschenfederken) and an air layer.
A polyurethane mattress should not be part of such a bed.
For single position blades with 14/18 blades, latex mattresses or sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut nuts) are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more blades, 28 and above, where the blades are doubled in the bottom of the kidneys and thus it is possible to regulate rigidity.
For multi-position mattresses, there is no need to take spring mattresses because it does not respond to position changes.
In addition to the rigidity adjustment of the blades, what is called a shoulder strap can also be installed.
This is a special connection of the blades that allows pressure to either tilt the blade so that the shoulder of the sleeper "integres" well.
For men who have "the shoulders as wide as the back", this is really important.
This is already considered by the matrices manufacturers who for the "males" have started to use a fold-up area at the level of the shoulders.
But they also think about women — they offer them a softer surface at the hips.
For the most difficult client there are dreamers to wings or posters with what is called a multi-force suspension.
Pressure decreases in more points and reduces tension.
But of course, attention, as soon as you use a bad earring (large and inflated air) on good mattresses and sommere, the "plus" disappeared.
The basic rule is a simple earring: the ear should support the head and its points should reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinavians by example prefer.
When lying on the side, the ear should level (with the shoulder strap of the hat or the waist area in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first grass and straw.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also in the bio-materials.
Oil-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is manufactured, are replaced by natural oils such as soybean oil.
Almost all known manufacturers just use soybean.
"The Bio qualification for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products," explains Petr vasicek of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for the coatings of the mattresses; one of the first was the vera aloe.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop forest or lavender scents.
There are differences between men and women.
While the extract of ball plants to absorb the heat and cool the body, "frozen" the man, the coatings "heat" the women.
Red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for low sex.
Current favorites?
The mattresses made from cold mousse (it has more pores with a cellular structure disrupted therefore more breathable than standard polyurethane and more elasticity.
The combination of various rigidities of cold mussels gives polyzone mattresses that know exactly where the head, bottom and feet are.
You pay a quality mattress from 7000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as health instruments.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex reached its first place.
Saving for mattresses and sommere is not easy.
There may occasionally be two mattresses for a single price as part of special actions by manufacturers or producers.
For example, the Magniflex company that offers Duofreeze mattresses with the memory mousse covered with 190 crowns.
Of course we can take the second free.
The age of parsley or viscoelastic mussels with an open cell structure and a large thickness was started with the Tempur material at a "cosmic" rhythm.
This started as a matter for NASA because the astronauts were subjected to the start of huge load factors.
The Tempur melts to the heat and hardens, on the contrary, to the cold.
It therefore perfectly adapts to the warm human body and distributes it with optimal pressure.
It is ideal for this against bad sleep and for increased comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic mussels are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special pillows for feet that relax the legs and the poisonous system.
Czech manufacturers use, for example, the EucathermC or Twinsaver or the same type.
Devices to monitor people are increasingly being asked by parents who want to monitor their children.
The fear of their children has led more and more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars, can also be used to track the movement of people and help in some cases, such as the one of the little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is now as large as a box of lamps but will soon be of the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka has emanated a large number of people and they have begun to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their private lives.
"We are trying to tell everyone that it is not espionage but only another way to reduce the likelihood that there is another tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, who is one of the suppliers of tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I realize that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting them in the bag of a person who is not aware of it, but I have not yet met such cases."
"Most people are customers who actually buy the product for security reasons," added Pilin.
According to him, children should always know for what purposes "the box" is used and how to use it in case of emergency.
Children's psychologist Dana Bockova draws attention to the fact that if the child does not want to wear such a thing, he will get rid of it.
'And even the smallest ones can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something explicitly when they don't want to be under control.'
"The mobile phones, which can cut themselves like these tracking devices, have already brought their parents to long expectations," Bockova says.
According to her, the fact that this type of device can help in the event of aggression is highly controversial.
"If this is a prepared kidnapping, the author will do everything to ensure that the child does not have an electronic device that can locate it."
"Currently, it's the phone."
"As soon as the tracking devices develop, they (criminals) will also search for them because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
"In such cases, criminals will always be on the police," says the psychologist.
She agrees, however, that such devices can help when an attack is not prepared by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, says that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the event of an aggression.
"The apparatus may be so measured as to be in regular emission after a specified period."
"In the case where the device is destroyed, it remains the last position of the person concerned."
'The most expensive devices also have a flashlight that immediately signals the position of the person who slipped and is in a position that is extended without moving,' says Cech.
According to him, smartphones that are so intelligent that they are equipped with a navigation system can offer a comparable service after they have formatted it with a special prological.
The problem with the current tracking systems is that it is a device similar to that which is carried depending on the size of a lamp box or the smallest telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Macro Weil's Pilina, that's why tests are being carried out to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the potential attacker will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Or he'll realize after a while, which will give the police a little more time," he adds.
Whether the tracking device is developed as a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as to track cars.
This is a combination of the acquisition systems of a position using the GPS (which is commonly used in self-navigation) and a function of a mobile phone that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating wires that it could take the Czech Republic round with it, but it can only hold two years.
The army bought 445 km of wires used for explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defence had bought 224 km.
The army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life span of the cables is up to two to four years.
The army bought detonating wires to the anonymous company STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The major general state has given rise to the purchase of a huge amount of detonating wires to MF DNA that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reserve calculations made by military pyrotechnics, which MF DNAs contacted, it is clear that even generals, officers with command, secretaries or household personnel should have an explosive exercise every year.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, military commander, are no exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the army of 60 km of detonating wires.
This distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were true, the army's reserves could be subpoenaed for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals, it would be sufficient for more than 2 m of detonating wires, as the experts say, that means that the army with its new purchase has ensured, with also the consumption of special units and engineering, reserves for the said 225 years.
However, the soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they had almost no ammunition for their guns and that shooting sessions were limited due to cash needs.
We don't talk about the lack of body clothing.
"And I don't mind if they buy us so many detonating wires."
"And that's their decision and they really know what they're doing."
"for us the army is a good client that we strive as traders to content," says the commercial director of STV Group Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence, argues that hundreds of miles of detonating wires will be purchased by the army in reserve for 10 years.
However, Jan Decky of STV Group reports only four years of life of detonating wires and police and military pyrotechnicians for only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the warehouses, it may even go up to four years," says one who does not want his name to be published in the light of the military's criticism.
The life span of each ammunition must be tested to see whether it remains integral and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The other argument of the Department is a discount due to the amount of 445 km of cordial detonators.
"They cost us 60 percent less than the last year's delivery of 245 km," says Pejsek's spokesman, who interprets the opinion of the Department of Defence's buyers.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of detonating wires by police pyrotechnicians who neutralize the ammunition of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army does not exceed 1500 metres.
And the police still only order the amount of ammunition needed to be used before the end of their life.
This has been developed for safety reasons for pyrotechnicians and to be able to obtain more flexible types of more modern and reliable detonant cables.
The Ministry of Defence today has major problems for the neutralization of tens of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the strong Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move, headed for the Rhine.
What lies ahead in a few years is this Czech army that MF DNA has contacted: neutralizing hundreds of kilometres of old detonating wires that it buys today "at a good market".
So far, I have benefited from contacts that I have obtained through the competitions.
The free sale of his hotel helped Lukas Pytloun to win the best individual Entrepreneur.
The winner of the competition of the best individual Entrepreneur for last year was Lukas Pytloun, 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure towards success is like in a movie.
Luke Pytlon likes to travel.
And abroad, it became clear that in Liberia there was a lack of a quality accommodation site at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned while working abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he bought a small building of 5 flats half demolished.
Knowing that he was still studying in the third year of higher education, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between the quality and the price of a hostel in our region has given me a desire to do something," says Lucas Pytloun.
He started renting the first renovated apartment to foreign workers.
It reinvests the benefit in the building that it converts into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, his company's action has allowed him to open 4 beds in Libérec, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of almost 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four Pytloun hotel design stars.
This year, he had another similar quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our concept of franchise and other candidates for the franchise of Pytloun hotels," the number 1 of entrepreneurs last year.
"And for the sale of the license for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory in the competition of the contractor of the year has served well, Pytloun adds with appreciation.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known in Liberia and its surroundings.
"People recognized me in the streets, often congratulated me, and, I have to say, it was very nice," he recalls.
It recommends participation in this competition to all those who are trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win, but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he is still using his contacts and knowledge that he could not have obtained in another way.
"With those I met through the competition, I started to maintain business relations regularly.
According to him, success-related reputation has also had an impact on employees.
And he's about 70.
"I note, in particular, the loyalty and pride of being committed to something that has been generally recognized."
"It is not, and far away, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
"Only my name is put forward," says Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than the one we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of victory has been rapidly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the goal of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind him.
The one who came looking for the prize in Slovansky dum for the first place of the competition for the firm of the year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of Farmet.
The board has rewarded the efforts with which it has transformed a tool workshop to Ceska Skalice into a business firm of 100 million crowns.
'I can say that the reward has not only encouraged me and my collaborators and has increased our confidence in ourselves to fight competition', says today the winner of the competition last year.
At the beginning of Farmet's history there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state offered Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of the goods by the communists, he did not hesitate long, refused a career in a company where he worked at the time, and created a company with a few friends around his father for the manufacture of plastic baths.
Not long after they started specializing in the vegetable oil press.
He became the largest automatic press manufacturer in Central Europe after eighteen years.
The company was even known in the unspecialized public after the success of the competition through the media.
"Not only have our customers started to really get to know the Farm brand, but also the foreign partners who started to realize that they were working with a company that had achieved the greatest success in its country of origin," says Karel Zdarsky.
But last year it did not happen to Farm only in the euphoria of victory.
The evaluation of the company was made from 2008 and in part 2009.
And just in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the top of the crisis, which has not really affected citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and start to limit their purchases of new equipment and technologies.
"We have obviously not escaped this situation."
"Business figures fell by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even license," explains Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that from time to time, unpopular measures must be taken.
But they managed the situation correctly and preserved beneficial results even if they were less than they had before the crisis.
However, in Farm, they continued without commitment to invest in research and development.
"We have built a training and research centre with the resources, strengthened the presentation of society in international exhibitions and won the main rewards in national exhibitions," Zdarsky says.
Everything makes us think that the crisis is behind them.
Business figures also increase the number of employees with them.
"To a new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that removes foolish regulations.
The investigation into the absurdity of the year is for the fourth time part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations could have been deleted.
The little glamorous winner of this year's investigation into the absurdity of the year was the obligation to provide in the offices of documents that officials can obtain online.
More than a third of the 4,000 voters voted in favour.
For example, the social affairs administration asked for a paper extract from the trade register, while the official could obtain it in two clicks of mouse.
it changes through the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer request the extract of the trade register for insurance payments controls," said Jana Buranova, spokesman of the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
To highlight all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must comply with in the Czech Republic and to eliminate those who are absurd is the sense of this year's absurdity contest.
This survey is still this year for the fourth time part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske novitany and has even greater popularity.
If the last year 3,000 voters have manifested themselves, at least 4000 this year have given their vote.
And it is not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that only hinder the company, and, more and more.
"We may be the number of documents to be completed for tax returns at the top of the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of enterprise activity has become a declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the whole world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is at 74th place in terms of the conditions for the company, or 8 more places than last year.
The absurdity contest of the year was first established in 2006 and continues each year according to the same scenario.
Any who can report on the administrative and bureaucratic absurdities of April to the end of September, the last time before the end of the competition.
To report there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. The contest organizer then selects seven candidates for the "antiprix" and allows the public to vote during October at www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and at www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that has received the greatest number of votes is declared winner.
Until last year's survey, it is one hundred, or more precisely 105 regulations and decisions that have lost their sense of existence.
The comments are sent by entrepreneurs but also by professional associations and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, so among the nominees are the obligation that highways and fast-track maintenance vehicles pay the pay, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees repeat two offices and two toilets every two years.
the list of seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the competition, which always begins in early November on Place Venceslas in Prague, is part of an event that regularly participates in political and public life personalities.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association for Small and Medium Enterprises of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kuzel, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended at the time of the competition.
'Economic prosperity cannot function when the state puts âttons in the feet of entrepreneurs and for this reason my aim is to remove, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate the company,' said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
Efforts to eliminate absurd decisions are not a sword in the water.
In 2007, what people did not like was the obligation for entrepreneurs to report three days before the individual company office to the place where the company was located, the intention to go to an exhibition or pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was deleted with the amendment of the Individual Enterprise Act.
The second most controversial obligation in 2007, which was to report to the Labour Office a service trip for a foreign employee in 30 days, was deleted with the text of the Act on what is called the green map.
And everything is fine until the third session of the competition.
The absurdity of the year 2009 was decided for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This has been changed by order of the Department of Health last year the obligation to have a refrigerator has been removed.
A new category rewards the companies responsible socially.
Environmental, humanitarian, training or sports projects are evaluated.
This year's novelty of the Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has been in existence for 5 years, is the category called the Company Responsible for 2010.
The objective of this competition is to support the reasonable and fair company.
"We want to support companies that monitor the impact of their business on the environment and conduct a socially responsible activity," says Patrick Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile phone operator, Vodaphone, who is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the competition for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this sub-category of the 2010 firm competition, organised by Vodaphone, companies that did not succeed with a single long-term goal for the company were registered.
The adventure of each of them is inspired and an independent article would be to be edited.
Although their business is different from each other, their support and predictive activity can be considered as the denominator of their efforts.
For one case, this applies to persons with disabilities and to the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the fourteen finalists for the whole Czech Republic is not the Prague Prological Society and Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams for their employees who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports disciplines.
Another example of firm responsibility in the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main contributor to the staffing fund for 17 years that sponsors children with disabilities.
In caring for employees with health problems, the old Podebrad paper factory, which employs more than 70 per cent, has also become the company responsible for the Central Bohéme region and has become a third in the region in the contest of the firm of the year organized by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company, which has won for introducing spare hours and even reduced up to 35 hours per week on average and, without, proportionally, wage reduction.
The board also devolves the title because it primarily buys Czech manufacturers, supports a ditoy activity in the nearby environment and is concerned about the environment.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business activity and our administration have the least impact on the environment," explains Miluse Ryzanrova, the executive director of society.
the responsible IT company Log in from the Usti Region also thinks about the health of its employees and has installed an ergonomic chair and keyboard for each mobile computer, encourages their work at home and uses catering services from a local protected plant for its actions.
"We also support the Foundation The man in the shadow that helps the local Roma community," said Ondrej Suchy, the representative of society.
In the latter category is also a laundry and cleaning company in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the pension insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transportation, increased qualifications and recreation," says Joseph Strapac of the company building bruntal Czasch, the winner of the Moravia-Silesia region.
All the regional finalists for the Vodaphone Year firm were automatically included in the responsible company category, who had answered the questionnaires in the attached part of the registration document and sent it to the organizer before 15 August.
The incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were removed from the competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the companies in high school had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the Responsible firm but were not disqualified from the "main" competition of the firm of the Year of Vodaphone."
"Independent registrations are not possible because this is a subcategory of the main competition of the firm of the year," explains Karel Goldman of Bison&Rose's organization agency.
In the Land Fund in Plzen, police arrested during a public competition
In the Land Fund building in Plzen, the anti-corruption police have been arrested in recent days.
The detectives passed the menots to the local contractor and trading in Lubos. G.
He had endeavoured to manipulate just a public tender for the settlement of an application for a refund in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a specific candidate.
He was supposed to pay a half million crowns to Lubos G..
"For the moment, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person for a crime of initiation in the context of a call for tenders and a public competition." said the chief of the Plzen Parquet, Plzen Antonie Zelena, who knows that it is forbidden to provide more explanations because the investigation is underway.
Policemen released this 46-year-old entrepreneur after 24 hours.
In order to know how it could influence a public competition, we can only speculate about so little official information.
On a question of Pravo, the spokesperson for the Lubomira Cerna Land Fund indicated that police officers had actually been arrested in Plzen on a separate workplace and that during the public competition.
"He was a client and in no case an employee, she specified.
The public competition according to Cerna has as its real name "Call for rights to land transfer under the Land Act" and is put in place when a number of beneficiaries of law manifest themselves.
"These persons propose, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their right to restitution which must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
"According to the proposed rights, a classification of buyers is established and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," explained the Fund's spokesperson.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, information about the persons who had entered the appeal and, as he himself is, a beneficiary because having purchased a large number of refund rights, he had proposed to the candidates in the field not to participate in the competition.
And he was no doubt in the process of retreating.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his interpelation.
Lubos G. had extensive contacts above the standards at the FdT (Lands of Lands).
He was in the case of FdT former head of the FdT Vaclav Sankot who was prosecuted for editing lands for which the construction decision had already been edited.
Lubos G. had just obtained, for example, land for the construction of public communications, specifically in the place where access to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the mayor for a building in the historic centre of the city whose value is far higher.
The mayor was obliged to accept because otherwise she could put the construction at risk by blocking the land.
Households will pay a supplement of a hundred crowns per month for the accommodation.
From January onwards, households will have to pay a supplement not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rentals will also increase.
So from January onwards, families will have to draw from their wallet up to a hundred crowns monthly more than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, gas by almost 2 percent cheaper, in some places you will have to pay up to a tenth more water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity should be based on the 100 crowns per year for households in the apartment more than currently.
However, all suppliers have reduced electricity prices given the development that is sensitive to encouraging the production of renewable energy, including photovoltaic batteries.
Gas increases moderately but of course when people need it most to warm up and therefore have the greatest consumption.
So we can also count a hundred additional crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, changing the price of central heating differs from city to city.
These are mainly the biggest commons that plan price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for the central heating almost 50 crowns more per month, the Liberian families will pay more than 1000 crowns annually.
For the people of Prague, an increase of 9 per cent for water and sanitation is being prepared in case the city increases infrastructure rentals.
If the rents do not change the thresholds, they will pay an additional 6.8 per cent.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest in comparison with the country as a whole.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation increase by 7.4 per cent.
For example, rental prices will increase significantly in the 450 thousand rental apartments from January to the end of the regulation.
For example, CPI Byty, which has nearly 2,500 apartments in Usti nad Labem, has decided to increase up to 100 percent.
Those who do not agree with the new increase in rents will be brought before the courts by society.
Regular rents paid by people in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase by 10% next year.
The Czech children swim at the rum and farnet. The beer is no longer fashionable and acts mildly.
Fernet, rum, vodka and in an exceptional way also the best brand of whiskey are stolen to parents.
These are drinks that most often bring those who heal, who are not yet fifteen years old, between the hands of the doctor.
Children who are cared for at the hospital for relapse do not make an exception.
This is the result of the experience of doctors who experience cases similar to hospital admissions.
"Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to be healthy."
'The trend is really strong', says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of the Children's Department of Horovice Hospital in Central Bohemia.
"When they can chip a bottle of papa in the closet, it's sometimes whisky, but it's the fern and vodka that prevail."
"The vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and don't feel it," explains the Department Chief.
Eva Jurinova, spokesperson for the Motol Hospital, also gives her reason.
"In general, it's rum or fernet."
"It's alcohol today, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was slivevice that they brought home," Jurinova added.
According to the Head of Pélikan Department, seeing children aged 13 to 14 years of age at hospital admission is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he spent ten years in pediatrics where the ambulances brought out students from a wide area completely Ivorian.
"A young girl was hospitalized four times
"She started her 12-year career when she was brought with 3.5 for a thousand alcohol in the blood with an extra mix with ecstasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at the Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party."
"What's interesting is that it doesn't seem strange to the mother that her daughter is missing for 48 hours," says the Department Director.
It is precisely the disinterest of parents or their tolerance outside the common face of their rejection of alcohol that is the main cause of the development of child alcoholism.
According to experts, however, there is no mention of dependence, in its strict sense, on children.
"There is a chronic dependence on alcohol on alcohol for several years with all the phenomena that result from it but that it is not found in children."
"For those who use alcohol repeatedly, it is rather a significantly unfavourable socio-family background," explained the Head of Pélikan Department.
According to the Jurinova spokesperson, about forty Ivre children were hospitalized this year until mid-November at the pediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases of severe poisoning requiring hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Ivorian children who are after emergency care brought home by their parents or by the police are not counted.
In addition to children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, Pélikan boasts three seasonal waves with which you can count: the day of the witches, the holy Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"Whether they drink suddenly after bad results or on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of vacations."
"Of course I lived on the day of the surgeons an admission of 7 Ivres children at once," Pélikan said.
The child who spent the night at the hospital in detoxification under medical control is paradoxically in a better position than the one who came home and suffered the next day from the "wood mouth".
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
"They are better lotus for this because they spend an excellent evening and then a gentle awakening and nothing hurts them."
"They are only surprised at where they are," adds Pélikan, knowing from time to time that this causes the good mood of the patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
Transportation by ambulance and hospitalization on the bed of intensive care can go up to tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time, I have applied this as a means of education, counting on how much it cost these children and that they could spend all summer working seasonally to repay one evening," Pélikan added.
However, according to him, health insurance companies in their retirement management, which should be able to recover from parents the care-related burdens, do not deal with cases of illiteracy.
Two L-159 planes are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two L-159 of the five, against which the Ministry of Defence exchanged aircraft for Casa C-295M, took off for Seville in Spain on Tuesday, where the Casa-EADS aircraft manufacturer is located.
This is the first time that devices of this kind become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
However, they have been abroad in the course of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are double versions of the L-159T1 that have so far been in service in the Czech army and were in flight.
The remaining devices are single versions of the L-159.
They are currently stationed at Aero Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the company Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Department of Defence's Press Department, Vodochody's physical departure is currently unknown.
'The L-159 aircraft intended for exchange have been taken on long-term stored aircraft without causing additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence.'
"The L-159 T1 biplaces have been exchanged in the state," said Pravo Pejsek.
He said that the army would not be left without a biplace, as in May 2009 the Department signed an agreement with Aero Vodochody with a value of 200 million crowns for the transformation of four L-159 monoplaces that were not used in two biplaces.
The army took delivery of the first apparatus in July, the second being scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS, it has undertaken to introduce aircraft into the equipment of certain Alliance countries.
"The contract clearly states that the one taking the L-159 aircraft into account is EADS and that they will serve to train NATO pilots."
"It is therefore the case of the one taking into account how to achieve this," said Pejsek.
Hospodarske noviny announced, some time ago, that the Spanish army was not interested in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was buried last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Department of Defence has not launched a call for tenders and has contacted EADS directly.
the defence management argued while the exchange ensured a future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 appliances in Aero Vodochody and only used 24 devices, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft will probably have judicial implications.
However, the European Commission complained against the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been selected as part of a European call for tenders and in no case by directly contacting a manufacturer.
The army has already delivered three Casa aircraft, the last one should arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the yearbook is a low risk sign of cancer
Men who have a longer index than the pendulum are exposed to less risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of hormone male testosterone.
"Our conclusions show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men 60 years ago," said the co-author of the Ros Eeles study, Professor of Cancer Research at Warwick University.
The finger could thus help determine who men should be tested for prostate cancer, including by combining genetic risk or other aggravating factors such as family health history, Eelas added.
During the 1994-2009 period, she followed more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and nearly three thousand healthy men with her colleagues in Britain.
More than half of the participants in the study had the right-hand index shorter than the cancellation.
For them as for 19 percent of those who had their fingers the same length, the same probability of prostate cancer was found.
In the case of those who had the longer index than the cancellation, however, the risk fell to 33 per cent, for men before 60 years the risk reduction reached 87 per cent.
The length of the two fingers listed - formed during the prenatal period - indicates, among other things, different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Unless testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies showed that it is precisely testosterone that helps develop prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK that he is aware of this study but does not seem to him that the relationship between finger length and cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is snowed, the motorways D1 and D5 are closed.
Czech Republic as most of Europe is this morning covered by snow.
On the roads and roads, there is most of the time of the compact snow, the weathermen have worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and the 93th kilometers towards Rozvadov due to several accidents of trucks and cars and the D1 motorway in Brno towards Prague.
The driver of the Central Automotive Club (UAMK) told the information
At the 91st kilometer a truck was hit, at the 93rd two heavy weights hit, the accident caused injuries.
Several cars also found themselves in the hole.
The problems are also on the motorway D1 to 185 km towards Prague.
Two trucks hit.
Drivers should leave just after Brno at 190 km or go to Brno and then enter at 182 km in Kyvalka.
A row of cars several kilometers has formed in this place.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and, this, just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a snow layer of several centimeters thick, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
For example, rows of cars are created in Prosek, Sterboholska Street is also closed.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
For example, the tramways are delayed on the line between Place Charles (Karlove Namesti) and Place of Peace (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning the major state of the Prague crisis has yet to meet.
Railways and airports also face problems.
The Czech Railways have already had to be removed due to snow 7 fast links.
Lines such as Prague in Kralupy or Prague in Beroun have problems
Travelers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyna airport has been closed since Wednesday 11 a.m. at night until 5 a.m.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already rolling but rewinding.
On the road of Vyskov, three side roads are impracticable, on the road of Brno it begins to have snowflakes and on the road of Blanco chains are mandatory to pass certain communication paths in the places above.
The Vyskov region has been among the most affected areas.
So far, the axes are closed: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
In order to clean them, it may be necessary to send snowflakes and snowflakes.
We can't estimate for the moment when they'll be rolling.
On the road of Hodonin, caution is strict in the White Carpathians region.
On the roads that are, in terms of nature protection, maintained only by the spraying of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimeters of snow warned CTK.
In the Czech Republic, it fell between two and 10 centimeters of snow; it fell most in northern Bohemia, with often up to 18 centimeters of snow.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, it fell up to 15 centimeters of snow.
The snow was gradually disappearing in the Czech Republic.
Americans have a new "smart weapon"
The U.S. Army sent a new "smart" weapon to Afghanistan, known only as XM-25.
The generals think that this new automatic gun will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and will "change the game" for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super-precise cannon
Its missiles are guided by laser with a precision of a few meters.
The special 25 mm caliber ammo developed for this gun and containing a high-brilling explosive actually works like small grenades.
Ammunitions can be programmed in such a way that they will explode at the target contact but also at any point of their ballistic route.
Therefore, we can use it against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle, a wall or a hole.
It is no longer protected from above and when it falls on a deadly rain of steel cracks, it can also put it out of action.
According to Richard Audiette, who participated in the development of XM-25, the new gun is the first infantry weapon to use the "smart" technology.
"The soldier uses it primarily in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser radius that determines the distance, thus obtaining a specific point of view, according to which he corrects his target site and relies on the relaxation.
"Let's say you've reached 543 meters."
"When you press the rest, the weapon is loaded and fired at a distance of 543 meters more or less 1, 2, 3 metres," Audiette said.
400 localised jobs
The Fujitsu group moved its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will transfer their place of work to Astro Park, which is currently located in the Marinbader Place office building in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocates its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As said on Wednesday, the giant specialist in computer manufacturing and maintenance, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, located so far on the Marienbader Square of Bad Homburg city, will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge complex office located on Lyoner Straße Street of the Niederrad District of Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokesperson explained that, in the medium term, the group should gather 100 other jobs to date in the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive. In addition, Astro Park's open-air offices are better suited to the working mode of the employees.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was just a tenant.
The Director General, Bernd Wagner, said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is a prime location for us with remarkable infrastructure."
He states that airport connection is just of great importance to a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new movement of an important company within the region brought about the joy of the winners yesterday and led to the disappointment of the losers.
The manager of the economic affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "planetary actor" had been so conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith concerning the place of implantation".
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its implementation is an important light for Niederrad.
The Mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The management soon informed the municipality of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we have proposed our aid to this company," said Mr. Korwisi.
However, friendly relations could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer in the owner of the Marienbader building.
Finally, the economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now to avoid that such an exceptional place remains unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope that the owner and shipowner of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of the Place de l'Hôtel de Ville, used so far by Fujitsu and the "vertical little" neighbor, as well as the rest of the buildings of the Place Marienbad, were part of the controversial construction project of the thermal station.
Fruit of a joint project of the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the train station and the City Hotel. This created many criticisms, not only because of the impressive design of the surfaces that used to serve in part of the parking lot, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and Fujitsu, a computer manufacturer at the time associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German group of Frankfurt Immobilien-Chancen purchased the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the real estate fund Morgan Stanley. One year later, these buildings were sold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group, whose headquarters is located in Tokyo, is considered the third largest supplier of computer products in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides the essential service.
Its branch established in the Rhine-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has a lot more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries present in this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this purpose, 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park building.
This twenty-year-old complex, whose name reminds us of its star-shaped plan, covers, among other things, the headquarters of the Confederation of Electronic and Electrotechnical Industries.
Expulsion of the server by Amazon - Threats to Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is experiencing more and more difficulties.
The Internet Amazon service provider expelled the site specialized in the disclosure of confidential documents from its servers.
This attitude may be hidden from the political pressures that followed the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, is apparently staying in England.
In the United States, Wikileaks is increasingly heavily attacked.
The Wikileaks cyber-activists group no longer has access to its server hosted so far in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
During this time, the prominent American Senator, Joe Lieberman, called the other countries and businesses to boycotter Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is searched for by Interpol, is probably staying in Britain, according to information published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excludes the Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom," said cyber-activists on Wednesday (local time) at the origin of the revelations via the social network Twitter.
Earlier, the cyber company, Amazon, had deleted Wikileaks documents from its servers.
After the publication of the secret diplomatic notes, cyber-activists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to reach the largest number of documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: "Formidable, our dollars are now spent to take care of people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem for Amazon, "they should stop selling books."
The television channel CNN, quoted by Mr. Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon had banned Wikileaks from using its servers after the investigation carried out by Senator Joe Lieberman's collaborators.
The president of the Senate Committee for the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against it, reported the British newspaper, "The Guardian".
"I would have wished Amazon to take this action earlier in the light of previous publications by Wikileaks of classified information," the senator said.
At the same time, Mr. Liebermann called on other countries to refuse to use servers on the platform.
"Wikileaks acts in an illegal, monstrous and unscrupulous manner, thereby endangering our national security and endangering our lives throughout the world," says an independent senator.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks to disseminate the contents of stolen documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, who is sought by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is on the list of persons sought by Interpol.
According to information released by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently described intrigues orchestrated by his detractors the prosecutions committed against him by Sweden.
Wikileaks spokesperson, Kristinn Hrafnson, told London that threats had been made against the site.
"Even calls were made for the murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange is particularly afraid of his safety, said Hrafnsson.
That's why Wikileaks' founder continues to hide.
Hrahnsson was clearly responding to statements made in North America.
In America, former Arkansas Republican Governor Mike Huckabee demanded that Wikileaks be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, the adviser to the Chief of Government, Mr. Stephen Harper, stated on television, in ironically, that Mr. Assange should be "killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a Drone".
During this time, a controversy began between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesperson for American President Barack Obama, described Mr. Assange as "ridiculous and absurd" because Mr. Assange had demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if he was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and had recently disclosed himself to espionage activities.
"I don't know exactly why we have to deal with the opinion of an individual who owns a website," says Mr. Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than the statements of a website."
The U.S. government now fully passes to the test database the protection of its databases.
According to a White House communiqué, Mr. Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Centre for Counter-Terrorism, was appointed responsible for combating fugitives.
Mr. Travers is responsible for setting up "the necessary structural reforms" which are essential after the release of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also has the will to verify the means by which all administrations exchange and protect information.
In addition, the US government announced that it wanted to deal with the security of dissidents and militants if they were ever threatened by Wikileaks' revelations.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," said Philip Crowley, the spokesperson of the Department of State.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice confectioners are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day launch course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
In fact, where does all the ice come from?
From Glacier and the ice machine.
The glacier, that is, in German, the slightly demoded ice confectioner, manufactures the cream according to all the rules of Italian icemaking.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated glass with a spatula, disposes of it in the glass and then starts to sell it.
We do not need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about the ice can't avoid "Gelato-University" from the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The maker of sorbates founded the Ice University in 2003 so that the ice creams coming out of his machines meet the high Italian ideals.
The three-day launch course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
Special courses are also offered on chocolate ice and extend over several days. Also, practical meetings are organized in the private ice cream.
In the midst of the quarantine crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others are just at risk of realizing their burning desire for smooth ice.
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia passing through Hungary.
Jacky, a professor of art education from California, is upset with the Slow Food movement. He wants to offer a European product of quality in the country of the Industrial Ice in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business management consultant and after a few years she wants to get some special things out of this job testing for nerves.
Two Egyptian youths dream of opening a glacier in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian household woman came because her children love Italian ice cream.
The glacier master Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice.
It is decisive not only the good taste, but also the soft flexibility and good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the training the cherry on the national superstructure and, in general, of the south: "Italian ice is just the best: and then it still retains a sacred dose of romance."
The first stage in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers in a large mixer that heats up to 85 degrees by means of an electronic program, then immediately cools down to four degrees.
It then opens a valve installed on the machine: a white pasteurized base cream, based on all kinds of ice cream to milk.
The trainer is immediately questioned: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without stabiliser?
How can you give free courses to the personal pleasure of the experiment?
Mr. Luciano warned against being misled by the spirit of time.
He who speaks only of "manufactured from natural ingredients", may have used stabilizers: the most often a natural product, such as guar grain flour obtained from guar haricot.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only it is necessary to sell it within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the client will only crush ice pellets.
Some modifications of the base mass are allowed.
This becomes more exciting with the aromas.
Master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients acquired in the fruit or confectionery of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powder and pasta.
"the suppliers will all try to show you dozens of aromatized ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Be in fruit sorbitol recipes with sugar and fresh fruit.
It is in the ice creams made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs, becomes a yellow cream and, when added from cocoa powder, forms the basis of all possible desserts to chocolate.
Now, all participants in the course must switch to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to produce four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, moka and noiset with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural ingredients.
The various kinds of fruit ice cream are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purées: from the point of view of taste, this is absolutely not better.
The ice on the nipples does not necessarily contain the taste of the nut when it consists of most nipples.
The kiwi ice, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mixture correctly reflects the taste of ice," says Luciano.
The manufacture of ice is a calculation exercise: if you use the fishing powder with a lot of sugar, you have to reduce the amount of sugar in the basic recipe.
A supplement of sugar is required for ice to lemon.
Luciano presents a device with which it determines the sugar content of the different types of fruit (the grapes are used to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate calculations.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires as much physical intervention as ever.
It's not just the machine manufacturing the basic mass that helps.
There is also a device in which the ice mixture is simultaneously beaten to make it octave and returned to negative temperatures.
Despite all the automations, light panels are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo barges with fruit purée from his head to his feet and thus crushes his fellow students when he escapes from the control of the huge ball mixture.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that "such an incident may occur during each course: it is only a matter of time."
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that experiences the cultivation of genetically modified plants has clouded the European Food Safety Authority.
This indictment is now formulated by the Test Biotech expert group, which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well informed," said Mr. Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech, Munich on Wednesday.
Some information indicates that the president of the EFSA Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and other EFSA experts are under contract with the Ilsi pressure group.
The latter is funded by such groups as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper worked decisively to develop the test requirements of the EFSA for genetically modified plants and was, therefore, clearly in a conflict of interest situation, according to the criticisms made by Mr. Then.
The requirements drawn up correspond to the positions of the pressure group Ilsi by paragraph and thus bear the industry mark which would, in substance, be controlled by the authorities established in Parme in Italy.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech denounces a conflict of interest.
A high-ranking officer of the Efsa recently joined the Swiss food group Syngenta unconditionally or without a transitional period. In doing so, she changed from camp.
A short time ago, even the Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union authority responsible for control and industrial lobbying, which raised both the suspicions of the German Federal Agency for the Environment and European Members.
However, Efsa does not accept the existence of any conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that all reliable data, including those of industry, are exploited as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of Efsa are not prohibited from contacting this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admitted that he was working for the International Life Sciences Institute, Ilsi, based in the United States.
This body is considered to be a neutral forum bringing together experts from, inter alia, science, industry and policy to assess the risks of biotechnology without being the balance of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then disagree with the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any animal feeding test and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know what, for example, are the effects of genetically modified corn caused by the field," says Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not all the genetically modified plant, which does not allow reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how can you find them?" Mr. Then asks about a defendant.
That is also Mrs Angelika Hilbeck's point of view.
This scientist has been researching genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic School.
In this region as well as in the United States, and now in Europe, the industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That is why there are still few researchers who are not related to companies.
In the opinion of the companies, critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck said that "the industry controls security research".
The Stone Trace
Uli Gsell took care of it, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday afternoon, she was in front of the Stuttgart station with her tube on her back.
There was a manif.
He denied it.
The story is known: In September, the excavators came and began to demolish a large part of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: several thousand people protested against the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart's central station into a underground station that would cost several billion.
A large part of the wing was in ruins when the demonstrations resulted in the stopping of construction work.
Broken in 6000, 7,000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the coquillier calcareous) of Crailsheim, a soft and thick peacock built badly between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor living in Eastfieldern.
It's been looking for some fragments.
"These stones are remnants."
"They don't have to disappear."
He enthusiastically declares: "a modest and good market rock, simple and terrestrial."
He said that by cutting it off in the ashes, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
He still doesn't know what he'll do about this fragment.
Rocks have time.
Uli Gsell too.
the traces of the stones of Stuttgart lead to a former deposit of ammunition of the French army in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his empire of stones.
This 44-year-old man is trading old stones.
He bought all the stones from the collapse that occurred in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were destroyed or if they disappeared in the download," he said in his office in a cabin, which was once a guard post.
He reported that he was the object of insults and threats when the newspapers reported in September that he had bought the rest of the north wing to the demolition company.
But he has been negotiating for days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything to resist the destruction.
And if it does, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using the stones.
Approximately 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently took one of the stone parallels weighing an average of 80 kilos whose value is between 6,50 and 14 euros.
Some keep it as a memory in all while also hoping to be able to make it when a reconstruction takes place.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half is still trapped in the forest, the rest of which has been sold for a long time.
Owners of gardens, landscape gardeners, Specialists.
They came from everywhere and took everything that could enter the trunk and the trailers.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long been transformed into "Mäuerle" or a limitation of the weed plates.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," says Mr. Rongen.
"it was this political component."
He enters his car all over the country, turns his vast empire of 20 hectares.
He did legal studies that he left behind, and later he started studying biology before becoming a computerist and eventually a career.
And a stone fan.
The stock of 40000 tonnes.
He loves his treasures everywhere in Germany.
He claims to be the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He's getting cold.
Sandstones carved with art are placed on the snow.
"At the same time, they were part of the Marienbrücke Bridge in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, says it with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
He's on his way up through the forest.
It shows a pocket of the finger: Peter of red sand, previously part of the Karlsruhe station.
And so on.
"Feel the travertine."
The parallel pipe was already part of the Neckarstadium in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the Cannsstatt travertine from the police prefecture, the red granite from the Holy Blasien Cathedral, the tuft from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What work, what effort, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that since the stones were carved by hand and moved by simple pallets and wagons drawn by cattle, he becomes quite respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage were put into practice."
He didn't become rich, even less rich.
But today this career employs 14 people. In addition, stone cutters, a sculptor, a forger, a glass blower and a gardener have settled in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's gratifying," says the waste recycling.
Next time, he has to go to Cologne.
Over there too, there are rocks to save.
Fighting talent to gain the highest potential
The counter knows a live affluence.
16 students go shopping for small bread at the salmon, tomato sauce and white food.
The technical university of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited design and mechanical engineering students to a workshop.
As part of a kind of competition of ideas, they must talk professionally about the car of the future with VW designers, and, in passing, know the company Volkswagen.
Today, many businesses do not hesitate to go to body in competition to destroy better brains and engage, like Volkswagen, in multiform cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruit the most qualified graduates as much as possible in the amphitheatres before they arrive on the labour market and are not courted by others.
And since universities do not make statements on the performance of their students, there is an attempt to identify exceptional talents in practical projects and to trust them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the technical university of Brauschweig, the car group adjusts the talents.
A young lady in the staff service shares styles, bonuses and cards containing the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the schedule of professional internships and student work for young talent; she shows them the ways to access the whole group.
It is Nico Selle of Braunschweig Technical University who is responsible for the project undertaken with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual benefits for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industry and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen group, he can get to know the students, look closer to the serious candidates and appreciate those who enter into an online account as a collaborator."
According to Mr. Séle, such cooperation is unusual.
What's new is the offensive that we're trying to attract students.
"At the same time, the focus was on the professional project," says Mr. Selle.
The fight for the conquest of new graduates will become much more acute.
In the sectors, companies are no longer able to recruit their employees by conducting a three-year run on a candidate recruit.
But they must boast of their reliability and, above all, courtesy of the highly qualified hand of work.
These are especially the graduates from the engineering lines who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German VDI engineers, more than 40,000 engineering posts remained unoccupied in October.
And according to VDI's estimates, the gap in engineering positions will be further increased.
Roman Dykta goes to talent hunting for KPMG, audit office, accounting expertise and advice.
It organizes expensive events for talent recruitment, such as KPMG-Race cruise race, a type of rally paper where competitors need to find their way with GPS coordinates.
The company will therefore send eight promising students next year to travel through the United States in this way.
Participants can also visit KPMG's branches and know the company.
The person who is required to participate shall decide in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the many candidates will be involved for the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the resources used to search for high potentials in universities are becoming more and more important.
"We want to emerge from the lot thanks to the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little."
For the talent hunter who is Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there.
"To this day, we have remained in touch with all those who participated in a similar action last year."
"Some of them are about to finish their studies and want to send their applications to our company soon," he said.
In addition to the direct adjustment carried out in the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises generally take part in the professional fairs where they deliver themselves to the brain hunt.
"We're trying to reach graduates by participating in the trade fairs."
"For example, at the solar technology salon," says Ms. Sitha Stübe, Director of Human Resources at Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This company in Bonn employs some 1,500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe was aware of the problem of retrieval.
Currently, 35 posts are placed on the company's website.
"At this point, it is very difficult to provide vacant posts."
"This cost is expensive and takes a lot of time," he says.
Another way to establish contact is to pass through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, such as the University of Fribourg.
"The professors indicate that the student has the opportunity to perform professional internships or to write his final study project at home."
Heavy advertising campaigns are announced among solar specialists.
This is why the company tries to make its advertising by putting other qualities into practice: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Frequently, a large group cannot do this," says Ms. Stübe, chief of staff.
For a long time, money no longer plays the main role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities are the other determining factors.
According to a study conducted by the Institute Great Place to Work, Solarworld occupies 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute is an annual honour table for German employers.
To this end, he questioned the level of satisfaction of the employees in relation to their work and its context, while looking at the employees' framework conditions.
The head of staff, Ms. Stübe, hopes that this will increase the image of society among employers.
"I think that candidates return to external evaluations especially with regard to a potential employer," she said.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Academy, DEBA) advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, this means, first of all, to take internal measures.
"The best way for an employer to become attractive is to go through his own employees," he said.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand image within its own workforce.
"satisfied collaborators form the best messengers."
When his employees are treated well and they identify themselves with the company, they do all they can to advertise their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
"It's like playing in an orchestra," says Mr. Kriegler.
Obama sets a brake on new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico beyond the coast of Florida, the state of the south-east of the United States, in the coming years.
The Washington Government has issued a ban on an equivalent ban and has thus definitively annulled its initial plans.
Even beyond the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains for the moment prohibited.
The Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar made this announcement on Wednesday.
It is the explosion in April of the "deepwater Horizon" drilling platform that is the source of this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
With regard to this accident, which cost life to 11 employees and leads to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, who was under pressure from the opposition and this sector of activity, had indicated that he was willing to authorize new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The parties to this solution want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries on oil supplies.
The question of who bears the responsibility of the devastating black sea in the Gulf is not, to this day, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which faces several billion claims for compensation, is at the centre of the charges.
A committee of inquiry set up by Obama must present its findings in December.
In October, the Secretary of Interior, Ken Salazar, had lifted the gel from the drill decreed after the explosion of the platform.
Following this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With more stringent controls and more stringent safety signs, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which has discredited itself after many corruption charges, is currently subject to in-depth reforms.
At the same time, Mr. Obama announced that they would eliminate the lucrative tax niches of the gas and oil groups.
Activators in this sector are now publicly warning against the fact that the flow of food in the golf course would be significantly lower than it is so far.
"The goal of the government is to put a stop to the rapid growth of the gas and oil sector" according to the result of a current survey carried out in the sector by the BDO audit firm before the ban on drilling pronounced on Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Energy Alliance regrets the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows exactly what will change with the regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been postponed to a new order, to the detriment of growth.
The country of Ogoni is dry
The water flowing into the rivers is browned; it extracts a smell similar to that in the gas station: Because of a leak, billions of gallons of crude oil have destroyed the country of Ogoni in Nigeria.
Men live for theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't get exhausted," the environmentalist activist launches to the journalists to calm them down: "You still have enough oil bubbles in front of the water lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young man immersed in the boiling water up to his chest, as well as the fat train that surrounds him: this scene seems almost beautiful in the stream of water to the colour of the rainbow.
We can't see that the ground floor is filled with brown crude oil spikes.
On the bank of the Bodo-Jetti River, Esther Badom tells us that, in fact, she was collecting shrimps by whole seals here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have completely tari.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil was wasted by an oil pipeline that exploded in the huge oil spill.
Fishermen living in the small nearby town of Bodo must now gather for six hours to reach the fishing waters: The country of Ogoni located at the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The entire stretch of the ruins jumps into the eyes when you pass the mangrove tides through watercourses.
Instead of a clear water, the motor boat pours a brown water. Whoever dips his hand in it removes any oil cover.
The roots of small mangrove roots emerge from the ground as church bars. The isolated palm trees leave their palm hanging sadly.
We are looking for the nests of birds, as we usually meet them in wet areas: If the engine stops off, a fantastic silence lies on this paradise of times that resembles a service station by the smell it takes.
"What happens here is a war against the environment," says Mr. Celestine Akpobari of a sad air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger to health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where Ogoni live is a battlefield inhabited for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. It was later executed. In 1993, the Shell Group had to interrupt its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Today, the return to Ogoni is still prohibited to this company: whereas more than 2 million black gold barrels are pumped daily through more than 5000 wells and 7,000 kilometres of oil pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields in Ogoni are unexploited, because the situation is too unstable for this oil group.
All a few hundred meters stand in the water of steel tiles as strange sculptures: "Christmas trees" are very affectionately referred to as the head of hole holes.
They are up to 50 years old, most are torn by corrosion to the track.
Akpobari believes that a drilling head of this kind breaks down from time to time in pieces, because a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
According to experts estimates, more than two billion litres of oil fell on the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that that went into the sea during the "Exxon Valdez" super oil accident 21 years ago outside Alaska, one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of humanity.
Who should bear the responsibility of persistent environmental pollution? The answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell group, the sabotage and syphony of the pipelines are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution. Environmentalists, for their part, consider the explosions of the drilling heads and perforated pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, American researcher Richard Steiner complained to Shell Group to apply Nigeria's safety standards much less stringent than anywhere else in the world: Only the failure rate of conducts is "far higher than then".
Some forms emerge from mangroves in a place that, seen from a distance, resembles a abandoned workshop, full of camouflages and installed in the open air: they are completely naked and covered with camouflages up to the neck.
A flashlight under one of the many tunnels that is both connected to the pipes, both spread out without reason on the site must be detected: a small hidden refinery.
We're heating the crude oil in the tunnel for several hours, explains Michael, the team leader.
At first, the fuel penetrates into a container through pipes, then to the end of the conduction of kerosene drops falls and eventually it is obtained from diesel.
This is how Michael and his four employees produce four 300 litre diesel barrels daily: "This reports 34,000 Naira", approximately $22.
Delta residents take advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil producing country in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a price less expensive than that ridiculously low to almost 40 cents of Euro per litre of Diesel: because they acquire their raw material free of charge.
It is offered by the "protectors" who put the pipeline network into circulation throughout the country of Ogoni. According to experts, the country thus loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a very small part of the stockpiled raw material is illegally cleaned: The organized crime networks, which also include high-ranking politicians and military members, load the lion's share in tankers and the brand on the world market.
The Akpobari militant believes that the debate on whether to attribute environmental disasters or rather subversive activities to the population or to the mode of lactic production is purely academic.
"If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of the fishermen's life were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no theft and illegal refineries."
But, in the meantime, Ogoni's relations especially with Shell have deteriorated so much that it was no longer a matter of withdrawal of the group. "Perhaps operators with other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will become better."
So Michael gets nervous.
"It's a great time for you to get out of here" announces the robust oil worker.
"Soldiers can show up at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be the subject of an arrest, but will most certainly offer them potable wine.
Even soldiers primarily from the north of the country will enjoy as all Nigerians of the raw material.
"From every point of view, this trick has made our country very low," Akpori regrets.
Investigators discover construction defects in A380 reactors
The A380 is obviously suffering from a major security problem.
By examining a device that made an emergency landing, the investigators discovered a possible construction defect that could lead to "catastrophic reactor failure."
The Air Company Qantas now wants to bring complaints against the reactor manufacturer.
At the beginning of November, Airbus passengers belonging to the company Quantas had so far been more likely: During the investigation carried out, the Australian air safety authority found that the reactors of certain A380 devices presented a serious security problem, and it cautioned against a possible lack of construction.
This potential failure could have serious consequences: it can cause fatigue and leaks at the level of connection of the oil pipeline, is indicated in a position published this Thursday by the ATSB administration.
It could have led to a "catastrophic reactor failure".
The Rolls-Royce reactors are involved and 20 A380 series aircraft are equipped.
The airbus from the company Quantas, which had to land urgently on 4 November in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now launched prosecutions against the English reactor manufacturer.
She filed a judicial complaint with an Australian federal court whose seat is located in Sydney, which allows her to take other legal measures against society.
The director of Quantas, Alan Joyce, stated that his company would claim damages for the incident that occurred at the beginning of November.
Parts have been removed and the wearer surface has been damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is oil inflammation that is the source of the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators announced that other safety tests would be carried out on superjumbos that are also equipped with the reactors in question.
Security recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ASTB spokesperson Martin Dolan.
The security problem is considered to be important enough to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of her plane, the air carrier Quantas had immobilized her entire fleet of A380 for a week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily immobilized three of its 11 A380.
Lufthansa replaced the A380 reactor by a precautionary measure.
The two-storey plane is the world's largest liner.
Snowfall across the territory causes chaos in transport
Germany all over white: In one night, snow fell on almost the whole country.
Chaos rule on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter makes Germany grellotter: By ice temperatures, almost the whole Republic is covered with snow on Thursday night, leading to chaos in many localities.
In the north and east, the snow cover reaches 15 centimeters per place.
Traffic is heavily restricted on several motorways and on many roads.
On the Flensburg National A7, the winter service staff worked permanently, but they were unable to finish the snow that never ceased to accumulate.
In addition, rapists have swam the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Bureau for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects that the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein is located with water levels that can reach 1.2 m above normal.
Snowfalls on highways and on federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That is why the bad weather warning centre Meteomedia announced the level of violet alert was announced in the Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
By places, it fell 30 centimeters of fresh snow that the strong and fresh winds scattered.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
Even in the Saxe-Anhalt country, police authorities have reported serious road disturbances.
On the A2 motorway, snow and wind caused a traffic interruption and caused noise.
In Thuringia, snowfalls affected motorways A4 and A9.
According to the Deutscher Bahn, serious railway traffic disturbances occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on the railways, trees fallen on the railways, chains or destroyed needles.
In Saxony, the interregional transport of Leipzig-Nuremberg had to be interrupted.
In Salfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to stop its journey.
The firefighters and paramedics had to provide the 165 passengers from the train with blankets, food and drinks.
Snow winds blew the roads.
Snowflakes have resulted in many flight cancellations in Germany's main airports.
According to a standard password and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesman for Fraport indicates that 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt on Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that the passengers at the airport are no longer numerous, although only 400 beds are available.
Accidents took place on Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life during a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Because of the snow layers present on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was hit by a level crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured in the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car landed on a slippery floor in Ascharchenburg.
However, meteorologists announce a good news: snow will certainly always be soft and powdery, but it will turbulence in the case of light light.
But the wind will sink.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by violent and rapid winds.
However, it is very cold, up to 15 degrees per place.
The Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
The deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to the information reported by newspapers, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could report up to EUR 500 million.
The Deutsche Bank has just decorated the headquarters of the group: The twin towers located in the Business Quarter have been modernized; while waiting, the bankers had to return to their former place of service.
The financial group is obviously looking to recover the costs of renovations and is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland", quoted as saying.
This password did not indicate the reasons for the proposed sale.
He stated that "we check whether it is more interesting to take care of the buildings ourselves or sell them, and re-hire them later".
This is how Germany's largest financial institution has already given up its seat, shortly after.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank acquired the twin towers for 272 million Euros from the owners of own funds, and they were then rehabilitated.
The energy optimization transformations amounted to around €200 million, according to some indications.
There was obviously a lot of money reported to the bank.
According to the information provided by the newspaper, experts in this business sector estimate the value of the rounds, which were rebaptised in the meantime "Green Tours", to about EUR 500 million.
According to the password, it is currently unknown whether the buildings will be resold to a bank-owned fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people are crying to the missing minors.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought for displaced minors who were declared dead following several explosions in a mine.
We had not yet been able to get the bodies back up because the safety situation of the sintered well continues to be worrying.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion took place in Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 minors between the ages of 17 and 62 had been raised underground.
A probe had been introduced into the sintered well, but no trace of survivors had been found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that followed, no rescue team was able to descend into the mine for security reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and administration considered that minors no longer had any chance of survival.
Until then, the bodies couldn't be lifted.
Today, parents and friends have arranged a memorial party for the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a rising sun in Greymouth south of New Zealand.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 minors, 29 tables were installed on which names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
The photos and personal effects, including the clothes and surfboards, were also in place.
The flags were set in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants at the commemorative celebration that New Zealand had given hope that minors would rise to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the trenches, said he could not give up accepting the death of his son until he had seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the victim's parents, several foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative celebration.
Minors of South African and British origin also set up during the first explosion of 19 November.
The rescuers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
Police prefect Gary Knowles explained to journalists that when the mass of explosive gases is moved, the burning temperatures inside the mine are beginning to fall.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is Splatter an artificial movie?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the old genre thanks to his film, "Wallala Rising", the epoch of the fighter.
To what audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think well by turning "Wallala Rising"?
A warrior Viking (Mads Mikkelsen) with only one eye is made prisoner; he frees himself from his burrow and, with almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents one after another. This seems ideal for young male spectators seeking a bloody action, just because our hero uses brutal murder methods. When he is in a bad mood, he pulls the intestines of his enemies without waiting for them to die.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the village doesn't say a word on its real name. Even the other characters let escape, at the most, around one or two phrases some excruciating screams of agony.
Otherwise, we don't say anything and celebrate in the mountain landscape incredibly beautiful Scotland, which is the decoration of the Vikings' universe, about a thousand years ago.
It would be ideal more for mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent travels.
When a film aims at several target groups, it is damaging that these groups are mutually excluded.
The director Winding Refn is considered, since the release of "Pusher", his trilogy regarding the drug dealer faroche and full of style, as a kind of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but he refuses to bring a little more humor to the dominant current or introduce a little less brutality to the art and test cinema.
Most of the sympathetic artists in the art film must experience horror in the face of the brain that spreads around and in the intestines.
Lovers of action films die of boredom, when the town gets on board, for reasons that one can freely interpret, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship destined for Jerusalem; they are drowned for eternity by calm and noise before the crew arrives in America and continues to tarnish.
It is not surprising, then, that "Wallala Rising" did not find any film distributor in Germany and that it exists only in DVD format.
It is mainly because of the magnificent images of poverty that have deserved a certain attention, but also because the image of a film that is palpitating, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
These are not dialogues in this film, nor a coherent action, everything is ambience, a febrile dream transformed into a film.
The viewer can't get away with it.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts off his throat with glacial images and a lupus sound band, but especially with an insatiable hatred that gnawed the hearts of the characters.
Only a young blond boy, who is faithfully holding to the side of the village, preserves some innocence, all others are animated by anger.
Above all, the bourgeois hero whose cell phones are never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and provisionally allies by turning himself into a warrior, may be sent by the devil himself.
It represents the defeat, but perhaps also nothing but for those who are, in any case, mad.
"Wallala Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, which has the purpose of passion, enthusiasm and surprise.
It's a traumatic experience.
Mystical terrace work
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new information on a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a stand on this issue, even less to submit to the Agency's controls.
On the night of 5-6 September 2007 to midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft attacked a mysterious cube-shaped building in the Syrian territory.
It is located on the bank of the Euphrates; the largest city nearby is 30 kilometers: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name appears in the IAEA documents because it is the question of the reactor that Syria has built with the help of North Korea in a stone parallel pipeline, dissimulated in a valley marked by the absence of electric current.
According to a U.S. information services briefing, the CIA, dated end April 2008, the current reactor, known as the neighbouring locality, El Kibar, would be well suited to produce plutonium, which would allow the manufacture of atomic weapons.
On the other hand, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video containing thin satellite images.
Through computer-aided animation, it indicated the likely location of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the power plant, which represents a copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the pictures showing the nearby building, or the inside of the building.
It seems that the reactor was about to be put into service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, there is little more information available than at the time, and even, in time, the mystery is growing.
The former U.S. president George W. Bush recently revealed in his memories that prior to this attack, the CIA was certain that Syria had built a reactor to El Kibar, but had little evidence showing that the country was developing "an active nuclear weapons program".
Some information agents in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of a "presumptuous reactor", even though they consider the CIA's presentation as "pleasable".
They lack tangible evidence, as well as IAEA.
Inquiring about the way in which he made sure that he had dealt with a nuclear reactor, a high-ranking United Nations diplomat gave only a laconic response in the summer, stating that IAEA had "sufficient documents to ask questions".
The Syrians had certainly taken away the ruins of the "unutilized military building" with a rush and a methodical landing of the land.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team of experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen, discovered in el-Kibar traces of uranium produced by men.
In addition, IAEA has received through a Member State satellite images of commercial vendors showing the moment that directly followed the attack. It appears that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous commander, perhaps Israel, has acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always ensured that it has never implemented a secret atomic program and that it has not built a reactor.
Damas argues that the uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
However, the IAEA rejected this argument after analysis of the particles by qualifying them as invertebrates.
Since then, Damas has refused any discussion on this, as well as on satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to conduct a second inspection on the El Kibar site and refuses access to the debris of the building destroyed by the bomb.
Even Israel, however, keeps silent.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in exercise at the time of the attack, recently stated: "We will never comment on this."
This is how the investigation into this case has been taking place since June 2008 without a result being achieved and that it "becomes increasingly a serious issue of the Agency's credibility", as recognized by a senior Western diplomat in service at IAEA headquarters in Vienna, ultimately a serious violation of the nuclear-weapon-ban treaty.
The IAEA considers that in order to make progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of the three other facilities that must have "a functional relationship" with the alleged reactor.
To date, the inspectors have not indicated what facilities they are here, what their function is, or what they are suspected of containing.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung", they are known within the IAEA under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandarayah as neighbouring cities as well.
Washington's Independent Institute for Science and International Security identified these sites and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would most likely be one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in a military base or directly next to it; that is exactly why Syria refuses to access the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians refrain from the inspection group being actually spies sent on behalf of the United States by IAEA to spy on military facilities.
In fact, it is information provided by U.S. secret agents that draws the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made shuttles between the three sites and the parallel stone pipeline to transport substances.
A high-ranking Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "serve fuel production".
There would be no "significance on sensitive activities", such as enrichment and removal of uranium; processes that are essential for the production of nuclear weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works thanks to the non-rich uranium.
However, there is a rigidity of plausible assumptions regarding the following fundamental issues: where uranium should have come from and where the plutonium needed for the manufacture of the bomb was later separated.
It is unknown whether the engravings, which could hide high-value traces, were stored in the three sites.
When hundreds of land trucks have disappeared, no one will have any information on the place where the gravity is stored.
For IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had examined the al-Tibni salt mine in 1998, located just a few kilometres from el-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, to see if it could be suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
By recently analyzing photos taken by satellite on behalf of the famous Jane's Intelligence Review magazine, the former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley has established a link between them and the reactor in question.
Satellite photos show, however, that Syria has undertaken a terrace work in the three suspected sites and has moved huge containers when IAEA began to demand access to these sites.
This may be a coincidence, but it has not helped to remove the suspicions.
It states in the diplomatic environment that IAEA has spent several months drawing up a plan on the inspections to be carried out. This plan should allow Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Only time spent investing shows how much interest the inspectors have in this case.
During this time, Damascus also ended this proposal.
A year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the urgency would not be reported for this case, for example, Glyn Davies, the US ambassador who has been referring to special inspections for a few months, one of the most powerful means available to the Atomic Agency to carry out its controls.
The IAEA Director, Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has certainly already spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future", but he is still hesitated.
This means a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors and a large number of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation get up.
on the other hand, like this diplomat who gives thought to, "That's what it would be like if they finally found nothing."
Love in Time of War
It's been bad ever since Angelina Jolie made her debut in summer as a director.
She wrote the script herself: it is a story of love between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
We don't know anything more about this story, but that's enough to provoke Malaysian.
A persistent rumor indicates that the Muslim woman fell in love with her Serbian noise during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women's federations immediately protested. In response, some of the planned shootings in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary in the last minute.
Meanwhile, the film was filmed in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continue in Bosnia.
According to the information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women victims of war addressed Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and requested to meet the actress. Jolie herself is an ambassador of UNHCR's goodwill.
She is not a diplomat. A few weeks ago, she proposed to these women to have a meeting with them in Hungary, but they declined this offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," says Hasecic.
There were no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario says quite a long time about her attitude toward the victims.
The Guardian reports that the Hasecic organization subsequently recommended to the United Nations High Commissioner for Foreign Affairs to withdraw the quality of Goodwill Embassy in Angelina Jolie.
But in fact, what kind of scenario did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its script, granted a tour permit to Sarajevo after a few hesitations, but we do not know why it did not then come despite this authorization.
The young author assures herself that she does not pursue political goals with her film, which is by making a lot of efforts that she has made in the wake of the Yugoslavian conflict. She argues that she wants to exert the terrible consequences of the war and give all parties the opportunity to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
This is the way a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It's quite different: Lovers knew each other well before the war began. They meet each other again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
Which is still a big difference with the version "a victim of rape falls in love with his bull.
That Jolie's film started well before the war, of course.
The pressure exerted on her, as Jolie puts it, is "unjust and based on wrong information".
Now, only Hollywood fans can find peace: By illegally putting this scenario in the Net, as well as many others before.
Let's get out of here!
Tonight, everything goes well again with the Irish.
no trace of consternation.
That is why the local team is overdominating visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans shout with joy at the bottom of a strong music, they hit their feet.

Cian Tanner is a calm individual; this subtle drinking game and the computerist reserved, these two behaviors are really not going well together.
And yet, the 26-year-old man seeks to have fun, to turn away from the terrible issue, which will result in the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not listed in his projects. In January, he will conduct recruitment interviews in New Zealand.
"I'm trying a strange feeling, however," he says.
"The country is so far away and I don't have a job."
Finally: Her girlfriend is already waiting for her in Auckland, "in less than two, she has laid off her desired job as an event project manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man smiling.
Because of the country's dark perspectives, two of Tanner's three sisters tried their chance abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, and his brother Colin now holds a computer consulting post in London.
Young people go: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of tanners.
Experts from the Institute of Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even provide for a number of 200,000 migrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If these forecasts are fulfilled, they will be similar to those suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish have enjoyed great ease, grief is now taking its place.
However, the economic crisis is particularly affecting well-trained young Irish people who have so far not known the moment of happiness.
The loss of employment and social unemployment seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's too much money.
But in the meantime, three out of ten people under 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times newspaper publishes plenty of letters of readers written by young immigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything goes to waste."
"There should be an upsurge against politicians and bankers, but the one who has the opportunity to do so goes away and our country has been doing so for a whole generation."
"The last one to get out of the light."
The law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Students' Union, sees a darker future because the government only throws dust into the eyes and offers no prospect of the future to young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the young student of 20 years old.
She sees her friends crash from an unpaid practical traineeship to another.
She states that her greatest concern is to migrate herself within four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnnon try to address this issue positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingObroadExpo" exhibition, which offers full support on the theme "Working abroad".
"But working abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for new people in the profession to take the first steps in the stages of the professional hierarchy," says the manager.
Its website shows photos of surfing in Australia and snow surfing in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a gallery, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Sean O'Donovan, knows what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing more to be done in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector in Germany.
A fashion house just came out of the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannover or Berlin projects.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely visits his country of origin because he participates in an additional job in order to be able to complete the repayment of the credit contracted to build his home in the country of origin.
"The situation is already a bit dingy," he says by breaking the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I almost no longer live."
He bursts with a laugh, bored through the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-maintained front gardens, expensive large brands cars are stationed on access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister for an amount of 380,000 euros, 100% financed by the credit.
"There were times of madness, no doubt the money was easy," he said.
Is he afraid to see everything collapse because of the credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, takes a warm cup of tea and says, "I don't have children to entertain and I'm young; even everything goes through, I can go to zero."
The building engineer does not like the complaints he often hears in recent times.
"No one should suffer from hunger, our situation is not as dramatic as what we once lived here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while, that's not what can get worse, maybe it's what makes us feel Irish first.
He then laughs and talks about his father who went to England during the last great economic crisis.
"He was back after he had spent seven years and, in Ireland, life continued, simply."
This idea please Cian Tanner.
Leave the future and discover how life goes elsewhere.
In his palm trees, he already has a few years of work in London. That's why life doesn't have to be so easy in New Zealand for him and his friend.
But there's still one thing that worries you about these last days: the festival to be held on the occasion of its 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He's afraid she can't turn into a good-bye dinner.
"Only, not much emotion," he says by drinking a long beer gorge.
"A good-bye, it seems equally disturbing."
"Let's call it a night to see each other, all relaxed, gathering some friends, with a few drinks and a few games."
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as well as for private enterprises.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the last Latinobarometer survey taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been carried out regularly since 1995, it follows the change of attitude in the region.
Two related elements are the results of this year's survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the Pacific of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6 per cent per year since 2002, support for democracy has grown from at least 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
It has also increased in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after a strong fall in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, reducing the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44 per cent of the region's respondents expressed satisfaction with the way their country's democracy worked in practice; this was the same figure as last year, but with a strong increase of 25 per cent in 2001 (Figure 3)
Some 34% said they had confidence in their country's Parliament and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; however, they grew sharply compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America broke down support for democracy.
If this has been good during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in the United States have suffered only a short recession and have received a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and again fell to 32 per cent this year.)
But the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Figure 4).
Brazil's good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is translated into a widely shared sense of progress
What is rarer in Mexico and Central America, where recession has been more severe and where violent crimes have worsened.
This is only for the second time since the survey started only more respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see table 5).
Some 31% say that they themselves or one of their relatives have been the victim of a criminal act in the past year; however, this figure has fallen by 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A stronger economic performance is reflected in the increase in support for private enterprise and the market economy: approximately 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Figure 6).
Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of Venezuela's respondents are of this opinion (and 80% support the private company); although their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, is expropriating from many private companies.
Brazil is the largest minor in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged compared to last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% since last year)
But the United States is considered by respondents to Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A dull vote
No one expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on 28 November.
But it was much worse than the visitors who wanted to help the country synistrated and drowned in fear.
Voting boxes and a new ballot were presented, ballot papers distributed in gouts, desks and intimidations.
The polling stations would open late at night.
Many Haitians, including many who were displaced after the January earthquake, would be in the neighborhood to find a place to vote.
Some of them ended up giving up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including a number of alleged supporters, have denounced the fraud and have claimed the cancellation of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, views the event as "a pretty good election in many ways".
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said prudently that "they did not believe that these irregularities, as serious as they are, had necessarily disabled the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are liable to René Préval, the outgoing President, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, must announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The second expected tour is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapist, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared null.
But there may be problems if Mr. Célestin, who has little or no perceived support for the electorate, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second tour reached the second tour.
With a cholera epidemic that rages, and more than 1 million survivors of the earthquake still living in tents, it was feared that participation would be.
Many Haitians wanted to vote, but they were prevented from voting because of the disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards needed to vote were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The problem is important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in Haiti's reconstruction.
And so, of course, the Haitians do it themselves.
The point of the feet towards the center
The weeks after becoming a widow suddenly, Cristina Fernández, president of Argentina, benefited from a wave of public sympathy that improved her approval rate of 20 points, at more than 50%; this was her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, turning this into a successful second term campaign in a election next year could depend on Mrs. Fernández's choice, apparently in mourning, that she would either abandon the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, had the habit of developing budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This enabled the first couple to spend additional income on a voluntary basis.
The government of Mrs Fernández lost its majority in Congress last year on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has dimmed in the afterlife of Mr. Kirchner from a heart attack on October 27th.
Some of the dissident members of the peronist movement to power joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (where a parliamentarian hit one of his peers and others accused the corruption government), Congress did not approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," said the president.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the president an even greater margin of manoeuvre for voluntary spending.
The economy is overheating widely: it is likely to grow almost 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is now 11.1%, but many private estimates and union wage claims see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took up his duties in 2003 when Argentina was afraid of economic collapse, made a priority of growth and poverty reduction rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purged INDIC, the statistical office, which carried out falsifications of official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now moderate these policies?
She called for talks between private companies and union leaders.
And its staff say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy was stimulated by high global prices of Argentina's agricultural exports.
However, inflation has eroded the rate of growth as a result of a strong assessment in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernández showed signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations to the rest of the world.
This year, the government concluded an agreement with the debtors who had refused a forced prior restructuring of the debt for which Argentina had not settled its schedules in 2001.
Now Ms. Fernández seems to be coming towards an agreement with creditors governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it belongs some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this could not involve IMF surveillance, as usual.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economics, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national index of consumer prices, which is similar to a prelude to the sanitation of INDIC.
It is unclear whether Ms. Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term of office, now that her husband is no longer with her.
If she does, she needs to gain support from the middle class, among which the chirchnerism is very popular.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacations in Mars, the wave of sympathy for her will have reflected.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether or not to repudiate many of her husband's policies without noise.
A Half-Hour for China
Taiwanese electors are heading towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
How does Taiwan feel about his great brother on the other side of the river?
More than 7.5 million electors presented themselves on 27 November, 70 per cent of eligible persons, to elect mayors and municipal councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment of the President, Ma Ying-jou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a substitute for the feelings towards the continent, having established innovative business links, including a partial free trade pact, in the largest reorganization of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. I did my test, but it's all right.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three of the five ranks, he failed to win the majority.
Instead, the Democratic and Progressive Party (DPP), which focused on Taiwan's full independence, won almost 50% of all votes for KMT by 45%.
If it had been a presidential vote, Mr. Ma would have been difficult.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP has attracted voters, even with KMT in municipal councils.
The event revealed most of the main subjects of the Taiwanese elections, including pick-up trucks and mass-collection flags with girls who danced at least.
An attempt to kill a mandatory mystery has also been carried out.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, held an election tour for a KMT candidate in the election watch.
A man of the crowd shot young Mr. Lien, purely through his face, hurting and killing a passerby.
Curiously, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Link or settle a dispute with the candidate.
However, Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, said the killer had consequences on the election by leading the suspicion of the DPP and turning the voters to the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest voter was China.
It was striking how much the question of the continental part itself was absent.
Instead, the candidates played with plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its actual independence and hates China's military threat.
Thus, KMT tends to avoid interfering with the Government of Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from waiting for the anti-Chinese feeling.
This is the response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, claimed confirmation as to whether his China policy was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing government will continue to provide commercial facilities, in line with its strategy aimed at bringing Taiwan back to life.
China has not wasted any time sending a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but let's start at the beginning.
Better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself in any way.
Two years ago, he went wrong: his former boss, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison for corruption charges.
From 2000 to 2008, he was a challenger for explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has seen the day under the leadership of Ms. Tsai and the PDP working hard to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was hailed as a DPP candidate for the presidency, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he can also engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for an expert panel to act as a contact point between DPP and China, provided that their interviews could take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party presented a "reliable alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement issued from its cell, he stated that PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan was a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to give up the presidency.
Even without the intervention of Mr. Chen, the DPP will have trouble choosing among its potential candidates.
KMT must do an introspection of itself.
Mr. Ma's evaluations have been low; despite considerable economic growth, KMT's candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening of the gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesperson says his office and his local antennas will be replaced.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's support for reconciliation is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, an eminent editor, "the point of no return has already passed."
Appointments to Grammy Awards: the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a selected surprise in the category "Best New Artist"
Perform at the request of a president, and people are required to learn about it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer who was taken by hand by President Obama at his Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, marked one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a big nomination in the category of the "best new artist".
Considering that Spalding is a very well-known figure on the jazz scene since its 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination remains a bit mysterious but it is compatible with the Grammy Awards rules that an artist must not leave more than three albums before registration; this "establishs the public identity of this artist."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given its slightly engaging vocal style, its skilled pop and funk hand and its Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one line pointed at Spalding compared to Norah Jones's outstanding success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy Awards electors, taking into account jazz productions in this category in recent years.
In addition, Grammy Awards electors have just honoured Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" in the "instrumental album" category, a turning on a revitalizing frison of a recording that was one of the most important favors last year.
Among these yesterday, "Moody 4B" by the veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by the keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, supported by the noise of the New Orleans and often invited to HBO's "Treme", has been honored in the contemporary jazz category, which is also strongly inclined to a certain merger with Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber's albums.
Secret Society of the Wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with the steampunk, won some well-deserved awards in the large group; in competition with the rich-jazz chamber of Billy Childs Assemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" of his octet's live was a good example of the democratic hand of this bassist as group leader.
Grammy Awards nomination: Michael Dougherty and Steve Mackey lead in the classic categories
The classic appointments for the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards include a mix of landscapes of musicians and composers all over the world.
In the head of the nominations, quote "Deus Ex Machina" by Michael Daugherty, for the piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and "Dreamhouse" by Steve Mackey, an electric orchestral work, with three "yes".
Among the nominees associated with Southern California, there is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No.4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commanded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and which opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of the composer based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also in high school for a reward.
The classic appointments are divided into 13 categories covering orchestra, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A category for the classic year's producer includes five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classic album are the Symphonies n°3 and 4 of Bruckner of the Royal Orchestra of the Concertgebouw; "Deus Ex Machinea" and "Metropolis Symphony" of Daugherty of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" of Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrifium - the art of the Castrati" featuring various artists; and the "Requiem" of Verdi of Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" by Berg of the Royal Opera House Orchestra, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Adolf Hasse of Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Love de Loin" by Kaija Saariaho of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchestra and the Heart of the Mariinsky Theatre; and "Ivanhoé" by Arthur Sullivan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers that are in place for the Grammy Awards for contemporary composition count Pärt for Symphony n°4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machine", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
Pärt's Symphony No.4 had its first at Disney Hall in January 2009 in an execution recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work is called "Los Angeles" for about 30 minutes and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovski, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's Mandolin Concerto was appointed for solo instrument performance with an orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles said that he had just written the 15-minute work especially for the interpreter at the Avi Avital Mandoline, who played the concerto with the Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York.
"I wrote it using Middle East sounds and a large number of North Africa's ranges and rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The head of the orchestra Pierre Boulez, 85 years old, received an appointment in the category of orchestra performances, to run the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists who received an appointment, we quote the pianoists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; the organist Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only nominated vocalists-solists; these are Anne Sofia Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measa Brueggergosman.
In the classic mix category, soprano Jesse Norman received an appointment for his recording "Racines: my life, my song"
The Temecula mosque project is approved by the Planning Committee.
A Moscow project in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning committee after more than five hours of public witnessing, often passionate.
Critics took over the project, claiming that it promoted both terrorism and trafficking bottlenecks.
But the commissioners decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many people are welcome to support it: Christians, Jews, Bahais, you mention it," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley, speaking on Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of it, as an American citizen."
"It shows that justice takes him."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people speaking for or against the centre, in speaking time almost also distributed, according to the Press Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America," wrote one speaker.
"It's another monkey planet with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centres also caused protests in other parts of the country, including the Ground Zero, instead of the attacks of September 11, 2001, in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush reported violence in the Temecula Valley.
Its assembly of 135 co-existing families in Riverside County has been undisclosed for years, but it wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse it rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new mosque of 24,943 square feet in the Mediterranean style architecture would consist of two mines and would rise to 43 feet high.
It would occupy a site of 4.32 hectares on the Nicolas road about two miles east of the Chaparral High School.
The opponents can still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
A microbe tolerating arsenic raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a foreign bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, expands the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacteria here on Earth, they say that it shows that life has opportunities beyond major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organism has double capacity."
"It can develop either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That's why it's very special, even though it's far from being a really "foreign" life form," commented Paul Davies C. W. of the University of Arizona State, co-author of the report in the online edition of the journal Science on Thursday.
Six major elements have long been considered essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But researchers have discovered that the bacteria, discovered in Lake Mono, California, are able to continue to develop after replacing the phosphorus with arsenic.
"We wonder what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of the University of Arizona State, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the search for life beyond Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the find, generated widespread speculations on the Internet that the report could reveal the discovery of an extraterrestrial life.
That wasn't the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms could be able to use other elements to act on biochemistry and that the "standard" set of elements, which we feel absolutely necessary for life, could not be fixed," commented Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute of Planetary and Space Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the search team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a lucky discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Institute of Astrology, who conducted the study, chose Lake Mono because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, it speculated that a microbe exposed to both substances could be able to replace each other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, organisms have difficulty distinguishing these elements separately."
"But arsenic is quite different so it doesn't work exactly like phosphorus; it penetrates inside and somehow rubbers the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar explained.
Researchers collected the known bacteria called GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing arsenic concentrations to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic at the site raises the possibility that a life form using arsenic can occur naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or the moon where arsenic is more frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, associate professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing has ever shown that this could work.
Arsenic was more frequent at the beginning of Earth's existence, she said; thus, researchers have suggested that the first forms of life could have used it.
This suggests that there may be other ways to form life, not only the way life on Earth was formed at the beginning," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Institute.
The last two stolen exposure dogs were found in Compton
The other two dogs on the outside of a motel in Bellflower were found, the sheriffs of the county of Los Angeles announced it on Thursday.
The four exposure dogs - two acutas and two pembroke gallois corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express truck in which they had spent the night outside a motel 6 in Bellflower, the authorities announced.
Two of the dogs were recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found at the end of Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, the spokesperson of the sheriff's department in the county of Los Angeles.
"The good news is that dogs are going well," says Whitmore.
"They're in good shape."
"They were returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found, in which area and in which circumstances they were discovered.
"An investigation is underway."
"We don't want to say that," Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
Dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were unable to join to comment on Thursday.
They were gathered on Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a county animal shelter in Downey.
The sheriff's assistants found the truck and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female, were healthy and sound, the authorities announced.
But Bunny and Peter, the courages Rickard and Peek had planned to show at regional competitions this week, for the sake of the owners of Japanese dogs, were carried away until their discovery on Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the National Long Beach "AKC/Eukanuba" Championship, where they wanted to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions of other tests scheduled in the days prior to the exhibition "AKC/Eukanuba", Peek said in the Times of Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops of the canine exhibition tour for almost a month from the couple.
Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often stay in the motels and get their truck outside, right next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs - a boxer chiot, a Parson Russell and a Breton Spaniard - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, the thickest fur, in the truck where it would be cooler.
They have a little open windows so the dogs can have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the truck flight at 6 p.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to corgas, with a micropike implanted to identify them.
It is not clear whether a reward was granted on Thursday.
The lion is ready to rot again, the restructuring of MGM waits no longer than the final green fire of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green fire to start again at zero.
A federal judge for the New York bankruptcys officially rented the "pre-packaged" plan on Thursday by creditors that would wipe out about $5 billion of debt; opening the way for the entertainment company, 86 years of existence, to focus its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television broadcasts.
With Thursday's decision that the plan meets the requirements of the United States Failure Code, there is no legal obstacle to MGM to return to the fleet under the supervision of the founders of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the general directors of what will be an alleviated studio.
Staff will be brought back to approximately 320 out of 400 at the start.
MGM will not really emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase has concluded a $500 million credit facility to finance new MGM operations and productions.
It is currently licensed by the Investment Bank, which itself amounts to $75 million, and should be financed by mid-December.
The studio restructuring process started in May 2009 when the Moelis & Co. investment bank was engaged to advise management on how to place its finances because it did not have the means to pay interest of $300 million a year.
In August, Director General Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, an ex-PDG from Enron, and a well-known expert for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's efforts to solve MGM's financial difficulties and meet the more than 140 studio creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to sell the company.
However, the sale of tenders attracted few bidders, none of whom were willing to pay the sum of 2 billion more, of which the creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, the MGM team had begun to work on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal disagreements and debates, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially resigns in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a multi-million-dollar premium for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already earned $1.2 million, will receive a $9.5 million payment.
Cooper companies, which have collected $375 000 per month for their corporate management services, will receive a $4 million "success grant".
Barber and Birnbaum intend to relaunch the production of MGM, which left only one film this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films that would come out from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "the Hobbit", with Warner Bros
The studio must conclude a separate loan between $265,000,000 and $275 million to finance its share in these two films, which must be made by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who holds about 18% of MGM's debt, attempted to make a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the principal shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies did not reach an agreement.
Tech Toys to maintain your balance gift budget
Although the main candidate for this year's most wonderful toy is IPAD, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft's video game system, Kinect, both can make an important break in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes at $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 strings to jump classic beads, or about 48 Play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy vendors - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and Fullesale Club of BJ - to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that Moore's Law has evolved, this year's technological toy is likely to have more force; however, the same price is less expensive than it was last year.
In addition, while there are usually fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the most famous of these, Webkins and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button stack toys are increasing, as well as rechargeable stack toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and more) are toys in the shell of the size of a Indian cock that sing a note when you press them on your belly.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second allows a song to be composed.
If you buy more, they'll sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you start to support, you can no longer stop.
To combine the song with the dance, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and more) is the best choice.
Based on Elmo Live's technology last year, the 14-inch animated doll plays role-playing games like Simon Says and can make the moon dance thanks to its innovative joints with wheel block.
Children who have tried the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain about a lack of volume control.
If you are a child in the 1980s, you will remember Alpha, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and more), with a back bag full of questionnaire game cards designed to turn a car ballad into a session with a self-correction and a van class.
If you are suspicious when your child holds your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for 3 to 8 years) is the least expensive and easier to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games do not teach as effectively as the Leafster Explorer ($70, for 3 to 12 years), it is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a more recent and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, for 3-7 years) uses an iTunes type system to offer games and electronic books and has an entry for SD card that allows you to display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and over) is a set of five blocks to hardly exceed one light box, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing the blocks online before time runs out, it is ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
Increasingly, toys have a kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in the toys stores, the two largest are Webkins and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet from the Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6-12 years) which includes a piece marked with a hidden code.
When you buy the online code, your child receives enough credit at the Penguin Club store for two items of choice.
It can be roller skates or a pet Puffle toy.
A little bigger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($ 10, for 5 years and more) is the last button-pillar micro-robot.
The false beast moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone pastes in random directions.
It's fun to make a labyrinth of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also solid.
Ours resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage into the mouth of our dog.
Bring a smoother side to maintain order in China
Tang Shenbin owned a place in the city as a city sergeant in training by seriously inspecting his nerves, issuing low-voice orders with a military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chenguan - who are in charge of the public order in China, afraid and despised for their arbitrary repression and their penance for violence - to convey a certain impression to a group of spectators.
"You're right!"
"You're a lot of people!"
Show them, he says, "What do beautiful girls look like?"
Four girls who had barely passed adolescence in white gloves, clothes and identical olive-colored pants, were on guard.
Four pairs of black heeled shoes, aligned to the rule.
Four perfectly treated hats lost to the top of hair attached by a reddish-blue and white knot.
"Personally, I think they have an average appearance," said Mr. Tang, with a deep look.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to refresh China's image of urban inspectors.
One city demanded that all new recruits have a higher degree.
The Guangdong province exchanged the grey-green uniforms against a so-called more promising blue.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced them with a strong eyebrow: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack truck with black eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the co-operator returned his business and left.
Xindu, a city district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose to do a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its street police in the urban environment of 13 women, especially chosen for their appearance, glove and youth.
The idea is to give the police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson might have trouble drawing attention to this underground urban brigade of China.
And for that reason, the critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to comply with municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But Chinese media spread news of a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the province of Hubei killed an observer after using his mobile phone to film them while spreading a protest against a waste shipment.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, torn down and put online, describes how to effectively defeat criminals without blood.
This year in Shanghai, a pasteur was abandoned with a brain injury after a trunk with five officers.
A video game featuring violence, available on-line download, shows Chinese inspectors trained to attack street vendors.
"Chenguan marked the government," lamented China Daily last year, a national publication, after a first debate on tactics.
The newspaper demanded a "real complete cleaning."
Skeptics say the approach is far away.
After the district went through an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered whether women had real jobs or were just a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district's announcement required female candidates between 18 and 22 years of age to have a beautiful silhouette and "five features of the face in the right order."
They must have a size above average of 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at 26 years of age is compulsory.
Officials stated that work was physically too painful for women over 25 years of age.
"It's their image that's important," said a certain district officer at Rednet.com, a quasi-governmental website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they are appropriate; it is size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament and the "internal qualities."
Chengguan women are like flower vases, he said, adding: "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Director of the City District Management Office, does not join this description.
However, he noted that the height requirements were the standard standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the order of the face.
That this means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, persons with disabilities or disabled persons should not apply.
"We can't leave a person boxing or a boss coming to serve here," said Mr. Zheng.
"He wouldn't give a good picture."
Liu Yi, who patrols the place Baoguang near a monastery, is 22 years old and has the pampered games with a finely curved mouth.
She does not consider the development of her appearance as a sexist, she says.
"Do you think I have the sexy air in this uniform?" she asked for an unscathed air.
Xu Yang, a 21-year-old fossilist, says, "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They did not oppose the restriction of their mandate, they said, because they were eating more career ambitions than simply chasing sellers in the streets where they were supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team faces dozens of traveling merchants who move quickly on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as many small breads or tofu balls as possible before taking the escape.
"Master Wang, you must leave."
"We've already told you several times!" said Mrs. Xu while a salesman ran away, temporarily abandoning his bicycle-cart.
Agents describe their functions as monotonous rather than burned.
"It's almost the same thing every day," said Huang Jing, 20-year-old, who studies post-work marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the goods of the sellers.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their superior men.
This tends to protect them from sudden public exhibitions of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, rebelled after the spread of false rumors that Chengguan agents had killed a seller.
On one night, more than a dozen policemen and gang members were injured, 14 government vehicles were turned on or on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But peace is not guaranteed.
Just two pasta of houses in the place Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled this morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
The agents seized a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as the regulations impose.
The owner of the bike created the scandal.
A 15-minute iron arm followed before the policemen, in the face of the disaster, broke a knife-to-car route to their vehicle and left at any speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40 years old, a coordinator attached to the male team, remained behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
Like female officers, 40-year-old or older coordinators are purely supportive.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a curious image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," says Mr. Li knows of a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, it's the public that starts."
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the Department of Justice raised criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, arising from a case involving an assistant of an old campaign and his efforts to obtain a lobbying job for the wife's husband, announced on Wednesday the senator's lawyers.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Republican of Nevada, who was considered as a potential Republican candidate for the 2012 presidency until the scandal surrounding his case did not make the big national titles last year and hurt his career.
Mr. Ensign's office stated that he was "very happy" with the decision, as a result of a one-year investigation.
The senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers stated that the Department of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he did not intend to maintain any charges against him in this case."
The Ministry of Justice abstained from commenting on this.
The announcement came as a kind of surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice, according to which there would be significant evidence indicating that Mr. Ensign would have conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first released in October 2009 in the New York Times, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to get a lucrative lobbying job to win the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, on the Senator's case with her.
Mrs. Hampton once served as a treasurer during an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funders to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to do lobbying for them; in accordance with documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was banned for a year by the law from lobbying with his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
Ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seems to be in contradiction with the ban on the rotating lobbying door.
According to the evidence that has been made public, "there appears to be prima facie evidence of a plot to violate and substantially violate the rotating door law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients from a government investigation.
Although the judge of the Department refused to explain the reasoning leading to the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the Department seemed to be disillusioned with political prosecutions after a number of high-level coups by its public integrity section, including the last year's decision to abandon the prosecutions against former Senator Ted Stevens accused of misconduct.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid of taking up arms, Melanie Sloan, the Director General of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defence group that received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, chief lawyer of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a telephone call Monday from a prosecutor of the Department of Justice and a follow-up the following day, saying that the department was not looking for charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's counsel team had cooperated with the prosecutors to try to convince them that the senator, as his office had reaffirmed on Wednesday in a statement, had "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to state the legal arguments he had made in the prosecutor's office.
"I'm not comfortable going into the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except to say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to abandon an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that the payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents to Hampton violated federal electoral law.
The electoral committee stated that it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was all except a gift.
NV Energy, an important company in Nevada that has long supported the senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that after the company received Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's cabinet chief John Lopez communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he "martled" the interior department on a dispute issue.
Mr. Ensign also participated in a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another client of Nevada, Allegiant Air, and he asked the Transport Secretary to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Mr. Hampton to do lobbying.
When the news of the case surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his position to lead the fourth republican Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign stated two weeks ago that he intended to provide a third mandate to the Senate.
By announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said that the senator hoped that the ethics committee would follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and put an end to his investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she said.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were typing away in the ranks of the audience room.
They sent every minute of horrible testimony reports via Twitter.
Finally, the defense said that there were more than 140,000 messages on the rape proceedings and children attached to their bed in a house that had been burned.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was found guilty of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family, in Connecticut, should result in an official end where the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed elements to the court that are beyond the scope of appeal, which can be held in court for years.
What is causing is that intense reports on the trial - as well as widespread and widespread use by Twitter journalists - have created a "circuit atmosphere", so widespread and instant saturation with fire details that the jury has been badly influenced by the public's passions.
The request could lead the appeals judges to discuss whether new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
"I have experienced this during this trial; I think there is a real danger that the introduction of new technologies in the courtrooms would violate the rights of the person to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, Mr. Hayes' lawyer, chief lawyer.
The trial judge, Jon C. Bleue of the Supreme Court of State, finally rejected the claims made last week, claiming that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury would have been animated by passion.
But this does not seem to be the last word on the issue.
For decades, appeals have acknowledged that the media coverage of known cases may raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a 1966 judgment that was issued, the Supreme Court of the United States annulled the conviction of an osteopathy in Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, supporting in his decision that there was a "carnival atmosphere at the trial " due to the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for television broadcasting and the movie "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers have stated that the appeal courts filed to review Mr. Hayes' conviction a half century later may be curious given the argument that new rules might be needed to manage the media of the hearing rooms, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of the new media" in large trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford's Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that she was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue said that some appeals judges might be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of instant communication from the hearing rooms could allow more fair trials.
The Twitter case is just one of many others described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, which is likely to be discussed for years, which delays execution.
Defence lawyers also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered injury when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jury members by showing them macabre photos of criminal scenes when selecting the jury.
Some jury members said they had been horrified by the victim's photos, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and his daughters, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old.
The defence lawyers argue that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge unjustly expelled one of the jury, who had been criticised by the prosecutors, and that he has abused the verdict by making the unusual decision to bring the jury to a decision on a weekend.
The jury was not kidnapped.
But their arguments on the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by candidates at the Governor's office and the United States Senate.
They maintained that the computer media kept waiting for the flames of the emotion of the case.
"The daily budget of media tweets, cameras and journalists in front of the courthouse," the lawyers wrote, "did not look like anything that had been seen before here in New Haven, and perhaps even at the national level."
Their focus on covering the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists said that the statement that the new instantaneouss were more fiery than those reported earlier was a ludicrous view that would undermine the policy of the Court governing the media coverage of future proceedings.
However, some lawyers said that appeals were often attracted by the arguments that social and technological changes required court adaptation.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their case, they refer to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 that had reversed Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the media coverage of the trial and stated that they would invoke the need for new rules for the new media.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civilisation bring the clavicles closer together?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativeness, a minimum of civility broke out in Washington this week.
Is this a pre-currency sign of genuine bilateral cooperation or an illustrative moment before the rapid return to the partisan struggle in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the leaders of Congress has produced no progress on the major issues to be addressed during the session of the "box canard".
But of course, there was at least a poly discussion about the differences between the two parties and the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to mark points.
The Commission's public meeting on Wednesday on the President's deficit was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain among the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction for several months has created mutual respect transcending the ideological gap; but who still divides the members.
It is hardly enough to say that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both parties are now in a period of mutual testing and testing to obtain signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limitations of the public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed party war.
That is why the meeting on Tuesday and the subsequent comments of the participants revealed a minimum of claims or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
In terms of taxation, expenditure, health care or rights, both parties remain thousands of miles away.
However, the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed on the tone," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now next to the Ethics and Public Policy Centre.
"It's inevitable after the elections.
The elections sparked partial passions and then they sparked.
That's good."
On certain issues, including those on the agenda of the session of the House Canard, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and nobody is in favour of that.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve a part or a whole, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise is envisaged for the extension of unemployment benefits, because Republicans cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich, while refusing unemployment benefits for the unemployed.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, more optimism is planned on a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on the "box canard", with the ratification of the "New START" pact.
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institute, warned that successful cooperation on the most pressing problems of the Lame Duck session would not necessarily lead to a better agreement between the two parties when the 112th Congress met in January.
Instead, he said, a period of disagreement is likely, or inevitable.
"When things have to be done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared skepticism that civilization would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I consider most of what is going on between today and 2012 as a pre-show or shadow boxing compared to the main event in 2012, he said.
The reasons for this are closely related to the composition of the new republican majority in the House and the electors present in the tea that contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers of going too far, they know that they must try to be up to their promises to reduce public spending and repeal the new Health Care Act.
These partisan positions are now and are already clear in the initial responses to the recommendations of the deficit committee, which include reforming the tax code and increasing certain taxes, retiring the retirement age and reducing expenditure.
Co-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, according to themselves, have imposed the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes to the committee, composed of 18 members, to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they have had difficulty reaching that number.
The largest resistance remains among the group's electors; this suggests that there are tax issues, at least today, few reasons or willingness to compromise.
Galston foresees two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans of Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partial confrontations, given that the Republicans dispute Obama's budget, taxes and health care; then it will be followed by a period of greater bilateral cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
Public opinion.
It is widely demonstrated that, despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see both parties work together.
If the confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the public's reaction.
The person who will be judged to be lost will have to change his mind and find compromises.
But that would be an optimistic point of view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans of Congress than there was then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the militants of the two parties see 2010 as a simple prelude to a more consistent election in 2012.
In view of this reality, the civilization exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But much more effort will be required on the part of both sides to find a place of understanding on issues that still divide them.
Publicized U.S. documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The city's control is between the hands of a "Kleptocratie" and brings to Kremlin a piece of the wine pot and the protection money it collects, the US Embassy in Russia reported in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service carry out huge rockets that help explain the high cost of life in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate companies but also from organised criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical power" - takes part while the money goes to the top of the scale.
The service note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by Wikileaks on his website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been exported.
It was written while Iouri Loujkov was still mayor of Moscow; and he is largely responsible for corruption.
He was released in October by President Dmitri Medvedev, but since then there have been few cleaning traces.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who has a leading construction company, have always denied corruption charges over the years; and he has won several defamation proceedings on these charges.
In September, he stated what followed to a Russian television channel, when he was interrogated on a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's throwing, it's anything."
The Russians believe, to an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information in an ambassadorial record; and it is strange to realize that it would be for diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the Moscow City government and crime has led some people to appoint "disfunctioning" and to claim that the government was more functioning as a kleptocracy than a government," according to the Embassy's note.
" Criminal elements enjoy a " krysha " (the term used in the criminal world/mafia that literally means " roof " or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the Office of the Prosecutor, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the Moscow City Government.
"The analysts identify a three-level structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the summit."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militia are at second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill a gap in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB hits the money of the biggest companies and that the police target the small ones.
One source, he said, "explained that Moscow's business owners understood that it was preferable to obtain the protection of the MVD and the FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because, not only, they have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups, but they are also protected by law."
"That's why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer high."
The note notes that, although the collection of money is extended, protection itself may be unequal; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay quickly see their affairs closed under one pretext or another.
Medvedev has mentioned the fight against corruption several times, but he has made little progress.
The ambassador's note transmits reports of men carrying suitcases, probably filled with money, to Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on bureaucrats," said Gueorgui Satarov, director of Moscow's Think Tank Indem.
"But it's part of this bureaucracy."
"He is not part of a political class because he does not exist in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to Indem, the cost of corruption would be more than $300 billion a year at Russia's level.
The country has been classified 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are classified at least as corrupt).
The disclosure of the note by the US Embassy, which was realized only yesterday late in the evening, at Moscow's time, will certainly leave some dissatisfaction within the Russian government; although Loujkov may be blamed, to some extent, for the failures of Moscow, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that he is in the process of solving the problem.
Interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin raised the assumption that WikiLeaks' documents could be a manufacturing and reacted with anger at the statements that U.S. diplomats had disclosed by calling Batman and approaching Medvedev from Robin.
"The problem is that this is our interaction, an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we did not suspect that this would be achieved with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics."
The former Khmer Red Fighters forced to face the past
In a poorly illuminated classroom with concrete walls of poor quality, Anlong Veng, the principal of the secondary school, mentioned the man who had built it, the last head of the red Khmer, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves your Mok."
"He was a good leader; and he cared about his people," said Sring Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Known as "the mouth" for its brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Red, this commander remains popular in this isolated base of former Khmer Red in northwest Cambodia where he has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Reds went to the government, the long-term loyalty was finally called into question in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum of truth and reconciliation enabled victims to face up to the regime in public.
In June, the government distributed a high school manual that for the first time teaches the story of the Khmer Red to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly run with the United Nations, issued its first sentence on a former member of the Khmer Red, condemning, at 35 years of prison, the former head of the notorious torture centre of Tuol Slang, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch".
In view of this change in the situation, anxiety has increased among the former Khmer Red fighters of Anlong Veng, complicated by reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There are feelings and fear among the former Khmer Reds, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent agency that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Red Khmer was glorious, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within families."
Under the rule of the Khmer Reds in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or were killed by hunger, disease or overcrowding.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrowed the government of Pol Pot-U.S. in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last of the movements took place in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary were running the gerilla of their base in the mountains of West Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a follow-up to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a United Nations-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Red Khmer combatants began to damage the government, culminating in the capitalisations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had taken the lead, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006.
Without their benefactors, most of the former Red Khmer combatants were covered in black poverty, common in rural Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic in the movement.
Although some red Khmer elite officers kept their positions as local leaders in exchange for the possession of weapons, they are not qualified farmers at the low level.
"These people received very little follow-up after the capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are surrounded by the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime."
"They were raised in a context where business is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Red Khmers as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice grower.
"Life under the Khmer Red was good," he said.
"It's Mok feeding everyone."
But now life is difficult because we must meet our own needs."
The current Khmer court has also raised concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court should begin the trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former red Khmer minister.
The court's mandate is to judge the high leaders and the main perpetrators of the crimes, but he did not say whether he continued beyond those four cases.
It would take more to calm the fears of Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculations turned to Im Chaem, 64-year-old district chief in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the reign of the Red Khmers in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced workers would have found death.
Recently, during a torrenty evening, Im Chaem came back from work in the field near his wooden house on pilots, on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
While the sun was throwing long shadows on the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past in the red Khmers.
If the court summoned her, she said she would refuse to go.
"Cambodge is in peace and stability," she said.
"If there are more persecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who damaged the Khmer Red in 1978, also warned on several occasions that instability would occur if the court continued several suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
"Cambodge must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is all Cambodia has to do to move forward, says Youk Chhang, of the documentation center.
"Reconciliation in terms of Khmer is to reconnect broken pieces," he said.
"We have to put these pieces together so that we can understand."
The centre produced the first handbook approved by the government on the Red Khmers, "A history of the Democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history manuals of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Red.
As in most Cambodia, Anlong Veng youth know only a few details about the Khmer Red, despite the city's links to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, studying at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new manual helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he came home with the book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he said.
"They don't trust each other because they don't know exactly how many people the court will prosecute."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the manual and the court begin to have an impact, he said.
However, the Khmer Red retains a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the mountains of Dangrek, a road, invaded by the bad grasses, and packed with plastic bags, leads to a black-swift rectangle, covered with a rolled-table roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a tire stack after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31-year-old, a mobile phone salesman at the roadside, said she didn't know much about the man who was incinerated in this place.
"But he has a great spirit; and many people go there to pray," she said.
It was the anniversary of Noom Sothea and later that day she planned to walk to Pol Pot's last resting place where she would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope of bringing happiness.
Belarus agrees to renounce its military-quality uranium stock
The Government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it would abandon its highly enriched uranium stock, an essential component of nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide.
The agreement was disclosed in a joint communiqué published after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Sergei Martynov, in the margins of a security summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus to give up highly-rich uranium and seemed to have left the horizon last spring.
But US officials told Washington Post that certain classified operations have been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to eliminate 187 pounds of military-quality uranium from a Belarus research centre.
This opened the way to a Wednesday agreement to eliminate the remainder of the matter of approximately 500 pounds, according to a staff member who mentioned the condition of the anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, organized at the Obama initiative, where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was useful to provide an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the summit in 2012.
"I'm really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit Nuclear Security Summit."
"This proves to me that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a group promoting nuclear security.
Clinton has described the "very significant, important" agreement made by Belarus.
Obama committed itself in Prague in April 2009 to secure all nuclear materials that are vulnerable worldwide in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to rid themselves of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexandre Loukachenko said that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have kept high-rich uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military-quality uranium and low-enriched uranium," Mr. Loukachenko said.
"It's our product... we're not going to make salt bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We're going to use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, however, showing an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate Belarus's uranium, in October, was particularly complicated because the material had been slightly irradiated, said responsible.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles up to an installation in Russia to be stored and removed, indicated those responsible.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to those responsible.
The US government spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus's research facilities with low-rich uranium; inadequate for weapons.
"A detailed coordination and organization have been implemented to strengthen confidence", leading to Clinton's agreement, Andrew Bieniawski, a head of the Energy Department specializing in the Global Threat Reduction, said.
According to estimates from the James Martin Non-Proliferation Study Centre, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military-quality uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of the harsh repression by Loukachenko of Human Rights.
But the statement on Wednesday would suggest a new potential.
"All by welcoming progress on these issues of global security, the United States and Belarus have recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains essential for improving bilateral relations; and essential to the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The government has not objected to CIA flights
The government has not objected to the CIA's flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners in the direction of Guantanamo across the Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the US ambassador to Madrid.
This is demonstrated by documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, adding that the first Vice-President of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to "demonstrate that they exercise adequate surveillance over foreign aircraft crossing Spain".
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe that accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to dozens of countries, including Spain, there was a meeting between the former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report had "suddenly surprised the Government of Zapatero out of play" and stressed that Spain had nothing to hide.
"Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to flights of intelligence above the Spanish territory."
"They only want to be informed" to avoid being "taken away," says Aguirre in a cable.
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of that time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this case the lowest possible profile, even though, as it was in the hands of judges, the Government had limited influence".
In turn, in January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González told the Embassy that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Department of Defense on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no criminal elements, no sensitive information," the Embassy explained after speaking to the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the United States has shown concern about "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors" rather than about the classified information of the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between Governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007, during a lunch between the US Ambassador and the Minister of the Internet, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "although Spanish judges are bitterly jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments of a burning rhetoric, trying to lower the temperature".
The ambassador also expresses concern about PP's action in this matter.
"Despite its overall pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly benefit from any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those disclosures have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," she said.
The Pariside that passed on to the nuns complained in the network of the "accompaniment" of being a mother
The young girl was talking about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror to Galician"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With that nickname she used as soon as she was little, she communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two natives of Noia, the village of Coruña to which she originated.
The messages are dated 2008.
To hear them, you need to know his emotional life, which ABC builds with the help of his parents' testimony.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had started a relationship in 1998 with Iván Tunez, an industrial woman.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Shortly after they separated, we knew she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was with him, but his ex never let him do the DNA test.
We discovered another little friend shortly after that.
The election was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring town.
With him, she lived for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the young girl went to the Balearic Islands to investigate the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But according to the content of his communications, it is believed that their idol has broken, they have separated.
In March 2008 she was in Minorque alone, and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and seen for the fact that I came to work there."
"When I told him, it seemed good to him, but of course, he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day long and not have the freedom to do what he wants."
And then she's talking about a mobile message she just received: "I want you to come in this month or give me an address to send you the child."
She complains, "If he doesn't like it, he'll leave the boy with my mother, and I'll take it when I get back," she says.
In May, she spoke of the entrance to her village: "This week I am leaving, but I will only stay there until 19 because I have to present myself to a job to not lose it."
She explains that if everything was okay, she would have taken her elder with her.
"He will stay with the right person, i.e. with me, and I will never leave him from my life with another person if that person is not my mother," suspicious intention, taking into account their bad relationships.
In July, there was another post.
When she tapped it, it was assumed that the child, who had arrived on the island in 1 of this month, and he was allegedly murdered on 10, was dead.
"Cesar's happy on one side, but he's not happy on the other."
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes this place a little bit, but on the other hand he goes to school almost every day."
She's talking about moving to Majorque.
"There will be (the child) in a few hours of summer and like this I save some money from the baby-sitter."
On 17th, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss on Caesar's side, who asks me when it's time for you to come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to the e-mail, you see, when he wants to, he sees me, shit."
Another 30: "The child is good, he goes to summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Victor, his current partner, there is one: "He's ahead of me of money."
On the Internet she has messages in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of hers in the MySpace universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the prison liberator."
"Terreur à la Galician (epigraphe)".
The last man who lived with her, cautiously, said he felt sorry for feeling guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything happened because she didn't tell him that she was a single mother.
Monica joined the provincial penitentiary in Palma yesterday, from the centre of juvenile justice.
The officer's lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that she didn't remember how the events had happened, "and she didn't intend to hurt the minor anymore."
Before she had admitted to snooping Caesar in the bathroom and deposited her body in a suitcase.
The defence and the prosecutor have requested a psychiatric test.
Members of the Popular Party would gain 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in the votes and Members recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already referred to the generals because, whether there is progress or not, the prospects are more positive, because the number of votes that this training receives in these committees is normally double what it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the Catalan populace won 610,473 votes in the 2008 generals, while the 2006 autonomouss won 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC obtained 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend was maintained, with the desire for a vote-out of the PSC and the fidilization of the PP electorate, analysts calculated that, if there were general elections, the PSC could go from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CIU would also win four (now 10) and PSC would lose no more than 9 MPs (at 25).
These calculations would show that the Catalan place is fundamental to PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose a Member - he now has three - while ICV would keep a Member or win one.
But if the electoral agenda is held, the next meeting would take place in May 2011 for municipal commissions, where people can also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemony in the four capitals of the province and their relations with the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the highest budget - EUR 661 million for 2011-.
Both nationalists and populars agree that the PSC could lose the mayors of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not get the majority the opportunity to use their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the Republican debacle, it would not be fantastic for this training to lose its representation in the mayor of Barcelona - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes compared to PSC, whose mayor, Angel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met several times.
Populars have also made progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaida
In addition to the seven prisoners in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian police officers from the General Information Office of the Barcelona Police formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, provided passports to various Al Qaida groups, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Land of Tamil" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the latest author of the Bombay attacks that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has attached great importance to these investigations, in order to ensure that with "the Kampai operation" the Al Qaida falsification device has been "debilitated" at international level and "as a result, its operational capacity".
Researchers estimate that the cell, in the two years during which it was active in Catalonia, could send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that would integrate the Al Qaida criminal galaxy so that its "combatants" could cross European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network was operating in Europe, which is why, apart from Thai services, other European police units participated in the investigations, so there could be similar attacks in the European Union's territory on the following days as it did on Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Ashar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), another one was held in Thailand, with the capture of Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikalaya Kijbumrung.
They were those who led the cell in Spain and other European countries since Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - was mainly used by tourists to fly passports that met the conditions marked by the name of the World Islamic Front.
In other words, the documents were to be on behalf of young men aged 25 to 45, with a validity of several years and without printed visas.
Investigators point out that so far no details have been found connecting the prisoners in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, even though the author of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
However, it should be recalled that a few days before the attack was carried out, a transfer agency of several thousand dollars was sent from Catalonia to buy mobile cards that were used after the members of the commando that killed 106 people.
The police have found a lot of documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
The PPC leader, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Arthur Mas his conditions to support his investment as President of the Generalitat, identical to those exposed during the campaign and to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-sovereignistic adventures such as the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wants to address half of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan populace arrived at your meeting with Arthur Mas with the security that gave him 18 members in the elections last Sunday, a number more than enough to be loved, because the candidate of the UCI requires that at least one of the opposition's trainings abstain from the investment vote.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists wish to hold in Congress during the general elections, but, for the time being, the conversations that Mas has today with the rest of the political leaders are the key to Catalan.
And with regard to the President of the PP, to support an investment "all sovereign and independent speeches should be eliminated", and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergence leader wishes to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders share their stand to discredit the political apparatus of a very excessive autonomous administration and the elimination of the tax applied to successions and donations.
Details of the negotiations on the investment of Mas will be taken care of by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised a hard opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citizens) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric claims that the dead were not due to "the lack of measures"
The owners of the Olot Centre do not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
Geriatric officials La Caritat d'Olot (Gerone) gave a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least 11 older people whose responsibility he was at the time he worked there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, was accompanied by the Centre's lawyer, Joan Cañada and announced that "La Caritat's desire would be to be able to charge the responsible" for the dead, but "the legality and responsibility obliges us to assume the procedural situation of civil servants".
In addition to the social discreditation that the entity may suffer for failing to detect the criminal activities of the night nurse, the great threat to La Caritat is now taking the form of an important compensation that legal representatives of the victims' parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé said that the first crime date of August 2009 and that from that day on he never stopped killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatrics - who he suspected that in many cases no doctor would personally explore the deaths but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, categorically denied this situation yesterday and stated that "the lack of measures could at no time have been the cause of what happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "in this case there is only an indication of imprudentness on the part of any person other than the accused."
The person who was already baptized as the "Ange de la Mort" committed 11 murders earlier yesterday and details that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused death by injecting him with an insulin overdose, unlike the first crime he committed with a mixture of sedative pills.
The Director of La Caritat mentioned the complexity of controlling the access of the staff of the Centre to doctors.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktails had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in her desire to alleviate internal suffering, used to kill them.
But laboratory analyses will clarify whether Vila doesn't lie by saying that he's been looking for a less cruel death for his first victims, or rather he burned them inside, giving them a lessive as he's already agreed that he's done with the three women he killed in the 12-17 October period.
Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurse, nor the number of murders committed, nor do they eliminate the possibility that the number will be greater and justify their attitude by the various versions Vila made in her visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in changing the way she kills after successfully committing eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain available to justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threat
The investors suddenly responded yesterday to the Trichet yesterday's threat that "the markets must not underestimate our response capacity".
The differences between the devices are strong and the European banks' actions have increased by more than 5%.
However, we must no longer underestimate the ECB's ability to cheat, and the euro has barely recorded an increase, which is an interesting signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market which, in the same way as it collapses, recovers, but is motivated by closes of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB called on us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to withdraw for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank required the finalization of the public debt purchase plan due to its inefficiency and the elimination of all outstanding long-term liquidity measures, leaving only unlimited access per week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope to extend the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the sale of quarterly auctions to unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the bond purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent response of the markets yesterday and if they continue to be blind to withdraw the liquidity measures, which God helps us!
Just as during their meeting in May in which they claimed that they had not even planned to buy bonds and had broken the markets, the story might happen again tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new collapse on the market.
Yesterday's one-year deal in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5.28 per cent compared to 750 million to 4.81 per cent of the previous auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal have lowered 30 basic points throughout the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market feelings after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland the figures of the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole were published.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million in the short term and 15,000 potentials and have a deadline until February to obtain private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumed in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, on Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain the parliamentary approval of its new budget and it has not yet had sufficient support, so Ireland remains in a home of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech to relieve tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest of the hymn of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound like Vivaldi's four seasons.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange has suffered 4.5%, the double as the rest of the European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and radical and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a three-year commitment that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we hope that this will be resolved with a strong demand and help to dissipate doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to apply for a Plan of Assistance would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million in cash available, the triple compared to March, to very expensive types and they cut access to the day market.
However, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "other than being, the appearance".
Courage, we can get out of it!
The President of Eulen will challenge the council of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm doesn't stop in the open conflict within the Alvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Alvarez, the founder of the group, will contest him because he considers him "no law", El Enebro's court council the next 16, requested by five of his seven sons, in which they will try to force their majority and save themselves from the management bodies of the Bodegas Vega Sicilia firm.
David Alvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their fight for the control of a part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services for companies does not seem willing to give up in his dispute to be present in the management bodies of El Enebro.
It was excluded from its board of directors by five of its seven sons who were appointed administrators at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January this year whose dispute is recorded in the Register of Trade and Societies.
The El Enebro Judicial Council for the next 16, convened by the Magistrate Commercial Number 2 of Madrid, reopened the box of toners within the Alvarez family.
The appeal to the judge to set the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the assembly's convening.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is described by David Álvarez as a "despiteless appeal by the applicants to try his five sons, through a procedural argument, clearly deceiving the Law and abusing the law, to validate and correct the assembly radically void on January 18th", according to his official spokesman.
This argument will be the basis for a dispute once the assembly is in place, considering that it is "no full law".
The same protagonists, who remain discreetly silent, have already tried unsuccessfully to convene an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a real estate company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Alvarez's sons control 100% of the capital.
However, the founder of the service group seeks 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This case is the fundamental issue that the judge must decide after hearing on the application for a complaint for which there is not yet a reported date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
A software creates real-time car improvements.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed was marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a new hurdle that had just arrived, despite the upward path of the last seasons, last November, in the last phase of the championship, they all bet on Ferrari's triumph of Fernando Alonso.
Without diminishing the skill as a champion pilot, German Sebastian Vette, and the ability of the Renault engine that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 we talk about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the Siemens multinational company has put into Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
In reality, this is a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with very far-reaching objectives of high car competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool was used to create assembly chains for manufacturers from all over the world, power stations, high-precision instruments.
The aim is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before actually constructing it, thus avoiding the avoidable defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's cameras, Sukhoi's planes or Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the Siemens Industrial Division, explains that the use of this computer instrument in his Formula 1 factory allowed Red Bull to create and execute "in a short time, almost in real time", changes, changes and improvements detected during the race and test.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 harvests had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to vehicles each season.
In the Red Bull team today, 180 highly qualified young professionals are working, who are equipped with powerful computer equipment to analyze and design any changes to diseases.
Siemens’ leader explained that the PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all components of Red Bull’s diseases except for the engine, which is Renault’s sole responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can change from virtual reality of the simulator to reality within 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this lack of technological development, there is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit on each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has installed the high-tech plant to create and produce its bolides in a locality 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are limited.
Everything that's going on down there is considered "secret top."
Staff for this task have 580 people, including two pilots, the Vettel and Mark Webber champion.
The hero of Formula 1 of Red Bull, no doubt, is the recent Sebastian Vetell champion.
Among the huge technological resources that the energy drink brand has put into service its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and zero.
The plant's technology director Steve Nevey said five years ago that R+D progress in racing cars was 50% of the winnings and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology accounts for 85% of the success, while pilots contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey says that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by the computer, because "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 clean shops with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive shop in Barcelona in collaboration with its associate Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 trades between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte English.
The Vice-President of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the remand shop located on the Grand Vía de Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which she has worked for 30 years.
The North American Group prepared a plan to implement 200 brand points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish institutions.
The first openings were those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, the one of Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even though she agreed that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM personal systems has ensured that the philosophy for the installation of shops will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with the experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and deals with the design of the exclusive furniture of shops (with products that may be affected in an interactive way), which will hold an identical image in Europe.
In addition, HP covers the training of the staff of the institutions.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive trading network claims "to improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in the purchase, assistance, post-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona Store includes a space with a global pioneer program that addresses the potential problems of HP computer equipment in guarantee.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht, Holland.
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is specially designed for MPEs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," Helena Herrero said yesterday.
Sabadell bet on 'fly' a million customers to its rivers in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, Banco Sabadell's CEO, Jaime Guardiola, thinks that 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
In spite of this, it provides for a fragmentation of the margins of interest, which will be tried in part to compensate for increases in commissions and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to capture within three years a million special customers, his task to be accomplished.
Sabadell has found a way to operate over the next three years and has the ability to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will launch a new management plan in 2011 which will hold a three-year standby.
The objective, apart from surviving without the need to use public subsidies from FROB, is to gain a market share through the capture of one million new special customers - 700,000 if those who can get out of the bank are deducted - its great task is to do so, because so far the bank had spent more on SMEs and companies than the individual client.
This year he captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share to individuals is 3.5%, while in companies it is more than 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is productivity or austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, whose challenges will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks are currently reluctant to set goals and make them public, as the financial crisis has disrupted all plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell will, in fact, complete this year's Optima Director's Plan, established four years ago, even though the plan initially was for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for an additional year.
Customers who let the savings boxes escape will be their main target.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be a "hard and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, thinks that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is essential for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the passive war - which penalizes margins - reduces the price of risk premiums that banks and cash pay for its emissions to obtain liquidity already move to the credit price to compensate for the fall of margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a factor of credit pressure."
"We haven't closed the drone, but the differences are higher," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already ordered his network to limit the long-term credit and increase the price of the differentials - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He also said that the banking sector's trend now is "to increase commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
The management plan of Sabadell is based on organic growth even though, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not wrong that he ensures that in Spain "we will demand larger dimensions."
"Everything will move next year," he said.
He states that capital requirements are "greatly increasing" and that some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And he mentions that the FROB can replace the market in the capture of funds in the case of new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it has reduced the importance of some banks already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it is not possible to issue, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through rest, which reduces the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among the funds
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of mergers of savings funds and again insisted on the speed with which the sector is being restructured.
When the Spanish savings fund concentration process began, there were several entities that ensured that they were not going to participate in this first phase and that they were reserved for the second phase.
However, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Funds (ECCA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I think that most of the mergers have been made, it cannot be said that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, these are adjustments."
"Most have been fully accomplished; it is possible that instead of 17 to 13 or 14, all major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has also cooperated heavily in this operation," the leader said.
In the statements during a breakfast of the Aragón Association of Directors and Executives (AEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process takes place "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it takes place in the times set in the past, not now in business plans with the Bank of Spain," he emphatized.
"The passage of 45 cash with an average of 28,500 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million is an uneven process in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to conform to Basel," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of rather unhappily views on the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remind us that we must respect the deadline before the end of the year".
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday ensured that Spain has the most stringent financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world and has given people who doubt it a "lack of knowledge".
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can remain very calm" with the situation of financial entities and savings funds, a system that has begun a "very important" and "goes as fast as possible" concentration process.
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector was well aware of the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin chose to remain in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the Union as a whole.
Market tensions have led to a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new adjustment methods, ranging from tax reductions for SMEs, the regulation of private placement agencies or the abolition of 426 euros of unemployment assistance without professional contribution to the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joined in criticizing Chancellor Angela Merkel for his responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be noted that Merkel's position is not an error in its communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which shocks with that of keeping the former traditions of most of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate about the three possible outcomes of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary area.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, even though it now seems to be science fiction, with a very favourable opinion, almost 50% of the population.
The third, a new euro design, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to countries that violate them, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has long been defined, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first signal of differences between what Germany thought should be done (tax rigidity and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second time in the Central European country was when Merkel had difficulty extending the decision to save Greece.
Since then, it has been subjected to fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and public opinion were against Greece's withdrawal.
Finally, by the end of October, Merkel once again expressed a clear position by calling for the reform of the Union treaties to enable a country to be rescued and, at the same time, to force private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European because it has speeded up the Irish crisis and the rest.
But its proposal, although somewhat sweet, has been approved and, in the following months, we should attend the EU reform process that makes these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And she tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we cannot agree, from that date on, the former operation of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which countries that violate the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to declare themselves at the end of payments and, in this case, the private sector will also bear a portion of the costs.
Germany tells us that we need to follow a strict path of growth with high savings and investment rates, consumption moderation, productivity and competitiveness improvements and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
It's clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
This is not just about bringing the public deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What we're asking is much harder.
And what he must not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will bring us greater peace.
And that we know how to seize the opportunity we have been given, until spring 2013.
President Zapatero seems to have also heard it in this form and his dual statement (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with the big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticism, we have opened the way to the thesis that we need to order the house.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is here, and they don't seem to move it.
And among the possibilities we are considering, it cannot be excluded that we should abandon a monetary area that is too crowded from less serious countries.
And in this case, Germany will always be able to tell us that she had warned us.
Sports and fraud of the law
The Russians like Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate the ingenuity but not the will to escape a penalty.
In principle, the expulsion of two players from Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the 23 November match against Ajax in the Champions League has caused a lot of anxiety about the anti-sportive nature of such behavior and whether the two players should be punished by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before the match (which their team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost the time when they made mistakes to determine the arbitration to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and given that Real Madrid will end up being the leader of its group, the two players will execute the regulatory penalty during the next match of the Auxerre strike match and will be able to pass without cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee has sanctioned with two matches the team's coach José Mourinho and various economic amounts for the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in such circumstances as this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is based on ethos, unwritten but followed rules of this sport.
Part of the debate in the case is due to the fact that this was the case with a team of the Real Madrid entity (which in its hymn shows the noble and the honor and which on past occasions condemned its players for similar acts) and the orchestrated dramatization, it seems by Mourinho, who adds a further episode to his long history of historical and provocative technicians.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour is expressly prohibited by the regulation is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether such acts constitute a fraud of law; because they are acts which are in conformity with the sport regulation, but seem to be misleading.
The question is to examine the type of harm they cause to the sports spirit.
One of the assets that understand the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the adverse players, an aspect that with these actions has not been put at risk, i.e. there was no violent game.
Another of these assets to which the right game is alluded is to avoid that the team of players of the offenders enjoys unfairly the opposite team, which is not the case anymore.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of the players in Real Madrid is that it is not comfortable that it is normally characterized as fraud or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules has not been carried out in secret to try to avoid the sanction, but their action has precisely tried to be as obvious as possible to receive the punishment of the arbitrator.
They were waiting, and they willingly accepted the penalty.
Another issue is the type of advantage that offenders derive from the deliberate errors they have examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that we do not put ourselves in a competitive disadvantage situation and we do not get an advantage in the same match, because the result of the action obviously implies leaving their own team with fewer players.
And it's not a good strategy for the next match, not anymore, because the club couldn't rely on these players.
Of course, the advantage is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that can threaten their participation in a future game.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team could be eliminated all of a sudden and apart from that, with this action, players perform a penalty match and pass the second round of cards, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cards occurs with less than the first cycle.
So, recording the steps, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In the end, these actions are not contrary to the sport spirit, which makes it even part of the strategic decision-making that contributes to the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not act to avoid the application of the sanction (it would indeed be a clear case of fraud of the law),m otherwise they chose the moment when they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without playing the penalty or running away from it.
Even though the boundary between the genius and the fraud of the law is spread, on this occasion I think we have had a clear case of genius.
The controversy, it seems to me, appears because of two factors: there were two self-exposures and because of the way in which the directive was transmitted to provoke them.
The evil caused by these actions to the principles of sport is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in NCBs
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-funded celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the tower and the lottery, when December comes, the dinners also come back from groups before Christmas which continue to be the oxygen balloon for Barcelona’s restaurants and entertainment, but which, due to the crisis, have resulted in an offensive price adjusted to capture the majority customer: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinner or dinner, coincides with business men and associations in the interviewed sector.
To complete the complexity of the accounting, this year's calendar (as the night of Saint Sylvest falls on Friday) concentrated the applications in the week of December 13, as a result of an avalanche of dinner reservations for the peak days (17 and 17) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there have been many companies that have eliminated collective money for budgetary reasons.
To maintain tradition, many employees organize them by paying for their own pockets.
Whatever the situation, they all ask for battle prices, confirms the President of Gremi de Restauracción de Barcelona, Gaietà Farrás.
The employer's representative, now, is not reluctant to predict what the holidays will be this month.
"People think a lot before booking."
"They want to get out, but they pay a lot of attention to the prices," he says.
The case will go well "for those who give quality at good prices and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to come down a step with the crisis, so that the euro round has become majority in demand.
In a survey in various centres in the centre, there is a collapse of applications for the night of 17.
The Soteras Group states that there is a genuine boom of applications for this Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with full formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda, etc.), the speciality of the calendar was more anticipated, even from the beginning of November.
"We made it impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all costs of 19.95 to 30 euros," they said.
AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, Quu and a total of 23 rooms, remains optimistic after having detected a billing gap since the second half and good, although concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources from the group indicate that the 18 will also be hyperactive at the level of groups of friends celebrating the holidays in advance.
In their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, such as Catalan wine made according to the champagne method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies again invite their employees and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased slightly.
On behalf of the Fecasarm patronage (including entities such as the Barcelona Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment Association), its Vice-President, Enric Gomá, is confident in the possibility of starting to see the end of the tunnel and argues that the reservations are "animal", even though the customers "negotiate to the maximum".
That is true, the hope for the holidays has not fallen, regardless of who pays, he indicates.
Pakistan's nuclear programme is of great concern to the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country".
Wikileaks filters confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the US Embassy of Pakistan and the United States Department of State filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused by the Pakistan nuclear program in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and tasty details on the content of the conversations and thoughts of the US diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear security, instead of increasing, "grows" and that the Asian institution produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
The particularity of the Pakistan nuclear program - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are stored by components to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack - is one of the main causes of concern in Washington.
This is how Ambassador Anne W. Patterson, Pakistan, lists in a report prior to the visit of the former National Security Adviser, James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear installations in the territory under attack in the Taliban, the dispersion of nuclear materials with short noise and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials."
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the United States but also by Russia, as a proliferator and a reason for the maintenance of the guard.
"Pakistan has staff hiring with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear installations; given the decline in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear programmes or missiles," said expert Yuri Korolev, Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at a meeting with his American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by the Julian Assange portal is the ever-increasing cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high level of Pakistani nuclear arms production.
An embassies from the Embassy in May, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," argues: "Transparency is often nonexistent; aid offers remain unanswered or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence officer for South Asia, notes that "in spite of the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by the Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the responsible that "Pakistan Army must end with the tacit support of terrorist groups".
To the hunt of the chief of Wikileaks
Obama will be one of the top leaders in the anti-terrorist struggle to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol emits a red warning to follow the movements and locate Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complex labyrinth where it is difficult to have certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
In addition, this one is not new, unless it is dated 20 November.
And he has nothing to do with the latest filtration of more than four million diplomatic documents in the United States, but with the allegations of sexual abuse faced by the Australian in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' creative lawyer Mark Stephens ensures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange".
On 20th, the international police force based in Lyon, France, issued the order at Sweden's request, but did not make it public until yesterday, after receiving permission from the authorities of that country.
For example, the 188 Interpol countries received the indication to identify or locate Assange "to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot give the arrest order to an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanation, consider the red appeal to be a free way for arrest -- which the national police body has to carry out -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as in the case of Sweden and England, where it is thought that Assange is located.
The movement was angry with Assange's lawyers, who yesterday issued a letter denouncing the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks willing to respond by video-conference to Swedish authorities' questions.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of Stalin's security.
"This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," the missive complains.
While the world is looking for him - and in Australia his mother defends the innocence of his son -- Assange continues to be found in an unknown place, but he did not hide.
On Monday, he gave an indeterminate interview to the Director of Time through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of the Secretary of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that it has been responsible for giving orders to US graduates that they seek to the United Nations by violating the international treaties that the United States has signed, it should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described the application as "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not sure why the opinion of a guy with a website should interest us," he told CNN.
Obama himself has been responsible for the anti-terrorist struggle, Russell Travers, to prevent new leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's attempt to reduce the importance of Assange contrasts with the views expressed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will be chaired by the National Security Committee in the Lower Chamber from January, asked the Department of State to study the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate its funds and continue to provide contributions or assistance to any person".
Even further, Tom Flanagan, a Canadian President Stephen Harper's adviser, has come back to his statements after saying that Assange should be "killed".
"Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
One person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former Arkansas governor, and possibly a presidential candidate.
"The one in the Government who has filtered the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment," he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with eyelids of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet offers a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to resolve the first internal revolt within the ERC, without north due to the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his threat of resignation is not sufficient for the followers of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as his liar and that it cannot at all give him any trouble with other extinct currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new criticisms with eyelids that allow him to shield himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national councillors from ERC will be able to speak on its secrecy.
By ballots, not by raising your hand.
If the charodists want to transport a certain vote of punishment to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of the class wants to avoid the image of division and the one of submission to his person.
In several interviews he stated that he would not consider himself to be ratified with half of one vote, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "to Bulgaria" would not be good.
People close to Carod require the president to make his position available to the militant, a gesture that is not true when Puigcercós controls the maximum body between the congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to approve with the executive a road map until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document, which will be submitted by the management to the vote of the National Council on 18.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to schedule the convention for the fall of 2011, which the leaders consider to be a sure fact.
The leader of the ERC agreed that "polyphony" affects stability and that its goal is to ensure that once for all the organization is able to wash its family room linen.
In this line, the article that current advisor Josep Huguet signed in his blog is a symptom result.
Considered the ideology of Puigcercós, the owner of Innovacó thought that the leader would be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" it was as if it had been done.
And he lists five of them, two of which he highlights.
The first, "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the campaign, i.e., include new figures coming from the Carod sector.
The second can be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that liquid ERC once and for all the assembly as a operating mechanism.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes that enables congresses to be held through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this regard in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave convulsions commissioned the management to review the assembly model at a specific statutory reform conference.
This meeting remains incomplete, as the internal nightmare of recent years did not recommend addressing this issue.
Now, without critical sectors at the end, the time could be good to take it back and close it forever.
23 implemented in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO of the State of Mexico, a decrease of 4 cases was recorded compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to MILENIO of the State of Mexico.
Among the murders are those of three women and the discovery of two bodies cut off in the Valley of Mexico.
During the previous month of the year, 390 deaths were recorded in organized crime theory.
Among the cases is that of a body found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three shots of firearm and the blow of the head, except for the feet and hands attached with a cable.
The next day, the body of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the trunk of a abandoned vehicle in Mixtecas Street in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, the town of Naucalpan.
Very early on Thursday morning, on the fourth day, landowners operated jointly found a body with signs of torture and at least three fatal fires in the thorax, on the autopeist near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the sector that crosses the municipality of Villa Guerrero.
Near the body was found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
One day after Nezahualcóyotl a 50-year-old gentleman was murdered with eight blows of fire when he left his house to initiate the order collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-olds were killed by a blow of fire at the head each in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc colony, the municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the blow of fire in the front we found a man's body on a solitary path of Colonia El Naranjo and under the body we found a bullet shot of firearm 25.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Plaza Golondrina colony.
The bodies of emergency have carried out a thorough investigation of the rest of the body members, but they have not been found.
The residents of Tepotzotlán warned of the discovery of a body that was in Peña Colorado, the hands tied behind and the eyes bound.
The man had an injury caused by a blow of firearm in the nucleus.
In the middle of the month, two men were reported to have been executed in covers and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the municipality of Atizapán of Zaragoza, while two death alert messages were discovered with the victims.
One day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was wrapped in a black plastic bag with a message signed by L'Incorrigible.
On the 17th, enveloped in envelopes, two women were found in the Zoquiapan hamlet of the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the morning after it was located the body of a man in Huixquilucan who had been wrapped in a yellow and blue envelope, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, according to a message that his executors had left beside him.
In Ixtapaluca, with gunshots in the nucleus, we found the dead body of a woman in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
On the woman's skin, we detected Santa Muerte's tattoos and necklaces with her image.
By the end of the month, the body of a man was found on the side of a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullet impacts and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with the head of the year and a message were found in the community of Piedra Bridge, Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said, "This is what happens to those who do not align themselves."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and with hands and feet attached, two bodies were found within a taxi abandoned behind the Centre of Justice of the San Agustín colony.
The last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcoyotl.
The first of them had been decapitated in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, attached with a canal tap and a message next to them; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Near him, the officers found a vest with a message.
China maintains its targets for reducing greenhouse gases
The representative of the country in COP16 assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed that it maintained its bid to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 45 per cent by 2020.
China maintains its bid to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020, provided Su Wei, a representative of that country, to COP16.
In its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei ensured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and convert its industry.
In fact, he reported that his country had invested $245 million over the last four years in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nevertheless, he made it clear that China would not change its objectives, but would continue to work with the international community in this area.
He mentioned that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity-building; institution-building; and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all of these areas, including the adoption, last year, of a new Energy Act, which recognizes the targets for greenhouse gas reduction.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with governments and locals to achieve energy saving targets, efficient use of energy and emission reduction.
Furthermore, it stated that there are various multi-year plans under way or completed, both funded by the Chinese government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented over the past five years and has received investment from the United Nations (United Nations), the Government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the change of lighting lamps by economic lamps and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific adviser to the Government of China on climate change, ensured that China's efforts were greater than we thought.
For example, it showed that per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are three tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 per cent of the historical contribution to pollution.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% over the past five years and plan to do something similar by 2020, he said.
Legal expulsion of Espino: Caesar Nava
The national leader of PAN said that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
National PAN leader César Nava Vázquez has ensured that Manuel Espino Barrientos' expulsion has been legal and that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
In his previous interview with Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case, the expulsion of Espino was a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr Espino has the right to address, where appropriate, a complaint to the National Council Order Commission, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he made it clear that this is not the time to think about 2012 and that there has never been an alliance for presidential candidacy on the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez declared himself convinced that Action National would be stronger after the internal elections of 4 and 5 December, where a successor should be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the time being, it has been an approach to the local elections that has succeeded and has reached its goal," he said.
The Panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition doesn't scare us; on the contrary, "we smell it and make us stronger," he said.
He said that the council would no doubt elect the best leader(s) that Action National needs for the next three years, so he would give the footnote "to the person determined by the council."
"I'm completely quiet and open, I'd be proud to leave the party's president office to any of the five."
He predicted that the resumption of the party in the elections last July 4 will be reflected in the next debate, even though "it is not yet the time to think about 2012."
"For the time being, it is to accompany Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emerge from the alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a cause for observation throughout the country, so that there was "a lot of hope for them, and I am sure Gabino will be at the height of expectations".
When criticisms of PRI against President Felipe Calderón were asked because of his speech during his four years of government, César Nava asked the petitioners to reflect on the six years of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas of Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas were better than those of Fox y Calderón; that they begin to defend them; that they come out of 'armory'," he said.
He stated that the holder of the Federal Executive may make such expressions as those made in his speech in the National Auditorium, because there is no banishment in the country, and less censorship.
Obama promotes on Twitter the law for paperless students
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitte told the American president in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today met with national mobilization to support the Dream Act, to legitimize undocumented students, with a message in his personal Twitter social network account.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitte Obama said.
His short message remains a cyber link with a broader document that requests the public to contact the senators immediately, as the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that we expect soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he said.
The message was released after the 42 republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the increase in taxes in the Bush era and the government's funding are prolonged.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START Treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned about the republican blocking of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs stated that he was confident that once the tax problem is solved, an agenda for the rest of the projects could be established.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we need to solve this tax problem before the end of the year..."
"I think we can reach an agreement at a given time in this regard and then we can plan the rest sequence," he said.
The Senate Democratic majority leader, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would ask for a "deployment vote" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legislate undocumented students could be voted on from Thursday in the Senate, although the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, they remained in that country for the last five years and were accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But the participants need 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they need the support of a large number of Republicans, at times when the party organizations of the protagonist project have an intense lobbying to ensure the approval of the Act.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska said he would vote against and only one Republican expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why the parties to the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most Courtesy Republicans are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who completed his term of office as Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, Texas, but they said they were not going to support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his position so far.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the biggest obstacles to the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With literature we put the finger on the wound
The second stage of the Language Pleasures was a walk in which participants took up the narrative
"The sex in the tongue, I understand, but... the finger on the wound? what is expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Language Pleasures, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and which this time used the subheading of her question (for another time the round table was dedicated to the Sex in the language, she explained).
The finger on the wound "...we put it in the barn," gently launched the Argentine writer to the public, most of the young, who had gathered at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this moderate table by Marisol Shultz and to whom Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz defined after as a great story, with Luisa in first person as a protagonist seeking to know what the "place" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only tracks in the same narrative line.
From the infectionologist she is convinced: "patience is not my strength, it may be my wound".
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut his breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explains to him that the wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is actually opened, the symbolic is the scar."
The breathed protagonist was relieved and concluded: "On the wound I was only able to know that it is open in reality and that it does not exist," but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be very connected with them.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a resounding narrative entitled Eloge to the invention, where the wound finger is not named but is discovered at a given time.
With the touch of magical realism, he spoke of a famous unlucky man who touched clouds, returned people who had gone far away or repaired virtues that a lady had lost, a story that turned to speak next to America, the great news that had had its own chroniclers from the beginning, and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo as criticizing the excessive narratives of the winning captains.
"Cervants who invented all of us (the writers) laughed at false witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a way we would never have told the story of America with an imagination that was missing even from the dust."
However, he pointed out that "fools and liars have the best imagination" and here the reality converging with the lie, we no longer know which part of the narrative belongs to a band or other, where fiction reaches its apoge.
This is actually called the 'Traditional of Cervantes'.
"It's thanks to her legacy that we have what we're counting on."
In turn, author Mayra Montyero noted and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the FIL with its round table.
The Puerto Rican Cubans have given attention to the great scourge of social violence that their country is experiencing - and Latin America is sharing - brings about drug trafficking and trafficking disputes.
"I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs refer to a tacit commitment that is not of course premedicated," she said, after mentioning that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, who also stressed "it must be on the wound of the committed writer".
He considered that in a world that lives at a high speed also with regard to intellectual habits and the control of consciences that turn to the advantage of dogmatism, "after each claim there is a little no and behind each denial there is a little yes."
"To be masters of our own feelings and masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuance means many times to put a finger on the wound and disturb people who feel very comfortable thinking in caricature, in white and black, in established ideas and without nuance, and also disturb the powers that prefer a world in white and black," he said, inviting us to regain the sense of writing.
Romano in the hunting of his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three flaws in finals he had high and low in his career, but he was able to achieve three times the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are also two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, who find a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three flaws in finals, he had high and low in his career, but he was able to reach the decisive series three times, even though he has not so far put in the thousand and that is why this opportunity is very special for him.
Argentina ended up condolences with the sub-champion medal, it remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The holy strategy reached its first final as a coach in the Open 2002 Tournament, when it held Morelia's kidneys with which it lost with an overall result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the Close 2003 it also reached the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and it was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, Rubén once again suffered a reversal, because his team had made a match of 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the series of penalties he gained an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get the title and finally three of his players missed 11 meters and he suffered the jump to the result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two finals with the Red Diablos and one with Monterrey, his rival at the tournament, so he doesn't want to be the same, he tries to get rid of the evil to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, even if he claims that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, it's for a club, it's not for a passion that I have, and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," the driver commented when asked what his weaknesses would be in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the final, of which he assures him that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can keep is that until the referee whispers the final, we can't celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the last time, with two sentences to draw we were already ready to run and I think it's a lesson, before the end of the game we can't celebrate".
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he trusts his players: "We never try to get to the series of penalties, we try to end up in the regular time, but sometimes we just get ready, the previous tournament we have been prepared, unfortunately fate has made us a bad turn, sometimes it's emotions or anxiety to hold the title between our hands, hands have escaped, it has served us as a lesson for this finale and we hope that we don't get there any more."
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a sub-champion technician and to taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining the visa
People must go to the Visa Applicant Service Centres before interviewing them in the Consular Section; the cost of waiting will be reduced.
As of 10 January 2011, the procedure for the treatment of visas at the United States Embassy and consulates will change.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to present themselves to the Visa Applicant Service Centres (ASC) before their interview in the Consular Section.
The ASC staff will receive the applicant's biometric information, which will be revised by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new procedure will bring certain benefits to the applicants, including the following:
The total cost of handling the visa will be lower, no longer will it be necessary to make a payment to obtain a date, another payment for the treatment of the visa and another for the mail service to deliver the document.
The vacuum cleaner will make a unique payment that will cover all three services.
The current rate will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 in the case of visas on request (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for commercial and investor visas.
Persons wishing to renew their visas should not present themselves for an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only present themselves at the nearest ESC where they will present the documents and will be given their fingerprints.
Because biometric information will be taken into the ASC, applicants wishing for a second meeting to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra $26 service fee.

NASA will announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The United States Space Agency cited the press to present a discovery tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Administration of Aeronautics and Space (NASA) of the United States will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, an astrological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented in a press conference tomorrow, at 1:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington for astrobiology experts, the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When she quoted the press, NASA ensured that she would have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," which caused speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures like us and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if their living conditions were improved.
It seems to be talking about a microbe discovered at the bottom of the Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that was thought too dangerous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any case, the creature uses arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, this proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from what we know."
The space agency will communicate the true scope of the discoveries in the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiology Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturne's largest satellite), with the prospect that his chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Anti-block Anti-Spam PRD, PT, Convergence & Pattern
With reforms to the Organic Act of Congress, the arrival of 'bipartism' is possible.
The 60th was just when an opposition bloc led by the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patron Montalvo appeared in Congress, which declared itself independent and the four questions were one: the arrival of the 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patron Montalvo, 'tonnes' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, have they reiterated, the 'bipartism' is being initiated, because now there are two people, the same number of parties, who control Congress.
These four MPs, alongside Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Directorate chaired by PANist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these reforms institutionally constitute the political marginality of the PRI and PAN.
He said that the following days they would speak to the representatives of PAN and PRI to modify the scheme with political will and if they did not, they would be again served by the two parties and the opposing coalition would end in this way.
"To date (the opposing coalition) is what I look at, because we are excluded from any decision, they have not even the political reference to the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergencia, mentioned that there are coincidences with PRD, PT and Patron and that is why they form a plural group.
We cannot allow Congress, after being monopolistic, to be "duopolistic" now.
"It is not the spirit of the reform of the law that there is an eternal bipartism in Congress."
To begin with, this group starts with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues to make them more numerous, the Convergent said.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT, explained that the Congress has now become a 'butine' between two, making an allusion to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two."
Mr Montalvo asked to respect the person of the Member, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"That they do not leave us with dome agreements outside 5 which will probably be 9 Members, now at the five that we see, separated into different fractions, we have decided to join us to find a place in the negotiating table, that is the problem, that in the reform that they have done, that they have decided, that we are outside and that we do not agree with that reform."
$200 million more for "the supplier"
The Mairie de Mazatlán pays another check to the owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another check of about 200 miles of weight for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the Mairie.
With this, the amount paid this second semester to the owner of the electrical equipment company amounts to 1 million 200 miles of weight.
According to the municipality's transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was issued last November 16 for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in terms of "delivery accounts".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Community would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the State's Superior Audit to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, how many cheques will still be issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: on 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last on 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, according to the provisions of the Act when a company is questioned by ASE, in order to avoid other governments using its services, the Treasury has ensured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after 25 July Northwest had published a review of checks issued by Mairie to its suppliers, revealing that in March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennat of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipality paying Camacho Palazuelos has more than 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, including checks of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites must be maintained
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the bad conditions of the Sánchez Taboada round-point in Mazatlán.
After the collapse of a foreign tourist in a crossroads of the Sánchez Taboada Roundpoint, Mazatlán's tourist sector asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in bad conditions and design a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of Zone Dorada, recalled that they repeatedly requested that the image of the destination be taken care of and that new activities be replaced by others that the tourists find to be wrong.
He said that the bad state of the streets and sidewalks had been affected because tourists had just walked around and they saw the disorder and avoided close trade.
"The politicians don't know what it means to close a business one day and they don't know the luck we lose, and they didn't do the work for so long and without adequate planning."
Hotel José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the downfall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the Mairie.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and avoid that this happens again, how it does so, so it has a preventive interview and not just the correction," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area should be maintained, but as residents who deserve a clean place to live there, and Mary must change her strategy to maintain the city."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it depends not only on promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has the purity in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"They have not been given the attention they need, and this kind of fact underlines something that is famous for everyone, maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, under Secretary of Tourist Promotion, said the recovery of Mazatlán's tourist sites is urgent because they are not properly used and designing a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that must be put together with the municipality and be a priority for the city's up-to-date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Luckily Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and places that we should first order, clean and put on the line to make them attractive so that we can add them to the inventory we have to make the promotion of this destination."
IP requests results at Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CEC, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various challenges they face.
Mazatlán's business sector seeks a decent and free labour legislation between parties and the Government Executive, as Sinaloa is convulsed and faces major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th legislation was installed, consisting of seven political forces, 19 members of PRI, 13 of PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and one of VATEM, a total of 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that new members of the Government Congress is a clean and committed management with society and the various sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same party or paternism models do not repeat.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CEC, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various challenges they face.
"We hope that Members actually exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties, because the custom is that they make pacts to ensure their own interests and turn themselves into a carnival mask of the governors and leaders of parliamentary factions."
That is why I ask them to confirm their commitment to establish the necessary bridges that the current Governor is making progress.
"We will ensure that they do decent work and especially engaged with society and sectors because Sinaloa's people gave them their confidence in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Three Isles Hotel Association, considered that one of the major challenges of the 40 popular representatives was to push and add forces seeking the economic growth of the state, because the economic situation is now very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they boost economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will in some way stimulate job generation."
With regard to tourism, he asked that the new legislators give him the importance he had in the government budget to consolidate the Secretariat of Government Tourism.
"I understand that it is the second State Secretariat with a smaller budget and that it is incongruous as an important and generating economic activity of currency and investment and that it is directly competing with the agro-industry."
In addition to the need to classify resources for detonating tourist projects that help to provide security to the State and to update the Alcohol Act that previous legislation has not been able to resolve.
We're looking for a magic king.
Popups, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of Kings Mages will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, because their home is formed by no more than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will bring them the toys and clothes they so long for.
The family has a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live today because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us because my husband doesn't have work, but we sell mandarins and potatoes...and in the afternoon I go out with the "plebes" to sell in the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3 years old, wants a Barbie doll.
In turn, ten-year-old José Alfredo has long been aspiring to have a 'monster truck' and for his little brother Jesus, eight months, Cayeta suggests sized clothes for a year.
"He said to me (José Alfredo), 'I'd like to have this monster', but I said to him, 'We will see, my son', because it was very expensive', he recalls with sadness Cayetana.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11 years old, is 12 and Isaiah, 10 years old, is 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, is eight.
José Juan, aged 14, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of size five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help realize the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family you can participate in the On Search King Mage campaign, giving a toy or money to the North West reception.
14 drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Austria on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
Investigations took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used for drug production.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of haschich, of the money and equipment used for production were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson for Quebec Security.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including two of the alleged leaders of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
Arrested persons were to appear in the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of production of cannabis, possession for the purpose of traffic, plotting and stealing of services, among others.
These investigations took place following a long-term investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It is from the information received from the public that allowed us to carry out these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
Some 70 police officers from the regional survey module of the Estrie de la Súreté du Québec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphremagog Police Department participated in this police operation.
Hidden migration can continue without a problem
According to the Government, the Conservatives' bill, which should address the problem of hidden migrants' ships, is likely to be beaten while the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I strongly rely on the Charter."
"I stand with a party that has created the granite under your feet," said liberal chief Michael Ignatieff, while he was surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals claim that the proposed bill, which would allow up to one year of detention of any person from a ship identified as transporting clandestine immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also stated that he could not support the bill, because he took it to the wrong goal.
"We are against and it seems that all parties to the opposition are against, so we will see what the government will do," said Duceppe.
The NPD's immigration criticism, Olivia Chow, has rejected the back of the hand criticism that her party is not firm enough about clandestine immigrants.
"The neo-democrats agree to take action against clandestine passers-by, and that is what we do by means of another bill, the C-35," said Ms. Chow.
"We do not support the Conservatives' bill because it takes refugees and incarcerates children for at least one year," said Ms. Chow.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, accused the opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians say massively to MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country as a strawberry."
"They expect Canada to take firm measures," said Minister Kenny.
The Government did not announce a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to a vote of rejection.
One conservative, however, told the QMI Agency that the government would ask for a vote so that each opposition member would then explain himself to his or her electors.
The new unit does not make unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent unit to combat corruption and corruption by Jean Charest, many observers continue to request the establishment of a public investigation committee on the subject.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea does not date yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the New York Department of Research on this issue as of January last.
The metropolis has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, the announcement on Tuesday surprised more than one.
It should be said that at a permanent meeting of the Québec Police Services Council on 29 October, this action was never discussed despite Robert Dutil's presence.
It was no longer necessary for the pessimistic public security critic, Stéphane Bergeron, to call this announcement "a rabbit out of a hat" and a "bricoled solution on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil replied to those who feared that political power had too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You're going to see the result when we're going to announce it, he's just saying."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public investigation.
"The more Mr. Charest insists on not setting up this investigation committee, the more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is to resign Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this impasse, he therefore suggested that Quebec be given a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate corruption and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, enabling him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent shell is not the only project in the charters of the Charest government.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This would come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in this kind of investigation.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his fellow Justice colleague Rob Nicholson is currently considering some of the amendments relating to this matter.
During Operation Spring 2001, which hit the motorcycle groups, even though the Criminal Code had not been adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Act on gangsterism.
High-supervised rivers
Several watercourses remain under high surveillance due to heavy precipitation that has hit several regions of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide took place on Wednesday afternoon in Shawnigan, Mauritius.
Two houses have been evacuated in a preventive manner.
In the evening, another glimmer would have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
A road broke down.
From Tuesday evening to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall fell on several regions, from 40 to 70 mm of rain.
From 20 to 40 millimetres of additional rain were expected by Thursday evening, according to the regions.
The areas north of the river and in the Outauois Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to 100 mm of rain in total.
As these precipitations must be added to the already accumulated snow source in some sectors, several watercourses are feared.
Flood alerts were issued on Wednesday evening by the Québec Civil Security for the Rivers Oueau and the Achigan, in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, in St.Jerôme, in the Laurentides, and in the Chen, in Lotbinière, made them the subject of flood watch and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy precipitation caused the flooding of some lakes in Sainte-Juliane, Sainte-Marceline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was taken due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated on a preventive basis.
In Outaouais, the flooding of some lakes has led to the closure of several roads, including in the municipality of Mansfield- and Pontefract.
The Civil Security remains alerted and closely monitored, said Annik Bouchard, a Security Adviser.
The Quebec Crusade Forecast Centre has for its part issued Wednesday warnings of strong crusades for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batscan and the Loup.
Partially blamed dupont
Québec Radio Animator Stéphane Dupont has been partially reversed before the Canadian Council of Radio Television Standards (CCNR) for controversial discussions on social assistance and Haitians as well as on its wholesale wave language.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his team at CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but that some statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unrelenting negative representations of Haitians and gross language that were not suitable for broadcasts during the day".
The Council also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two persons who had committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints about comments made during the 2008-2010 broadcast.
The first decision was made as a result of a complaint from the Québec Joint Front of Assisted Social Persons.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the issue were incorrect.
Animators must provide solid information rather than misleading information.
With regard to suicide, animator Stéphane Dupont had considered suicide to be a gesture of release.
Most members of the Committee concluded that the vehicle message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of "Dupont the Midi" have dealt with a delicate topic in a fair and appropriate manner."
So no blame has been taken in his place.
The last dispute was about statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-Réné Dufort were then delivered to a media-faced who had caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI animator stated that he had made no donation to help the Haitians because it was not possible to know with certainty that the people who needed would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unfairly negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've already had my three-day suspension over there."
"My file has been a virgin for a year and a half," said the animator.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of gross language.
In each case, the CHOI-FM radio broadcaster collaborated "in addition to its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station, which will, among other things, have to announce these decisions once during hours of great listening within three days.
A king of kung fu in Montreal
The Montréal of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special course.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing climbs on the world's tatamisms and rings in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria, Zemmal explained, installed in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve among professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for fights a little everywhere, because for those who don't like the game on the ground in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the person who works as a security agent and as a commissioner for the UPS company just released bad news to its rivers, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) amateur World Championship from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the categories of kickboxing full contact and Thai box, he explained."
"Now, I'm getting ready to go to China for the World Cup of San Show."
"The combatants who ended up among the first four at the last World Championship in each category were invited."
"I won the bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I completed the fifth round, while I arrived third in Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What's interesting is that I've progressed to every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
The "san show" or "sanda" is a discipline from China where punches and kicks, as well as ground projections, are allowed.
Duels take place originally on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous pugilist from this form of combat is the Vietnamese American Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event in his career, he will certainly respond to his presence at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung fu.
"This competition is the most prominent and most prestigious in China," explained Gaillard.
"It's a bit of the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first battle, in half-final of his category (80 kg), before losing in the end.
"The one who beat me was a real pro, did he analyze."
"There are four combatants per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"Half-final winners face their category at the end."
"Then, the winners of each category face each other to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has granted $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium formed by BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor, which has obtained the most important, that of project management, for a sum of $295 million without tender.
This consortium called Energy Management was formed in 2004 in conjunction with Hydro-Québec's choice to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important 5 billion-dollar hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Management consortium broke down the profitable contract without public tendering.
For the Quebec Party, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that could eliminate competition and lead to an increase in prices.
"It's the new way to deal with confusion and reduce competition."
"That is, people, instead of doing it in secret, now do it in an open way," said Pakistani MP Sylvain Simard yesterday in a press conference.
Earlier this morning, Mr. Simard raised the question to the National Assembly because he said that it was difficult to see how the public interest could be used in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, firmly denying that there was a collapse in this contract.
"I'm starting to have my trip," she whispered, arguing that the PQ had been "dishonest" and had "lack of rigour".
She said "that would be the least of the things" that the PQ apologized for.
The consortium formula is a common practice around the world.
This is usually a limited alliance over time that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scope of the work.
The building is underway and has to be upgraded until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without the game of competition acting; there was negotiation.
Thus, the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week by Le Dedo, the consortium formula in the engineering sector is being investigated by the government.
A rapid survey of the Quebec business register allows for the number of more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
For example, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and even moral person, namely Dessau.
With regard to the Energy Management consortium, Minister Normandou stressed that "the territory of Baie James is responding to particular labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has been responding in particular since the 1970s".
The great patron of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Baie James Energy Society (SEBJ), has given an explanation that the project's management contract has been awarded on a voluntary basis.
"If you go to bids and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: whether you take the people who are in this market or you say: we're going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement with a good price."
"But the idea is that it is not the price that is important, that is the competence of people," said Mr Laporte.
This contract awarded to the Consortium Energy Management is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
Contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, The Devoir counted 109 engineering and advice contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has entered into 22 contracts, Genivar has obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, regardless of its participation in Energy Management.
All contracts were negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the contract in Energy management of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard said that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor) are "known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has agreed that the PQ is also linked to those firms that "finance it" before stating that it was rather its leaders.
Responsible consumption barometer - The label "green" does not inspire trust
Greener, but frankly sceptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in fair trade marks and environmental certifications to guide its choices.
Pis, although he swims in a media universe where messages in favour of more responsible consumption are pulsating, he regrets a lack of credible information, a lack of which he even describes as a brake to his commitment, indicates the Barometer of responsible consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Even though they increased the consumption of products socially responsible in 2010, the Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who are trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say that they do not believe in the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, reveal the measurement tool developed by the Observatory for Responsible Consumption at Sherbrooke University.
Another finding is that half of consumers doubt the reliability of the official certificates on the said products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that appear to be eco-responsible, says the Barometer.
In the same vein, the speech of politicians on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, information on responsible consumption seems to be essential to stimulate this currently animated consumption bread by nearly a third of Quebec's consumers.
Indeed, empty and suspicious information would calm the burning of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers say that they are also mistrustful about the alleged performance of green products or services they seek to put in their hands.
On another note, consumers were almost half-in 2010 to change their habit and, above all, to change the brand of one or more products in order to respond to their conviction.
At 61%, they also promoted purchases from retailers in their neighborhood and privileged the purchase of food grown in their region, says the Barometer.
More green and responsible - the index of responsible consumption has reached 64 of a maximum of 100 for this year - , the Home consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling seeking to reduce its environmental footprint by worrying about the protection of animals.
However, its social and environmental consciousness seems to remain outside its car, says the Barometer: in 2010, almost 28% of Quebecers indicated that they had used transport in common or had advocated co-driving to defend their green interests.
The walk and bike were also supported by 39.1% of the participants in this extensive behavioral survey, which has just taken its first click.
State loan for the purchase of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which was asked to commit financially to the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Angus and Parallel Society, agrees to cooperate, but only in competition with a loan.
The Angus Development Society and the Parallel, who were expecting a donation of $7 million from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex on the Saint Laurent boulevard by giving him his full kinephilic vocation, did not get what they claimed.
The government agrees to get involved in the case, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan that would be less than initial expectations, which could be a viable solution to favourable conditions, at least from the opinion of the State offices.
A first action plan and an application of 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have been reviewed at the end of the year.
A proposal and a plan of action were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Société de Développement des Entrepreneurs Culturales (SODEC), François Macerola, who pilots the eXcentris file.
He made him get a final report a decade ago.
But the counter-proposal of the cabinet reached SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallel and Angus have until 31 December to respond.
It seems, however, that the assumption of the gift of the State must really be avoided.
Let us recall that the Québec Film and Cinéparks Association opposed a direct investment by the State to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it has not done for other cinemas.
However, several environmental stakeholders claimed substantial economic aid.
For ten years, Daniel Langlois, the master of ceans, carried the author's cinema into his complex rooms after financing his own construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is screaming in Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to trust his clientele.
The Angus and Parallel Society, with their head Christian Yaccarini, are piloting a private funding campaign, hoping to collect $700,000 to push the acquisition wheel.
Since spring 2009, one of the three screens, Le Parallèle, has been broadcasting films to eXcentris.
The aim of future buyers is to reopen the three halls on February 27th by designing the very beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall The Devoir and we are unaware of what he and his group think of the proposals that have been made to them.
The veil lifted on a complex Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal the veil that the U.S. considers the Canadians' inferiority complex to the Americans, but at the same time betray the feeling of superiority to Canada.
Thus, American diplomats are surprised that every Canadian elector has no Canadian-American relationship in mind by voting and believe that President Obama's visit helped the conservative government to adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. embassy in Ottawa and Washington, located on the public square yesterday, offer more nuanced details than material content to be placed under the tooth.
A cable dated 22 September 2008, or in a federal electoral campaign, reported how far the United States was not part of the issues discussed by the political leaders.
To the great surprise of the US ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins gave some explanations to this situation.
"An almost inherently Canadian inferiority complex may require Canadian political leaders to talk about internal issues of the daily rather than make this election to the United States (as in the 1988 campaign on free trade), " he writes.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, "the elephant proverb of this election: it is omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to talk about it."
The ambassador understands at least this "absorbing silence" that both countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"It is logical that the ability of a candidate, a party and even more of a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind by voting."
The other expression of this importance is in the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, responsible for business in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's survival during the vote of confidence in the federal budget at the beginning of February, by which Canada will display its first deficit for more than a decade due to a relaunch plan of $30 to $40 billion," writes Mr. Breese.
There is no mention of the fact that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas in order to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that opposition parties would make their survival conditional on the quality of the proposed relaunch plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, prevents Washington from increasingly negatively depicting the drama series broadcast to CBC from returning to the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the Border, Little Moscow on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O broadcasts, in which there are little subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the removals for the CIA's muscle interrogations.
Another cable reported that, at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some of Guantanamo's prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner replied yes, but on the basis of the "case by case".
At the end of the meeting, it is written, "he sent a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Canadian Muslim."
"The secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we note that the minds are warming up about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a very close former adviser to Stephen Harper, said on the waves of CBC that the person responsible for this massive escape should be "killed".
Mike Huckabee's echo in the United States.
A Global Plan to Renovate Light
In Cancún yesterday, the United Nations proposed a plan for the renovation of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to achieve a greenhouse gas reduction (GHG) corresponding to almost a third of the additional reduction required to stabilise the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the wake of the great concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Cancún to compensate for the absence of binding reduction commitments by industrialized countries.
According to yesterday's plan, if incandescent ampoules still monopolizing from 50% to 70% of the market were replaced by fluo-compact ampoules or, better, by electroluminescent diode ampoules (DEL or "LED" in English), the essence of the 1.8 billion tonnes of GHG (Gt) emitted on the planet to shed light on humans would be avoided.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the planetary car park.
In Copenhagen, last year, major issuing countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that should lead to global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will have to be subtracted from this 5 Gt balance sheet to stabilize by 2020 the rise in climate to 2 degrees centigrades in order to avoid becoming out of control.
In the incandescent ampoules, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, or 5%, is produced by light.
With fluorinated ampoules, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with new ampoules in DEL, this need for energy is reduced twice again.
Fluo-Compact ampoules are averaged 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new DEL ampoules, like those launched by the Philips manufacturer this week - this company also participated in the United Nations study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent ampoule, which gives an idea of the economy possible with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
All these new ampoules can also work with reostats in addition to producing very little heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have posted reserves for fluorinated ampoules because they contain mercury and need to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless the manufacturers put in place signs.
But, says the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluocompact ampoule, but the coal thermal plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce spent electricity in incandescent ampoules.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the gains each country would make through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would thus save one billion dollars a year in electricity purchases and eight million tons of CO2 or the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire waits for the announcement of electoral results in nervousness
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, called for the publication of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire after the deadlines had expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and to announce the provisional results without delay, highlighted a spokesperson for the head of the United Nations."
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to demonstrate responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the announcement of provisional results."
Despite the pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission let the Wednesday afternoon butt date pass without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's vote.
About forty minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the President of the IEC had stated on television that the commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
The calls have multiplied in the world on Wednesday to finally declare the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp has been counting on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "fraud" votes in the north, held by the former Rebellion of the New Forces (FN) since the coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign director of the Ivorian President, said that the intimidation exercises of UN voters in the north of the country had deterred the party of the outgoing president to vote.
All elections could be cancelled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo were retained by the Constitutional Council.
But Gbagbo's opponents believe that the highest court in the country is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the North who breaks off all ties with the former rebels, considered the delay in the announcement of the results and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go until he claimed the victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that it would be illegal to complain to the Constitutional Council after preventing the electoral commission from disseminating the results.
The second round of the presidency, Sunday, was expected to co-ordinate the process of unification and reconciliation of one country in two years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished the first round on 31 October, with 38% of the vote against 32% in Alaskan Ouattara, which had received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédíé (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France at 3rd quarter
The unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the International Labour Office (ILO) remained stable at 9.3% in metropolis (9.7% in the overseas departments), showing the corrected data of the seasonal changes (CVS) published by Insee on Thursday.
The number of unemployed was 2,631 million in metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9.7% with the DOM.
In one year, the unemployment rate is displayed at an increase of 0.1 points.
More widely, 3.4 million people in Metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether they were available within the two weeks to work and whether they were looking for a job or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has further deteriorated, with a new increase in the unemployment rate, reaching 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% including DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637,000 15-24-year-olds were unemployed within the meaning of ITB.
For their part, seniors experienced a slight increase in unemployment, at 6.4% in metropolis (+0.2 points over three months and over one year), or 482,000 people aged 50 or over, and 6.6% with DOMs.
Only 25-49 years of age benefited from stability of unemployment in the third quarter, at 8.3% in metropolis (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
The Insee no longer publishes monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a debate on its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (GDP included) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini was examined and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, head of waste treatment companies and the President of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, PS President, was examined and destroyed at the Luynes House of Detention, near Aix-en-Provence in an investigation into alleged fraudulent public markets.
Alexandre Guérini has been examined for abuse of social property, misappropriation of funds and public property, relic, active corruption, trafficking in influence and possession of ammunition, says his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is combative and wants to explain all the questions the magistrate will ask him, not ghosts."
"It's easy to pursue it for a lot of reprehensible leaders, it's another thing to prove it," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told the AFP before his client's hearing.
Mr. Guerini, a brother of the strong man of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guerini, had, through his lawyers, asked the judge to send a memo before his hearing to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also examined on Wednesday night and crushed.
According to his lawyer, Me Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything but make the downloads he had to manage.
As to the award of the contracts or the allocation of the funds related to their operation, he had never known, Mr Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Aubagne Assembly Services, was examined on Wednesday for the diversion of public and complicated funds, and released under judicial control with a ban on meeting the file's protagonists.
"My client has been able to provide explanations to the facts that are accused of him."
"The instructor's magistrate took this into account not to deprive him of freedom," said his lawyer, Me Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been examined and released on Tuesday night to Wednesday, with placement under judicial control for two of them, said the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic of Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director General for the Property of Marseille Provence Metropolis (MPM), is being prosecuted for "trafficking and passive corruption".
Two staff members of the Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier's collection, are being examined for one for "destruction and diversion of public goods by a person in charge of a public service mission", the other for "complicated diversion of public funds".
Finally, the company of Alexander Guerini, Jeannie Peretti, was examined for "the cause of social property abuse".
Among those who have been confronted with Mr. Guerini are Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently found in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement affecting the Corse.
Investigators suspect that their companies have served to whitewash the money of big banditism.
The investigation is carried out in the context of a number of open legal information against X in April 2009 following anonymous emails for alleged fraud in the procurement of public procurement, in particular in the waste chain.
As a result of the investigation, the investigation focuses, inter alia, on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a discharge from La Ciotat, which collects the waste from Aubagne and some cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elysée exacerbated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spiring", held the opinion in haleine in France, put diplomacy on the alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the close eye of U.S. diplomats.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by The World reveal some of the following.
They describe how Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, even giving them advice on how to deal with their own "totage" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French leaders sought to convince Washington that the release of the young French had not had to counter the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by American justice for the trafficking of materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they put under strict light the way in which the French Presidency sought to manipulate the media to believe that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, it was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram written on August 12, 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage cases".
Elysée's strategic affairs advisor, François Richier, accompanied by the Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Paoli, is interviewed with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise Americans to do so in order to return their own nationals who have been detained in Iran.
"Fades of the noise," they say, "marry incessantly" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocence", "immediate release".
It's necessary to get rid of the Iranian regime, which is sensitive to its image.
"Make it as much as the Iranians ask you not to."
Because, after the attempts to discuss through discreet channels, "the silence won't solve anything", Iranians are "masters in dilater maneuvers".
Mr. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "a family Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail".
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will take place on August 16th, the day she takes refuge at the French embassy) "will require payment to Iranians of a large amount of money" (€230,000).
And he tells us that Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will worsen".
Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been out of prison for 12 days, but remains locked up in Iran.
Information is available: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose U.S. claims extradition for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic material to Iran, is released to Paris on a judge's decision.
The American Embassy, like many observers, is questioning this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which tracks Iranian clandestine networks of acquisition of nuclear material, Majid Khakavand's expansion is a bad news.
Did France accept a trade?
The release of the Iranian against the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier made sure that this was not the case.
Elysée, he said, not only "was completely surprised by the judge's decision", but sought to oppose it.
"There was a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the guard of the seals" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot return to the judicial decision", he observed.
Mr. Richier would also like to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" supervision of the French information services.
The councillor of Elysée consists of a telephone number, hook up, and then informs the American diplomat that Iran is "now located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian Embassy".
During Clotilde Reiss' detention in Iran, Elysée did not interfere with his efforts by means of press releases and "futures" to make it clear that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad played an "important" and "influence" of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and they find that manipulation bears its fruit as several press articles affect the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 refers to "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
On what is so much "gratitude" expressed towards Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris is asked.
"Despite their full statements of praise, French officials in private recognize that they have only a vague sense of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then looks at the reasons that led Elysée to pay in this fiction.
The intense communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria", he said.
A policy launched in 2008, which "had been perceived then by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and untimely".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris seeks to "demonstrate to Syria what praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also "to sow seeds of disagreement between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. embassy knows it as a good source.
On August 11, François Richier entrusted him with: "Of course, we do not know whether the Syrians did anything."
"But we thanked them anyway."
"It should at least sow confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her to Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our compatriot".
No online games for young Koreans last night
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Cendrillon" which will prohibit adolescents from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, they have indicated government officials.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight, young people under 16 years of age, said representatives of the Departments of Culture and Family.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have difficulties studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the departmental officer in charge of the bill.
Online games will be available again at 6:00 in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the implementation of the law, he said.
The Government also plans to ask companies to limit the daily access time to these games for young people whose parents apply for them, he added.
It will also make available to people who claim free software to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online games competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, against 58 other nations.
Global 2018-2022: Fifa designates organizing countries
In full torture for suspicion of corruption, Fifa's Executive Committee designates on Thursday the organizing countries of the World Cup 2018 and 2022, an eminently political choice where influence struggles and lobbying risk taking the lead on technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the Queen of Fifa competition will take place in Europe, the traditional base of discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, the International Federation hoping to acquire new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its deployment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities of delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the heads of Belgian and Dutch government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides the measure of the economic and political issues of a World.
Thus, hive treatments may last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to the Fifa assessment report, English, Hispano-Portugal files (2018) and American (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not be very burdensome for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, in the wake of the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could thus have ruined the chances of his country, a football club that only once hosted the World Cup in 1966.
The BBC released a layer of it on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that spans three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What makes Fifa unhappy and pregnant the English officials, who have been engaged in intense lobbying these past weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The head of the government hopes to re-edit the success of his predecessor Tony Blair, who had won the JO-2012 organisation for London in 2005.
Will this intense activity be sufficient to reduce England's scourge with the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the duo Spain-Portugal lacks assets with its stages already ready, its expertise (World 82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its foot culture.
But the dark economic and financial prospects of the two countries could shower their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase Russia's share, becoming a weightier in spite of the shortcomings of its record (stands, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to make the move to Zurich and denounced a "devious competition in the preparation of the vote" in a barely veiled allusion to the charges of the English press against EC members.
"We cover them with mud, we try to compromise them," Mr. Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, strong from the 1994 experience, appeared like logical favors.
First world economic power, based on the main sponsors of Fifa, the country seems to have a long way ahead of Japan and South Korea, which have built a very good project separately.
However, these new nominations appeared premature for two countries that co-organized the trial in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of the Global-2026 to China, which is keenly desired by the Fifa, would in fact reduce the Asian chances for 2022.
With Qatar, which came out of the big game by offering futuristic stages, and Australia, Fifa would continue its expansion to new challenges, but these two countries are more at risk than certain ones.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of the TV rights paid by European countries (due to the time shift), the nerve of the war for Fifa.
Second term: evidence
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand had made him think he was hesitated.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not have the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than they are.
One mandate to the Elysée calls it another.
So the current head of state will be the candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not make a good home with the part of mystery attached to the presidential function.
So we have to act as if there was still a doubt.
One way or the other.
In 2006, even without believing it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, with a heavy air, Nicolas Sarkozy would ensure that he would take his decision "sometimes in the fall of 2011".
He mentioned to UMP parliamentarians, Tuesday evening at Elysée, that the prospect of "two mandates" had therefore been a bit of a febrileity.
Was it the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were far away.
The president merely recalled that the 2008 constitutional revision limited the number of five years.
He was making a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he mentioned the President, on the tone of humor, at such meetings.
"You've still been with me for seven and a half years," he had released in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't think that I don't think about the next step."
His speech yesterday no longer makes him a candidate for the watch; they do not make him a less.
If they make comments, it's for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race for application to the PS, on the one hand.
But it's not Ségolene Royal's high school entrance that pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal.
On the contrary, it is because its application in 2012 is clear that many of the PS advocates an order of battle earlier than expected.
Bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time right voters would prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy (46%) versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express.
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP above," said the Prime Minister immediately and prudently.
"If he believes the possible failure, he will not be a candidate," entrusts Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe he will be able to win," corrects Alain Juppe, relegated to the evidence.
Euro: The ECB is forced to maintain its acquisitions of state securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should be an opportunity to clarify the modalities for exit from the crisis or, at least, to announce the conclusion of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy operations to be completed at the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt crisis obliges the Frankfurt Emissions Institute will certainly not be able to be as peremptive as it is under the threat of exacerbating a situation that is more prevalent today in European bond markets.
The political cost would be much higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis in Europe.
She did not wish to say whether she believed that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
"I reserve my reflection on my European partners (...)".
At the hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament in Brussels, the ECB President, Jean-Claude Trichet, was no longer disserted as to his intentions, merely indicating that the secondary market securities purchase programme "continued" and that "we will see what we will decide" at this Thursday's meeting.
Only certainty: the ECB will maintain its main unchanged management rate at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the ECB’s Treasury bond purchases doubled over the past week, almost EUR 1.35 billion.
And according to market operators' indiscretions, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem's central banks have purchased €67 billion since May 2010.
Market operators have no doubt about the prospect of further procurement (see page 29).
Nor do economists expect any significant change.
If lending operations in more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latter is still subject to unlimited liquidity allocations under generous conditions and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists today expect this device to be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine that she's changing her program significantly."
"If not, it would take the risk of creating new short-term tensions," estimates Michael Schubert, the economist of the Commerzbank.
"A progressive release announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," anticipates Norbert Brems, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
On the basis of its public debt market interventions, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchases of these obligations to encourage an aton market," added Norbert Brems.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to the sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"He must replace himself at all costs with the lack of investors on the market and do so to prevent the packaging of the returns paid by the most fragile states," said an important mandatory manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates fluctuate, states will be so much more embarrassed to reduce their payout, otherwise stabilize it.
Saving the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government takes the back round
After a week of concern for Italy, the situation was somewhat relaxed, yesterday, with the decline of mandatory rates to 10 years.
A return to peace of mind.
At a meeting with the Minister of the Economy, the presidents of the region said that Giulio Tremonti had heard that the situation was "indescribable" and expected an "unpredictable" weekend, which the interested party then demented.
On Tuesday in any event, the gap with the long German rates had reached the record of 210 basic points and the price of cover contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had flown to 263 points, leading to a certain affluence in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the gap with German rates was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was declared "very concerned" by "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that she is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stellzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the absence of growth and the atonin of tax revenue that goes with, causing the State to risk no longer being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts in Brussels have been a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the current budget for the Senate is projected to be 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the European Commission estimates that the public deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (as opposed to 3.9% planned by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (as opposed to 2.7%).
Hence the noise of a new budget collection that could be put in place after the parties, for an amount of €7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures will have to be taken," said Commissioner for Economic Affairs Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy is receiving the support of international institutions.
"The basics of his economy are in order and his accounts are good, we have been repeating it for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"There is no problem in the immediate, short or long term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), Italy's demand for stabilisation efforts are less than those in other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD Chief Economist.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a censorship motion in the House of Deputies, as a result of which early elections could be held at the end of March.
Then there would be a little time for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are considering strengthening anti-crisis devices
Christine Lagarde still beat her yesterday in a press conference in Paris: "The Europeans, I think we have shown her Sunday morning and evening, are obviously solid, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary area."
Although it is true, yesterday's rest on European State obligations has brought water to governments and the ECB's mill.
But we can't talk about a normalization yet.
The Standard & Poor's rating agency has announced that it could damage Portugal's debt note, the most targeted target today by speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weighs particularly on banking systems," says the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
As much as "political time is much slower than market time".
Conscious of this hiatus and of its dangers, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis devices.
Informal consultations among the most directly concerned Finance Ministers and, more broadly, with their G20 partners are going well.
This is also true of the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the luck of non-conventional support measures to the euro area countries in the market binder (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, started a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform the extreme-oriented investors of the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to remove funds, it will certainly prepare the land.
The first FSF securities issues are scheduled next month.
Yesterday, an official representative of the United States entrusted the Reuters Agency with supporting a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment of the IMF.
First of all, Portugal and Spain are prepared to adopt structural reforms, particularly with regard to the organization of the labour market.
Reforms that add to closer austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to borrow a different path from those of Greece and Ireland.
Each and the other must avoid requesting international assistance before establishing their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the necessary structural reforms to restore lasting confidence.
Finally, European fund-holders are discussing the options available to speed up the process of standardising sovereign bonds markets.
From the move to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber had first advanced the idea that if the EUR 750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to hand over the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that a mere EUR 100 billion increase would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct injection of liquids.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism with up to 60 billion euros.
A council that has every chance of being carefully examined in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions would prevail.
Snow and ice cream: 24 departments in orange surveillance
Snowy episodes are still causing traffic difficulties, particularly on the secondary network in Britain, and are likely to disrupt certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now under orange surveillance due to the risk of snow and verglas.
The Eure, Eure- et-Loir, the Two-Sèvres and Vienna have been added to the 20 departments already in orange surveillance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and 2nd, Dordogne and Gironde, later in the night.
According to Metéo France, sustained snow warnings affect the north of Gironde and Charentes and it snows low on the island of France.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, precisely from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, or up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the Low-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
Snowy episodes are notable enough to cause traffic difficulties and disrupt certain economic activities, says Metéo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several departments were prohibited by heavy weights of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
The traffic on the secondary network in Britain is very difficult according to the gendarmeries that recommend taking its vehicle only if necessary and the traffic of certain TER cars has been suspended for the day.
School transport was banned for Thursday in Picardie.
No specific measure was envisaged on Wednesday evening to restrict the movement of heavy weights.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to the greatest caution on the roads and to adapt their conduct accordingly".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25 per cent of their flights to the Paris airport of Roissy on Thursday and 10 per cent in Orly due to upcoming snowfalls.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their company.
In Great Britain, Gatwick Airport, South London, and Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernization of transport in Ile-de-France has been taking its toll, billions of people have been raining.
At least in the discussion.
In particular, 23 billion are mentioned for the Grand Paris Metro that needs to be built by the Grand Paris Society.
To start this SGP, the state has announced a capital allocation of €4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, this amount will then allow the SGP to lend on the markets a part of the financing of its double cycle.
Today, we finally reach the first additions.
The 2010 Correctional Finance Act, which was examined by the National Assembly Finance Commission this morning, contains the planned arrangements to find the start of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in office tax in Ile-de-France.
The first, read in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is encrypted: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is a redistribution of a tax on offices that already exists "to modernise, increase the product and affect this increase to the Grand Paris Society".
How much did that report?
Mystery.
This is not encrypted in the text.
We're 4 billion away.
"It is stated that these tax resources are added to the €4 billion of the capital fund that will be mobilised by the State and brought to the Grand Paris Society for and as the project is planned," can be read in the explanatory statement.
At the SGP, we don't find this shocking system.
"From the time you create revenue (the two taxes, etc.), you can cover the studies over three years and then tap into the 4 billion after, it's explained."
"This will be recorded in the budget and taken for granted."
The GSP estimates that the 4 billion will start to be registered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This instrument, in which the promised 4 billion are still to be made available to the absentees, is likely to provoke a bit of a heated parliamentary debate.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Avenger hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it appears to be an apparent scandal, a scandal that only appears as a scandal in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
Secondly, it announces profound changes at the international level and presupposes a future dominated by regression.
But let's do it in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file consisting of a secret service (of any nation) consists exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary" U.S. revelations on Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those that Berlusconi owns), and Khadafi's painfully caricature profile has long been for sketch cabaret artists.
The rule that secret files must be composed only of new ones already known is essential to the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeats (on the Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Temples or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in the previous books.
And this is not only because the author of hidden texts does not like doing unpublished research (he doesn't know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism believe only what they already know, and who confirms what they have already learned.
It's Dan Brown's success mechanism.
I'm going for the secret files.
The informant is stubborn, and stubborn (or limited) the head of the secret services (or I may be, as I know, editor in Liberia), who does not hold as true what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that Rome's US Embassy sent to the State Department was the same as Newsweek published the previous week.
So why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what any cultivated person already knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of World War II, and since the heads of state can call or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representation exercises, have turned into espionage centres.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that we make it seem to ignore it.
However, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and it serves to place American diplomacy under a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that a hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the world's most powerful country brings an unmindable blow to the prestige of the State Department.
Also, the scandal doesn't strike the victims as well as the "bottles".
But let us come to the deep nature of what has happened.
So, in Orwell's time, we could design any power like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had been fully realized since, with the ability to control each movement through the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the motorway borrowed, and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when we demonstrate, as it happens now, that even the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the revenge of the citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the possibility of keeping its own secrets be kept?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be disclosed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret of secret, because it belongs to the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks did, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets meant to take away all power.
WikiLeaks didn't hurt Sarkozy or Merkel, but it did too big in Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused by a very powerful power?
It is clear that in the future, States will no longer be able to put any reserved information online - this would be published again on a poster collected at the corner of the street.
But it is also clear that with current technologies, it is unlikely to be able to maintain confidential reports by telephone.
Nothing easier than to find out if and when a head of state moved on board and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved reports be maintained in the future?
I know for the time being that my prediction is true of science fiction and is therefore Romanic, but I am forced to imagine government agents who are moving discreetly in diligence to uncontrollable routes, being bearers only of messages learned from the heart or, at the most, by hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be kept as a unique copy in key-closed drawers: at the bottom, the Watergate spying attempt had less success than WikiLeaks.
I've had the opportunity to write that technology is now on the rise, that is to say, back-up.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a wire telegraph (telephones).
Videocassettes (analogues) allowed film researchers to explore a step-by-step film, moving forward and backward and discovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now CDs (numerics) only allow to skip chapter in chapter, i.e. by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, and the moves it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not unusual that communication policies and techniques return to horse cars.
One last observation.
At the same time, the press tried to understand what was being done in the secret of the embassies.
Now, it is the embassies who are asking for confidential information to the press.
Climate: how France manages its funding promises
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine the implementation of the quickly unlocked funding commitments (such as fast start or early funding) made by developed countries.
And the big French bottles are revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed themselves to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised €7.2 billion over three years and France €1.26 billion (that is €420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU came out of the big game to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start funding: a report detailing the action of its Member States, press conference, major event page, brochure distribution...
Transparency is appreciated and appreciated at its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announced that it had made €2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it on track for compliance with its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look at the details, things are more complicated.
This money must be, under the Copenhagen Agreement, "new and additional", in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without prejudice to State aid for development.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what it means "new and additional".
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States whose France has blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission has considered 2009 as a reference: international funding is maintained, and it adds 150 million over three years to fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year-on-year or in terms of level of public development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the funding of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to previous years' expenditure or to the overall level of State aid for development.
Specifically, the total amount of France's support to developing countries can remain stable (or even diminish), it claims to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funding...
Another crucial element is the distribution of gifts and loans.
There are still no rules and each one chooses its calculation mode.
Some, such as France, consider that 1€ loan is equivalent to 1€ given.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the mitigation of emissions based on more efficient technologies), it is necessary to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given to it... Moreover, it should be counted only on the cost of the loan for the lending country (that is the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has only such reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million by making 91.5% of loans (EUR 389.8 million) and 8.5% of donations (EUR 36.1 million) - see the EU document to check on your own.
It is the only country in the Union to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46% of it, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in other cases) comply with their commitments with 100% of donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union makes 1€ to meet its commitment, France only makes 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice pass tour!
In short, in its fast start financing, France operates a double scam: on the one hand, on the evolution of action over time and on the other, on the reality of financial effort.
By spending only EUR 36.1 million, it can be believed that it spends 420 million "new and additional" in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy has done the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would other Member States continue to give if it was enough to borrow?) and in negotiations as developing countries are not completely dumb...
The early financing chapter is only a small, relatively short-term issue compared to all climate discussions.
But it could be a grain of more sand in the huge machine that's the UNICEF.
Let's hope that won't be the case.
In any case, it is necessary to learn lessons from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its accounting mode for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and equity with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could advance discussions on long-term financing issues (another crucial chapter currently discussed): we will not escape the issue of "additionality" or the way in which loans are accounted for.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister of the Environment, Ms Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on the rapid start of France and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would naturally increase the level of international confidence needed to advance the discussions.
Alert to child-ingested pesticides
A 10-year-old ingested 81 different chemicals on a day, according to a study published this Wednesday of the Future Generations Association (ex-The Movement for Rights and Respect for Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value in view of the low number of samples analysed, but are illustrative of the treated problem", bought between July and September food generally consumed in four meals and one in a day by a child of ten years, in the supermarkets of Oise and Paris.
These types of meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as colds, have been examined by laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The table below is complete: 81 chemicals of which 42 are classified as possible or likely carcinogenic and five carcinogenic substances as well as 37 substances that may act as endocrine disruptors (PEs), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even though, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, our investigation shows that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE contaminants is worrying," notes the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three reported as certain carcinogens, as well as nearly twenty residues likely to disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, provided for in the study, contains traces of six chemicals, a fungicide which is still banned in France.
The same thing for Kenya's green sharks, including in lunch, on which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the hooked steak, the boxed tuna, and even the bread bag and the chewing gum were affected by pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water, the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, the salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the examination of the plastic seat used to heat the microwave meal was not exempt.
The final risk for consumers of this "contaminant cocktails" is "probably underestimated", according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), on the other hand, proposed that a moratorium on the use of pesticides should be set up to stop "the increase in civilisation diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 of which in cereals.
