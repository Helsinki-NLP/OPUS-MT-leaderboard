28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old cook who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping center.
The victim's brother said he couldn't imagine anyone wanting to hurt him, "It finally went up again with him."
The body found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the department of medical medicine in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigations are underway.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABS Sender KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a chef in Boston, had spent six months in his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters Restaurant in San Francisco.
One speaker of the Son & Daughter said that they were "shocked and destroyed on the ground" about his death.
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss it painfully," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and our policies are at this difficult time with Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank first lived in hostels, but that, "the things finally went up for him."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone wanting to hurt his younger brother.
He was a friendly person with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was always to cook something to prepare us for dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute.
He was the brother who swam with the electricity.
"In everything that is going on in the world, he was this unspoilt diamond that lit light every day," he said.
Anyone who has information on the case will be asked to call the SFPD's reference phone under number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always stuck in sheets
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood Star has made this clear in an interview.
"I'm always stuck in drawers or getting stuck out of outer labels that have mostly little to do with me and reality."
"I myself do not wish to be always perfect and successful."
"To be honest, I'm rather tired of these things."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered "Miss Perfect" as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The most popular is that the actress spends her time at home, in the form of a TV with a loose dot and Mexican food, it says in the magazine.
She asks the question of the wish for children: "We women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect," says Hollywood Star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a child's game" Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film runs with us from August 25th.
Golfer Langer gets the sport pyramid
His experiences on the horse are observable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer, with some colleagues, was looking for a slight change with an exit to the beach.
For the 58-year-olds, it was a premiere.
CHIO: "Golden Sport Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes the horses remembered at their celebration night, they hunted in the fast gallop home to the feeding troughs.
A kilometer at this rate, I was afraid.
"It wasn't a good experience," he says.
And that's when the horse's career ended.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all times - 101 tournament wins - was back in the vicinity of horses.
He and his family were able to drive over the installation of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even jump for photo purposes.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid handed over the Golden Sport Pyramid to the man from his home in a small gala.
Awards are not missing from the sympathetic sportsman.
Federal Merit Cross, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already named him.
Longer is the 18th prize winner of the sport pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it will not only be awarded for sports success, but also for social engagement".
For decades, Langer has been promoting the growth of the population.
And so did he continue to pay the price of 25,000 euros.
With 15 outstanding athletes, the two-time US Masters winner was admitted to the Hall of Fame of German Sports on Saturday.
The winners include the lightweight athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Fighter Cornelius Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-Fahrer Meinhard Nehmer, Judoka Frank Wieneke, the Spring Rider Alwin Shocker and the Handballer Erhard Wonderlich.
Many of these athletes came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrative company moved to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza prize went.
Bernhard Langer kept away from the big animals.
Clinton's and Trump's economic policy in comparison: It's all about the money
Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump want to do so.
However, the two US presidential candidates are also involved in tax and energy policy and in a matter of principle.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns of how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate to death, he says.
On the other hand, he'd be quite different, says Trump.
It will bring regulations back massively, and it will make itself strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the state has certain tasks to perform, it has unfavourable opportunities to open up and needs money to do so.
That's why taxes would increase for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.
The need to invest, Trump and Clinton say it's almost worth it.
The democratic applicant even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are, for example, strictly rejected by the Republican state-critical tea party.
Therefore, there could still be internal discussions on Trump.
The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.
Trump wants to build coal plants and boost coal promotion in the United States.
Oil promotion should also be possible in areas so far protected that the Paris Agreement on Climate Change wants to be repealed.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to develop the renewable energies explicitly with its investment programme and calls for "a country to become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs."
"It'll probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."
But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements - the two competitors are not far from each other.
The TPP, which is a transitional trade agreement, does not want to sign both.
At the same time, however, both of them do not want to isolate the United States from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better.
They're supposed to be paid better, like Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hungry wage.
She wants to raise it to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do in this matter is not quite clear: Once he says: the minimum wage must be lifted, then he says he must not be changed.
However, the great discussion of the coming months should be more likely to develop around the fiscal policy of the two camps.
On one side stands Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to stimulate growth.
His critics insist that the budget deficit be even greater.
On the other hand, Clinton stands, who at least wants the rich to pay more taxes, and their critics say that more taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every refugee woman has experiences with sexual violence"
Sexual violence belongs to women fleeing alone almost every day.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
Four women are sitting in a big kitchen.
Everyone has a baby who's at least one year old.
One put her little son in her arm.
He looks curiously into the room with large eyes.
His mother is staring at the table.
Until she notices that she's being observed.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little ones.
The scene's normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is a district businessman from Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance services in Bavaria, and deals, among other things, with the issue of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the München North in one of the few decentralized accommodation for single refugees and their children in Bavaria.
In January Condrobs set up the facility together with Pro Family and the Munich Women's Support.
It has recently been officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - nor as visitors.
The exception is a guard in front of the door.
"It is not excessive to say: Every woman who arrives here has had experiences of sexual violence on her escape," says Bahr.
"Men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted because they are threatened with torture or death or because their families send them as hope bearers to Europe," she says.
In women, there are other reasons for escape: "Many secretly steal from it because they don't see any other way out."
In their home they have had experience with sexual violence, violence, honour, slavery or forced prostitution.
That's what she's doing.
On the run, it goes on.
"For example, the trailer for a bottle of water requires sexual action, is not rare," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Anyone who believes that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, is wrong, tells Bahr.
Here, too, single women in refugee shelters would often be viewed as inferior and abused.
This means that about 90 percent of the women living in the accommodation in Munich North are traumatized, she estimates.
"Some of the children have certainly not been created voluntarily."
Many women are so used to saying nothing.
"Or they don't trust to talk openly about the experience because the shame is too great."
Since they often didn't know how to help themselves, it only takes more accommodation for them, demands Bahr.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
The question is whether they knew of a similar project like in Munich in their field of competence, some answer with No.
There is, for example, no such thing in government accommodation in the upper ceiling and the upper ceiling.
Even in slums alone, refugee women are not separated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, government press spokesman.
In the upper bayers, sub- and mid-frontiers, there are in some community accommodation floors or own houses only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bayern, there are two central accommodation for women only.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be treated separately from men.
In a study published for the Committee, it says: "It is very important that men and women be accommodated separately."
"If the private sphere is lacking or men and women are brought together, violence against women can occur - continuously."
In particular, the bathrooms should be separated and easy to access for women is included in the study.
As women feel this need for protection, they can be placed on the Andrank, which is on the house in Munich.
"Since we've talked about it, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Strike out assistance doctors: Demands for new work combat measures
Representatives of assistant doctors have called on their trade unions to approve new work combat measures in their disputes concerning a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called on its entire Council to adopt more work combat measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC said it had failed to address the concerns of the contract.
Doctors and medical students agreed in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members, published on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC President Ellen McCourt said that the government would remain "quietly calm" about problems, which led to the rejection of the contract.
She said, "In view of this, the JDC Board has voted to reject the proposed new treaty completely and has called for formal renegotiation of all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Board today has formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating work struggles beginning in early September.
The disputes led to assistant doctors six times this year, the first total accidents in the history of the NHS.
The Director of the BMA Assistant Doctor Dr. Johann Malavana withdrew after the election to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the BMA.
He shared with BMA members during the meetings, which were held before the vote by 54,000 medical practitioners and medical students, that the contract should be favourable and adopted.
After the vote, Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors would be forced into England.
Russia and Turkey: "A Alliance of Foreigners"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to hold hands and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomes his Turkish opponent in the golden hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.
There was the handbuff, yes.
But Putin's smile seemed narrow and he barely radiated heat, even for his dependent relationships.
On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his "loved friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old levels before the crisis, but would even improve.
The next day described a newspaper that Erdogan would have felt so bad.
His enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite.
But one of Putin's sustainable refrigerators showed that the head of state had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening words: the launching of a Russian fighter aircraft at the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow's reaction to the time was angry.
Putin distributed and accused Ankara of falling behind Russia.
The sin was even greater, as it had been committed by a supposed friend.
Rehabilitation of the vetrau will be difficult if not even impossible.
The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media launched a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
At one point it seemed as if the Turks were guilty of everything.
The most serious were the allegations by leading officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from the illegal oil trade in Syria, which is controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He fought this very hard.
But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia was able to win a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clearly at hand.
Erdogan first needs all the friends he can get after he was kidnapped last month at a failed state strike.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey also shocked him.
But there are also economic reasons.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has decreased by almost 90%.
Travel organisers and charter companies will be relieved in Russia when the flights are resumed.
They count on a late-sea storm.
This week, the state television forecasted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "Tourists there for a long time, tomatoes here for a long time."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West because it considers its reaction to the attempted takeover as a weak response.
In addition, the continuing grip on the pace of the EU accession negotiations and Putin – which is designed to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce Turkey's relation to the West.
The Russian head of state in Ankara won a bonus for demanding support from the elected state bodies after the attempted coup.
This is well-known for Moscow's self-understanding, which itself has a deep fear of regime change.
The summit in this magnificent palace at the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present, as an analyst once described to me, a "ally of external sides": two countries that are breaking down from the west and feeling badly treated and now bonding.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played its role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that, after almost three hours of first talks, the two presidents said at the press conference that they had not even punished the subject.
The President of Turkey has deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin has decided to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State at least speak again.
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
According to the Bank’s head of management, RBS is intended to be reduced only to a back office roll.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has since distanced itself when it had to be nearly collaborated and saved eight years ago.
At the time, brand strategies "RBS" have used to protect other end-user financial markets.
She supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsoring, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentral headquarters and the stock exchange rating will change to NatWest.
The brand Ulster Bank is already being used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for the private customer business that will get more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The brand RSB will be our brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we will now become a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I am saying now that we are not pursuing global goals but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations Sponsoring and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsoring.
"It is time for us to develop into a brand bank, because how do we concentrate inside (we have asked) on making this a better bank for customers?" the Chief Executive said.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.
We can relaunch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieves his 3,000th Newmarket profit at predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket that brings him 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori won his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He put on predilection, which is trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey who reaches the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who won on Ghayyar before, said, "It's something special."
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very modest.
Dettori picks up the jubilee when he wins at predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, who had nine-time Derby winners, had 4,493 careers
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that only a few before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and Charisma has been fanning for years for this kind of sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already won 6,000 if he wasn't just a weekend and a big tournament jockey!
Frankie has already won in GB for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a living personality that is good for a British race, but he is also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical flying dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the sign of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nervous.
A number of major tournaments won, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago he had difficulties when he returned from his six-month barrier, but he showed an impressive character strength to overcome his doubts and return to his best form.
And he hasn't been at the end for a long time - Dettori said earlier that he wanted to continue in competition until at least his 50th year of life.
Russia's Putin fire chief Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly released his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been a part of Putin's narrowest circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.
In an opinion of the Kremlin it is said that Putin has "ordered Ivanov's resignation from his duties as President of the Russian presidential administration without giving reasons".
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, has been appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned National Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin website it is said (in Russian) that he was later the chief of protocol and staff of government staff.
About his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think that it is the Government's main task to support your activities as head of state with regard to draft laws and controls for the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his posts and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Convince the smiling faces?
This step has made Moscow a secret web.
Sergei Ivanov has been one of Vladimir Putin's closest associates for a long time and works as he does for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff had come back on their own.
But despite the smile for the cameras, there are only a few of them here - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.
So is this the consequence of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows right now.
But the official claim - that a man who was once praised as a potential president wants to lead the Russian environmental policy at one time - was very sceptical.
In his comments to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "it is true that in early 2012, I asked you to trust these very complicated posts - you could almost say - difficult posts for four years.
As it turns out, I have been President of the Russian Presidency for four years and eight months.
Ivanov accepted the posts in December 2011.
He was previously the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB State Security Service like Putin.
In the late 1990s, as Putin President of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
As Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of five people he most trusted.
It was once assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term of office, as a third term of office would have violated Putin's constitution.
But these items were taken by another nearby allies of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after he hit producers
Gibson was involved last month in a physical dispute at the set of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced its cancellation in a joint opinion.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday before announcing his announcement.
In the set there were artistic differences and a variety of opinions.
I regret the incident," he said in a statement.
Details of how the character of Gibsons from the series followed by a team of FBI agents is written out are expected to be published at a later date, according to the opinion of the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old who previously played in Sitcom Dharma & Greg was with him since the first staff of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have entered my whole heart's blood for the last 12 years," said Gibson in a statement published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there by the end, but that will not be possible anymore.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and, above all, the best fans you can only wish for for a series.
The planned radiation of the twelfth staff is set up on 28 September.
Puzzles about fish landing in the garden in Banff
A Banff resident called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks it could be about the 75 fish for sandals that have been drained by a spring fountain.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, released a video of the show on Periscope in hopes that someone could throw some light on the appearance of two-inch long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to fife
The £1.35 billion expensive project is to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the North deck of the Queensferry Crossing with the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to the fife.
It is the first of the four locks of the "coverblades", which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 treads.
The £1.35 billion expensive project is to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the building today and was one of the first to go from country to bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic dimension in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the lock between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tough activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit.
In total, almost 79% of all decks are in their place and the last section of the deck today receives a concrete boost for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be mounted on the bridge in its place.
Michael Martin, project manager of Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first closure is a significant milestone for each bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure is a future-looking high and low construction.
After the installation of the last section of the road deck and its connection to the north tower deck in the construction, we had to close the remaining gaps on the north side or the country side.
This was achieved by pulling the north bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and very slow activity at the same time.
Massive, since the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards by about 3%.
Heikel, since the tolerances the team is working on were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Luckily, everything went very well.
Rescue in the Moelfre Bay: Three men have "Happyness Still in Life"
Three men have "happiness still in life" after being thrown by their fishing boat before England.
The Moelfre RNLI Rescue Station beat at 13:20 BST alarm on Friday, after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming safely, while their boat continued to move from its own strength.
"We saw how the boat turned around and presented us with the worst," said the head of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
" Thankfully, the strong winds have already weighed the boat outside its reach until we let it into the water," he added.
Two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat, while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a boat without rescue.
They all came aboard the coast rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said: "The three men who have been thrown into the water have been unharmed and still alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop, the boat set off at the center of the boat from the person who controlled the boat.
Someone's been waiting for these men today.
Severely injured - a man climbs on his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholics cut off his ex-girlfriend's clothes.
When she got into the apartment, he hit her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured by hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the killer.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's dress, he called his mother.
This one then alarmed his sister.
Together with her lifelong companion, the 45-year-olds wanted to calm down their brother.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she left the house with her friend.
On the street they met the man's ex-life companion.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and Greens mean that investors are going to be much stronger in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that in the next few years, Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments?
The SPD proposes a "Action Concept" for the next meeting of the Council.
But the dispute is programmed.
First of all, it is the question: Who really should build the cheap apartments?
There's still a regime missing.
SPD Group President Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: Whoever wants to build on urban areas must show 20 percent of all apartments as social apartments in the future."
However, the cheap apartments can also be created in the stock.
However, Bratmann said: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private premises?"
"We want investors on such areas to build at least 10 per cent, but not more than 20 per cent of the apartments as social apartments."
A new urban housing support programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, should provide incentives.
The problem, Bratmann said: "There is still no agreement between the groups."
The CDU wants investors to make as few rules as possible.
The left wants more hard work for investors.
In spite of this, Bratmann says, there is an increase in the situation on the housing market.
If the concept of action is implemented, this will provide for additional tasks in the construction management.
More staff will be needed.
It's unclear if we'll get the experts.
However, the programme is still not complete: because about 1260 new apartments should be built anyway.
How, though, can the loss of some 1,300 more affordable apartments be compared to the loss of which will be funded in the coming years?
Only by 2020 will there be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, so planned political speaker Nicole Palm should now be bought out of the city.
In addition, consideration should be given to getting apartments back into the price chain.
This is possible in the West City.
At one stroke, the problem was solved.
Because in the West City they run out of time to the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price chain for cheap apartments.
Only: This is what the owners, the housing companies do not want.
Because the number of social apartments in the West City is increasing dramatically again, away from the goal of so-called fusion.
There should be no more concentration of social deficits in just a few parts of the city.
The Greens estimate that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Group president Holger Herlitschke said: "For a large majority, the CDU must take the boat."
It has concentrated on more building sites for single-family homes.
But what does not mean that a compromise cannot be found yet.
Pokémon Go, a Hunting for Health and Happiness That Rewards
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their time watching on screens, has been complained about by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people out of the sofa and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially on television, then on video games and last time on smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that technologies and activities in the open are not mutually exclusive.
I refer, of course, to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were originally created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created).
Like many pop culture phenomena, the interest in publishing the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand fell somewhat early in July.
The introduction of the market in other countries was postponed by the massive demand overloaded by the server.
Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than teenagers and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokeémons that are tracked with a GPS and, once they are found, can be "photographed" (by a screenshot on the phone) or " caught".
A generation that played the game when she was even younger, joined the passion and ran for the search of the sofa.
In the United States, the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "average" person slows down every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users, announced recently that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of followed-up people who train 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for performance increase.
Many public awareness campaigns on health, which people want to bring, "take 30 minutes to get time," "from the sofa" and "from being active every day" are hit by deaf ears because many public messages are boring and come from people who look miserable.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overestimated.
Those who regularly drive sports reduce their chances of getting sick of cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps to control weight, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to bring them here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something free to make fun of them.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunlight as well as fun.
Some people even make new friendships on the hunt.
As always, there are also masculine game destroyers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could walk against a door.
What do you want?
There's been a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps such as Fitbit had already been able to track our activity, they did not give us any reason to drive sports as this game does.
The new will lose its relic and use will be abandoned in time.
Because of Pokemon's success, however, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with activeness in the real world and help many people hunt to be active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in diamond
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jumper.
No effort on the bar.
Breathing on the floor.
On the whole line brilliant.
And now finally, too, the Olympics.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American tournament became the title of the multi-stakeholder and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Her total score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the Silver Medal Winner and Final Five teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian Bronze Medal Winner Aliya Mustafina.
The American Simone Biles is playing on the swimming bar during the single-major women's competition in the art tournament at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multiple title and in total the fifth, while holding her call to be the best of her generation or even at all.
She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at this moment ended.
This success makes them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated his sport for the last three years, 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of enthusiasm and precision that the 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is "the best tournament I've ever seen."
She expected a final exam in Brazil, a competition that did not go so far between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.
Not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered a disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hug each other after winning gold and silver at the women's single-major competition finals in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday, while she served at the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi as a sign of departure.
Although Biles insisted on never planning the future during their long journey to the top, that is not really true.
Part of its ground exercises - which contain its typical Tumbling Pass - are tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympiaarena in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a child and was discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the tournament in which Boorman was trained, became strong.
She has not lost any more competition since the summer of 2013, a series that will last as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafina led easily through two rotations, the picture was worn.
Swedes and floor towers - in which cars hold the title of the world champion - were well-known.
She picked up 15,433 again on the swivel bar - and placed another 15,933 on the floor.
Raisman hugged her gently when she expected her finality - a pure formality - and tears flowed to Biles brilliantly red, white and blue eyeliner, when the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.
The performance of Raismans was a race for the last four years when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went into a divebrake at Mustafina.
This time the 22-year-old team captain, called "Oma", had an advantage.
After her ground practice she threw kisses at the audience, dominated by a comeback that sometimes appeared doubtful.
As for Biles, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims shot in a car in a serial killing
According to police reports, released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the most deadly attacks in Phoenix's first serial murder for a decade while they were in the car and listened to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June, while the car was parked in an entrance, the authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight guns from a gun, while he stood on the side of the car and then ran off with another vehicle, is to be read in the report.
The police reported that the three-time murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not include the pockets or $2,900 that were owned by one of the adults.
The police spokesperson of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investigators to gain a closer look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others injured, mainly in Spanish residential areas within four months.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," Howard told KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.
It is assumed that the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to open the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized and later died because of her injuries.
Linear, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died on site.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting which aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the three-hour murder and will assume that it was the work of the serial killer.
Designers found cartridges and secured a bullet from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like the least of his peers, Edmund Microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, it was my first thought, I couldn't do it.
I can't do this.
That's what I didn't give up on.
What's not right at all -- of course you've made it," she said.
Vincent and her husband were told that Edmund would never be able to recognize them under circumstances and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to propose institutionalization.
"My first answer to that was 'I didn't know that people were still doing,' said Picciuto.
Edmund can run with help.
Edmund was unable to sit or scratch until his third year of life, and he can't even speak.
But he's making slow progress.
He can run with support and bike.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund intended for "Please sing something to me."
"We bring him sign language," Picciuto CBS reported.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some characters alone.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetics such as Edmund and infections with viruses such as masts or the zikavirus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly.
It is too early to say how life will affect those infected with the Zikavirus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking what was going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked for the forecast for a long time now because I don't expect her to really tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It'll be better.
You know it'll get better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, floods give rise to rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and large-scale floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call out the emergency on Friday. It is calculated on Saturday with more rains.
Many rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and south of Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened with major flooding after extreme rains, the National Weather Service reported.
The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards told us that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help to the affected communities is already on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesperson for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said that the demands for high water vehicles, boats and sandbags increased.
Steele said that only the municipality of Tangipahoea had required ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system is being used across far south Louisianas until Saturday.
The weather service made it clear that additional 3-5 inches could fall in rain in this area.
In southern Alabama a flood warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The River Committee near Baton Rouges and the River Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, will reach all probability after the weekly record level.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the surrounding Baton Rouge.
He also said that a current-directioned flood in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as it will flow slowly through the falling rivers into Lake Maurepas.
The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, already reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09:00.
Rescue teams were still taking people out of the floodwaters in the districts Amite and Wilkinson in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his nephew were among those who were saved on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, increased sharply overnight.
He said another stepfather would have warned him who lived nearby.
"We are awake and the water flowed and flowed in," Hansford said.
It reached my size.
His wife told Hansford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that emergency aiders had saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire department in Gloster where they had been detained until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flooding had "extended rapidly" as there were still heavy rains and that the authorities were considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain.
Krautmann said that the soil has been significantly drained by the rains since Wednesday.
The authorities indicated that heavy rains and flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoea Parish and educational failure in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that an associate in Tangipahoea indicated oversweet houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, both now flooded.
The head of the municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets who had been washed out of the high water.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency accommodations were set up to accommodate the evacuated.
"As soon as the water starts to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoea, nearly two dozen streets were closed due to the high water and sandbags were provided for the inhabitants to receive, hoping to keep the water from their houses and shops.
"The last great flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum from the city administration.
This seems to be a similar case.
In Mississippi, Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it was still raining on the Gulf Coast.
According to his statements, a handful of houses on Thursday were reported as flooded, but on Friday they were not reported until now.
Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "perforated by bullets", survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police report that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week for the second time that a 6-year-old child will be shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents indicated that Brown suffered several gunshot injuries, including in the country, leg, arm and stomach, but that he was aware of his transport to the hospital.
"He went through a lot, his little body was pierced by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the sender.
I just can't believe it.
The condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the transmitter that he was likely to be healed again.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also attacked: two men at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are according to CBS Philadelphia in stable condition.
The boy was shot at at the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old who is in critical condition, reports the transmitter.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police were not sure if they could be under one of the injured men of the offenders.
The investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it seemed to have come to a crossfire between several shields.
Pattern shells for storm rifles that were traced back to different storm rifles passed the scene.
It seems that this has clearly been a constant struggle.
On the street, on both sides of the road, there were caves.
It seems that there were several armed fighters here who were very actively involved," said police chief Anthony Ginaldi of the police in Philadelphia to the sender.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There were no arrests and the police are currently checking the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a crossbow on her arm when she was playing in front of her house in the West Oak Lane residential area.
She recovers and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is what I imagine under the women's Olympic team in the tournament and for more than one reason.
First of all, I've been at every summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second, this team has three tournaments, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which were inspiring to many young girls of other skin colors.
The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, who is a Jew and Madison Kocian, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has fortified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one of the women tournaments was an African American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
That shows strength.
In the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and American jubilant.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected but masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone won the fourth heterosexual American in an individual multi-fighting event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won Silver.
We experience the tops of this kind of sport, but so do not look like tournament classes throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five", because the next Olympic team will have only four tournaments in the team. Besides, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a coach.
But the reality seems to be that tournaments are a expensive sport and tournaments primarily in private tournaments maintained by parents for training, institution, travel, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their tournaments and families).
The majority of these tournaments are located in affluent suburbs that can support the business.
In these associations, the tournaments receive their entire training and this is a expensive and long-term commitment for families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started the tournament.
We need to enable the communities, including countless young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, to be able to play a more efficient and easier turn.
I founded my 20-year-old tournament.
In my events, we offered free and affordable tournaments in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the young people a high-quality tournament that deserves the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turns develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It is the inspiration of this team to make thousands of young girls interested in the tournament and that is great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real performance of "Girl Power" through the collection of the Olympic team gold and thanks, you capture so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way, become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organize further strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunts' proposal
The ministers had hoped to be able to put an end to the dispute over the amendments by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in a vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt had revealed plans to enforce the contract and said that the NHS was in a "no man's country" and any further delay would be detrimental to the employees and patients.
The first assistant doctors are expected to receive a new contract containing changes to night and weekend work in order to improve the care of unaccompanied hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Committee on Assisting Doctors last night, said in a statement: "Assistant doctors are still seriously concerned about the proposed contract, especially that it is heating up the current crew crisis and will refrain from treating all doctors properly."
In only eight weeks that remain until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract, progress has to be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes through discussions were made by the government to participate in protests and sometimes to silence the ears.
This happened to a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt now has to act, lift the upheaval and address the concerns of the assistants."
If he does not do this, it has made it clear to the assistants that they are ready to take further work combat measures.
The last strike at the end of April saw a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, since nurses and doctors were involved to provide coverage to doctors on the strike chain.
The ministers had hoped to be able to put an end to the dispute over the amendments by adopting the reformed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants a better weekly salary for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of NHS Staff, called on the assistant doctors to finish the strike.
Mortimer said: "Work combat measures do not reach anything but load overloaded teams and service providers and provide patients, nurses and their families with only anxiety, need and interruption."
In the last two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistive Doctors and with the Ministry of Health and other ministries have responded positively to concerns about premunities and Whistleblowing.
Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as delivery, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a professional period, training costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and gender-specific wage cases in medicine - was a sign of how serious it was for employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2-per-day medication that can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart myocardial infarction patients will benefit from a £2-per-day medication after being recommended by the authorities to give this more people for a longer period of time.
The anti-inflammatory medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
This medicine has been given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS NICE Regulatory Authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS NICE Regulatory Authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of it suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by collections of fatty materials in the artery walls, which form layers.
If the coating breaks out, it can cause a blood clot that suppresses the blood flow to the heart and thus causes a heart attack.
If the bloodstream dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and suppress the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.
The guide of NICE, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90 mg Ticagrelor followed by 60 mg with twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, one quarter of all people who have had a heart attack, another heart attack or stroke often have devastating consequences."
Fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.
Experience has shown that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The draft guidelines do not recommend treatment beyond this period.
Culture of Political Justice allows electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim areas
Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year on the occasion of a government report for corruption from the office
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities being deliberately ignored, as a devastating government report revealed today.
The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, electoral observers and councillors for ignoring evidence of abuse due to "excessive feelings of ethnicity and religion".
The former Minister for Integration and Municipal Government, now an anti-corruption king, said that the intimidation of voters on religious grounds would be so bad that it should be allowed for the police to set up barriers outside of the polling booths to protect the voters.
He recommends that voters take a statement with them to prove their identity in elections.
Currently, a voter must only name his name and address.
The report proposes to apply non-removeable ink to a person's finger when they vote to prevent a person from choosing twice.
Whistleblower should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
He calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.
"This not only serves to protect the municipal government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud, which is involved," he said.
The report was organised by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet's election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court decided that the incumbent mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be removed from his office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "converted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with racist and Islamic accusations.
Rahman will "have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of a succession in which a person chooses someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He spoke particularly alarmingly of the fraudulent letter - the older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate for their election.
Sir Eric, depicted, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including the guidance of evidence to prove the identity
His report states: "As evidence that pressure on the necessary members of certain ethnic minorities has been exercised, particularly women and young people, in order to choose, as the elderly will, communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds, in particular.
"There was concern that... state institutions would have deliberately ignored such behaviour because of "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric issued 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the prohibition that political activists should edit letterboards to stop "electors".
The report, considered by Theresa May, also requires stricter registration checks to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters before choosing your statement.
Use non-removeable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Systematic checks on the nationality of a person shall be carried out to ensure that they are eligible.
A three-year limitation on applications for an automatic letter.
It prohibits political activists from processing complete letters and envelopes of letters.
The police give the authority to set up blockades to set up polling stations.
An amendment of the law which facilitates an accusation of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983 (the People's Act 1983).
Photographing ban in polling stations.
The requirement that only English should be used in the polling stations (with the exception of Wales).
Intensification of training to ensure that employees implement the rule that voters go to the polling booth alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "surprising", that after the Tower Hamlet's case there was no penalty.
"The electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy for the sake of a litany of corrupt and illegal practices as inadvertent," he said.
He was found guilty for a number of reasons, according to the high requirements of criminal law.
He also criticises the ineffective "abhak controls" of the electoral registration departments of the Council Houses.
Sir Eric said: "The courthouse in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of Parliament, is a proud heritage, but the worrying and veiled spread of electoral fraud and the denial of some authorities threatens this good reputation.
Crazy for Kates Radler doubles and other famous doubles of Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have done this week about the French bike sportsman Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, apart from Rand and Band, who has proved to be an impressive double-walker of the Duke of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympionicin is far from the only gold-fighting athlete who shows up his own famous doubles - at least not if you can give social media faith.
In honor of the Olympics in Rio and all the famous faces that flash on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that show more than just a certain similarity with Hollywood celebrities.
The hunter and the wolf: team member of the US team in the bow shot Brady Ellison, left, will be compared since his childhood with Leonardo DiCaprio
With the exception of Kate's two-way train, many people online pointed out how a certain arch shield of the twins of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio could be.
The team member of the US team in the bow shot, Brady Ellison, caused a riot on Twitter after he appeared incredibly similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star.
In fact, the archer got mad in the social media and admitted that he's already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I don't see a big similarity myself, except for facial expression," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess I'll take this as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be more focused this year: the striking similarity between the British wide jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian tournament Aliya Mustafina with her large, expressive eyes is to be able to pass as a double-walker for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been comparing with the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
One step higher: This user is the view that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception Actor
Another continuous comparison was drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova shows more than just the sunscreened skin and blonde hair like the actress Annalyn McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was certified by Fans to match an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the similarities
Theory put into the room: According to this user, there may be a reason for the pair's similarity
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the US football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smiles, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney as well as the gold medal winner in the Gabby Douglas tournament, which features her own beautiful, wide smile, similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Commentator for the Olympic Games apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "like a pig has died"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at Dr. 4x200m free swimming table touched viewer of CBC live transmission of the Olympic Games on Wednesday
The Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "done like a thief" and died during the race as "a pig".
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m free swim table.
MacDonald, who was taken to the CBS commenting team on board to give more "color", could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
Excitedly, he went off like a thief, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the swimming table 1:57,79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, which allowed the Canadians to unlock the gap to China.
Visitors across Canada reacted quickly after being shocked by the sound and language
Emmett Macfarlane second, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "how did a pig die?"??
The idiot didn't realize they were still on the show."
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m free swim table for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
Criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came fast and hard, with many talking to him
Twitter users didn't stay back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who moderated the CBC transmission, apologized live for MacDonald's comment and said, "We apologize for the comment about a swimming performance."
It was an unfortunate formulation, and I'm sorry it happened."
CBC finally apologized more than 90 times to the people who responded to the comments on Twitter
Commentary colleague Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and filed his apology with more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also apologized quickly and issued a communication.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that they have been made possible.
We quickly apologized last night to our viewers for sending and our followers in the social media.
To clarify one, Byron's comments refer to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
Yet they were inappropriate and an unfortunate formulation. Byron is doing what he said very sorry.
On Thursday afternoon MacDonald apologized in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's pool in the CBC Olympics," he said.
"I have referred to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course there was no disrespect and I am very sorry."
Buyers in Primark feel about a woman who tastes in the middle of the store naked underwear
The buyers did not know where they should look when a woman pulled their clothes in the middle of a Primark to try underpants.
In order to make the situation worse, she had to look at it, and she pulled it out and put it back into the Regal.
She continued to stifle and tried four pairs of underwear in a shop at Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone.
The Primark shop in Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underwear before she put it back into the regal
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she came back and left the shop without buying anything."
She said, "The people could not believe what they saw."
In the middle of the sales area, she took a few underwear from the exhibition, pulled out her own socks and socks and tried them.
"She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, like Oskar."
"Everyone stared when she pulled out the underwear that she obviously didn't like, because she put them back in the rule."
She repeated the same with three other underpants before she finally decided that she didn't like anything, touched herself again and went out.
"They didn't seem to bother that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who would buy the underwear she had tried under the circumstances."
Mrs. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How reprehensible it would be to think that someone would take underwear with them at home, who had another person who was not washed."
The event took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs. Davidson added: "As I got along, the employees tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after she went - what's so good."
"I'd hate to go home with a new pair of underwear and find out that another woman grabbed them and pulled them out again and they weren't washed."
A spokesperson for Primark said: "Prmark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, August 9 in our branch in Folkstone."
All the products in question were withdrawn from the sale.
How to Protect Yourself From Gun Attacks With Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a major master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a close distance.
Whether you are facing from the front or the back, this video will show you how to turn the spear for your thief.
If you get close to you from the back, then you should turn around as the first one so you can see your attacker and "get out of the shooting line," says Mizrachi.
Then grab the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting him with your free elbow.
Put the weapon out of his hand, and hit him with the knee and move back and forth while the attacker bends over before pain.
When attackers approach from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shooting line, grab the weapon and turn it around, so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time move the weight to the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the weapon out of his grip before they move back and point the weapon towards him.
Does it sound difficult?
Look at the video to see exactly how Mizrachi works.
But remember that it is safe to hand over your money in a robbery - if you are not a maga master.
Traveler Ian Wright uses his tongue for a guide in the most dirty places in Europe
A British traveler underwent a serious test of his immune system and immune system, revealing some of Europe's most dirty and disgusting places.
The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk burned his train on a Euro-Schain, a land at Piccadilly Circus, a wash button for a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of his immune system.
Before revealing each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he will commit himself to.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprising results to light.
The idea of removing the wash button from a toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be totally repulsive, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Luckily, he left nothing that he had revealed, more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright was known for testing the resistance of his belly by traveling through the world and eating peculiar and wonderful things.
From public areas at railway stations to washbasins of toilets, the task of setting his immune system definitively under test
In the film, he said, "I was already quite worried about my health as a child, and I have stuck all possible things in my mouth, earth, worms and sludge."
In the film, he got his call anyway.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His test range showed a number of luminometers of more than 4000 units.
Compared to this, the number of luminometers of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to relax after its number of luminometers over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands had less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of Valio dairy products produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the movie, he says, "This is the worst thing I've ever smoked in a toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not gonna put anything in here because it's stupid inside here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of milk products Valio.
Mr. Wright and Mr. Valio Gefilus are taking place, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something fascinating to look at and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
We were conducting crazy brainstorms that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that the interest in intestinal health will become a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is connected to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the film's director, added: "Let me say it like that - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had leaked some of the things I'd told him to lick like the stupid Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, there were things that made it easier to bring Ian to lay them down and others where this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we've taken some of these dirty treats to film."
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84% of all milk acid bacteria surveyed in particular with the well-being of the stomach and intestines and 58% said that they used at least occasionally products containing added milk acid bacteria.
Asocial family destroys social housing in Saltash, Cornwall
An associative family left her social home after a divorce with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were cast after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were violently removed from their estate, shocked employees of the housing company found the property in an irreparable state.
The walls showed cracking holes, wooden parts were torn apart, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared on the walls.
The family has been relocated and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she feared that the apartment would no longer be repaired.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people don't have to live like this.
There are many things to consider, as this property is probably seen as not so beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family is famous and her name is also.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment for the time being and the police said that the terror that had added to the family included street fights with baseball fighters, bullies of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive shouting, fighting and fleeing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease agreement, received an anti-social order in June.
In some rooms of the house, which will be destroyed under circumstances, old trash has been found
In the case of drugs in the past, the wood parts were torn apart
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and had to call the police regularly
Cornwall Housing delogated her and her partner violently this week from the estate after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to withdraw voluntarily.
Declaration was welcomed by the relieved neighbours who said that their lives were made hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we say to the police here are incredible.
"This morning we couldn't sleep."
We stood up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it'll be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighborhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said it would have failed to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
On the overhauled side of the community house, garbage and old toys were thrown down
He added: "It is a shame that the landlord failed to accept any responsibility for his conduct and that of his family, as a delegation is always the last step that Cornwall Houseing takes into account.
This was a very difficult case, since the conduct was extreme and their actions had to be terribly taken into account for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, Devon and Cornwall police have done, as well as members of the community who have courageously accessed us and let us have the information.
I hope that this development will bring comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left in one of the bedroom of the house after declaration on the ground
Houseworkers will now have to clear up müllbergs surrounding the house
In 2014, the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as wagons, paraphernalia and cash of £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she had become aware of the possession of a class B drug for commercial purposes.
She claimed that the money for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the rooms of the house were decorated with graffiti.
The police say they'll delogate tenants who don't stick to the house.
Angela Crow from the Devon and Cornwall police told us that the denunciation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the house rules.
"This is for those who think they can take action without self-destruction and those who have been damaged by such conduct," she said.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour, which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal transferred to Panik after a deep-flight military jet crossing the beach
Solarists in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion aircraft of the Air Force dropped an incredible crash flight
The Air Force reported that it was on a training flight, but insisted that no safety risk was proposed.
This was the moment when frightened tourists began to panic after a deep - flying jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost in reachable proximity to the sunsets on the beach section of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped up when they obviously began to worry about the noise of the thunderstorms without first seeing what happened to them through the clouds.
The event happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many vacationers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly-By in the social media, said: "It really flew over very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would collapse."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing, and it felt like the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were displaced in panic when the plane came from the dark and incredibly deep flight
The Portuguese Air Force reported today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats ahead of the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to identify them.
The speaker said that due to the poor visual conditions, the jet was a little deeper than the usual flight, but the air forces insisted that safety had not been compromised at any time.
Area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, where four people also died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force reported today that the pilot had to fly so deep because of the conditions - strong fog and smoke - which restricted his view
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with worries over Seville
Seville - The FC Barcelona fights for the first step in the first title win on Sunday in the new football season.
The Catalans join in the duel around the Spanish Supercup outside against the FC Seville, the play goes back three days later in Camp Nou.
The double winner has to give up on Neymar, among other things, with the subordinate Cup Finalist and the ruling European League Champion, who is fighting the Olympic football tournament with Brazil.
There is also a lack of Goalie Marc-Andre on the steps.
In the training, the German undergoes a tape dive in the knee, which explains the question of Barca at least first in favour of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing in Barcelona for two years for the status of number one.
Coach Luis Enrique so far refused to make a clear decision and left Bravo in the league, but for that, Ter Stegen in most other applications took the lead.
Before the first mandatory game of the new game time, the Spanish master has doubts about the fitness status of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a test game by Liverpool with 0:4.
Also at 3:2 in the trial camp against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. did not really know how to convince.
Sevilla, in turn, has to endure the 2:3 defeat after an extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and strives for the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona has so far achieved eleven record winners in this competition.
Ma Long in a own league for table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic winner.
On Thursday in Rio de Janeiro, the 27-year-old beat his countryman and "title defender" Zhang Jike 4:0 (12,5,4,4) in a one-sided final.
Thus the world rankings first won the Golden Grand Slam with success at WM, World Cup, World Tour final tournament and Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese have created it as expected in the final game and have become the title of each other.
It was clear that for the third time in a row, a Chinese would get the single title in the sign of the five rings.
The last non-Chinese at the top of the Olympic stage was the former SVS-NÖ Legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang had left on the record alone, between the sets and at time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had retreated to the Tribune and left their guards alone in the fair competition.
"The matches so far have I played for my country."
"At the end I'm playing for me," Zhang said consecutively.
After the party, gold and silver medal winners with the Chinese flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly unilateral.
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
Then he determined the tempo on the record and left Zhang only 13 points out there.
Due to Ma's superiority, the expected match did not develop.
However, they were not able to see enough stunning ball changes.
Mizutani won the bronze game against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
In his quarter final against the German European Master Dimitrij Ovtcharov, the white Russian had been injured, was then in medical treatment, had to "at last" enjoy blech.
The Swedish Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) have also become a similar high table tennis player Olympia fourth.
Donald Trump solves ′′great problems ′′ in the election struggle
The leaders of the U.S. republics are being urged by massive concerns, including in traditional conservative states, to harm their majority.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the former Republican Hochburg Utah.
A rare moment in which the normally large-scale and self-evident multi-millionaire expressed such concerns as correspondents reported.
After he threw 16 rivals into his own Republican camp, the doubts about his success in the fight for the White House grew.
"We have great problems in Utah," said Trump in front of evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Guilt was false reports about his candidacy, he took up his well-known media record again.
Roofing of Republican castles
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a survey of SurveyUSA in June, Trump and his rival from the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were on the same footing.
Other institutions are looking forward to Trump, but not at the distance usual for Republican candidates in the Federal State.
Arizona and Georgia are also in danger.
In an interview with the broadcaster CNBC, Trump answered the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton's first march again: "Just like I've done before."
And push back: "This will either be successful, or I will make a very nice, long holiday".
He does nothing but "tell the truth".
If it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, then be fine, Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump party should have threatened to raise funds to support its election campaign, it should not be able to present better survey values.
Instead, you want to strengthen the candidates for the Congress of Republicans.
Olympia: Dreister fraud at Doping Test
The IOC intends to set up a disciplinary commission in this case.
Kenya's Light Athletics threatens after the second doping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro Ungameach.
After an attempted fraud at a doping check in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee was informed to set up an immediate disciplinary committee to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had reported that the former sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, in the Olympic village had given a urine sample under the name of the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported by the Kenyan Team Leadership of the Doping Controllers.
The IAAF World Association asked the IOC for information on the case in order to conduct its own investigations, an IAAF spokesperson told.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the following IOC measures will be evaluated by the IAAF," said an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and was released as Ferguson Rotich, who handed out the test and signed it," said Kenya's Chief of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who was on the list for the training checks of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich became over 800 meters in 2015 in Beijing World War II.
Four days earlier, the Kenyan lightweight athletics chief Michael Rotich was withdrawn from the Rio games.
He is supposed to have informed against payments by athletes in his country about upcoming doping tests.
According to media reports, he should have been arrested on his return to Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under particular observation for a long time after numerous doping offences at the IOC.
The announcement of more than 2000 doping targets before the Rio Games by the IOC indicated that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are being brought into sight.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had exerted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the Olympics began.
As a result, WADA Kenya took from the list of countries whose doping fights are in accordance with WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a major running nation.
The country's light athletes won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
In a series of ARD television reports, allegations have been repeated that doping media is easily accessible in Kenya and that there should be a significant mentality of sport fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently requested a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had hired in the Russian light athletics.
It could be demonstrated that this type of sport has been systematically and superficially absorbed.
Russia's light athletes were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festivals present the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, like Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leonard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic leader Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of the classic and fulfilled the role of Mary as a youth.
In the orchestra dig the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the venisonal conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he sings.
We always say that she is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and their melody.
It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I'd say we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this scene Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She fondly remembers her love for Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First, because it is musically exceptional!
And then there would still be Mary's personality.
She says in her song, "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and white and bright".
So she's smart, of course also naive, and very passionate.
"She looks very much like me, like my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honor for us to work with her.
She's a very generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You can see it in every movement, in his eyes, it's his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a happy approach to life, which is at all very important!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly topical: "In this piece it is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have refugees, then the Puerto Ricans have gone to New York, and the New Yorkers did not want them.
They are the same topics, and they are as powerful today as they were then.
59 years later the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirls who joined the IS were killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the IS, died according to reports in Syria.
Lawyer Tasneme Akunjee said that her family experienced her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air attack in Raqqa, the group's bowling plant in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died shortly after she planned to leave the war - torn country and return to England.
"You can only hope that the only good is in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - people should refrain from ever making this decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015 Sultana and two other girls from East London entered a plane towards Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was informed that she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and was widowed within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will remain a candidate for the Supreme Court in the event of a victory in Garland
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland's confirmation since its appointment by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader in Senator Mitch McConnell is of the opinion that the next president will appoint Antonin Scalia as the successor of the deceased judge at the Supreme Court.
Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to select Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".
A speaker from Reid later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and speculate.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team wouldn't worry about a new candidate.
Garland is the chief judge of the U.S. Appeals Court for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked Garland's nomination, were lakaies and assistants of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also found that Donald Trump was inappropriate for the president's office.
Treats wants a naked calendar for "women and for men"
The Treats magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to produce a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Museum Calendar for 2017.
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us early this year that his naked magazine was different from Oldschool-Playboys, since "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently he thinks the calendar's doing it too.
"We must return to the representation of timeless and classic nakedness, in which both women and men feel well and are inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release for publication of the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful artwork.
Models can submit their images online or personally at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish municipality with mass flight
"He who does not adapt and praise Erdogan sits on packed suitcases," says President of the Golden-Near Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun.
In the short term, the Kurdish municipality of Germany has tens of thousands of defence seekers who fled from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even become "a few hundred thousand", says Ali Toprak, president of the association.
Due to the harsh treatment of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects a mass escape to Germany.
"In the short term, I count with ten thousand, in the medium term with a few hundred thousand Turkish defence seekers, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition," says Ali Toprak, the "world" of Friday.
Because the government had already overrun Kurdish capitals with criminal offences months ago, 500,000 Kurds were on the run within Turkey.
Even secular and oppositional ethnic Turks are coming to an end after the abandoned Putsch.
Many will want to start again in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey.
"It can't be that a state that owns refugees is producing refugees in its own country," Toprak said.
The head of the association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish but also in Alevitian cities.
This will increase Erdogan's output pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or dispersed in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The head of the association demanded that the federal government "as sharp as Austria is against Erdogan and its supporters".
In Germany too, a "Hexenjagd" against Erdogan critics takes place.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.
The German branch of the Golden Movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition.
The branding as a gold pendant destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.
"He who does not adapt and praise Erdogan sits on packed suitcases, including the Chemalists and secularists," said Ercan Karakoyun, President of the Golden-Near Foundation Dialogue and Education, "the world".
As reported in the newspaper on numbers of the Federal Ministry of Interior, the Turks have already presented the largest group of asylum-seekers in Germany who have been recognized for political persecution.
On June 30, this was 11,386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all asylum seekers (39,625).
In this survey, there are no refugees from war, poverty or impetuousness.
Asylum rights under the Basic Law are strictly political, i.e. on the part of the State, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurts"
Rare Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals get nothing from the summer election struggle with - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia cannot choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
2021 will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Swedish Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because more blood than ever is not going: summer holidays, heat and country day campaign - that's what it's all about.
The locals who should be convinced by the voters are on holiday.
Most vacationers who are in the country are not local on the road to Usedom, Rügen or Hidden Lake, so they must not choose the land day.
Practical problems include: In the holidays there are helpers who hang the posters, blow up air balloons, distribute flyers and count votes at the end, just to drive hard.
Until September 4, 2016, on the election and last holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has yet to pass election battles on to the people.
The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.
And it is also something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
It will be exciting how strong Neuling AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 government chief, makes an almost inexhaustible election struggle, you look away from his big posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and spreads a little with the people, as did his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff.
Otherwise, Seeling has received cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the flowering of the AfD.
Her refugee policy, "We create this", has accelerated the rise of law enforcement officers, which will probably now cost him the beautiful office.
The CDU with its top candidates, Interior Minister Lorenzo Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to fight in the right place at the wrong time.
She has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel twice to major events; Merkel Bundestagsvohlkreis is located in the northeast.
But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliners and Sachsen there as Mecklenburgers and prepommers.
"There was probably the majority from other federal countries," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it doesn't hurt anyone from other corners of Germany, even Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely ignores the usual election stand in marketplaces and in front of shopping centres with sunscreens and air balloons.
That, Kokert says, only plays a "subordination" role.
The Union has also noted that on the ground, you are wasting away the foundation that it must make a great effort to find a thread for the people.
You go like the left, the SPD, the green: there is hardly any place in the country.
However, the advice of the CDU voter Kokert to his opponent is also self-defeated: "You have to go where it hurts, where people are: Villages, Golden Weddings, every birthday party must be used."
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election struggle.
In the polls, the Social Democrats last stood 22 percent behind a partner CDU (25) and only shortly before the AfD (19).
At the 2011 election, the SPD had clearly gained 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).
The Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, were allowed to make the jump in the country day.
They make the holiday emergency a modern virtue and place their election campaign largely on the Internet.
"Online election campaign," he calls the president of the country Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, there are green voters looking for local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, bends right with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lake and finds it still beautiful.

B27 Sanitation: Guests suffer under lockdown
At the speed at which the B 27 is repaired, there is nothing to interfere with.
For those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends only at 8:00 p.m., there is all praise.
"They've made everything pretty crazy," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet station.
That's a super team.
There's no delay either.
At the beginning of the week, the building could be moved to the south by the end of October.
It is also promised that the persons responsible for the construction work will be met, for example, when it comes to the establishment of aid supplies.
Since the construction site has moved to the south on Monday and also the closure of the Aspergstraße has been lifted in Otterdingen and thus the connection to Rottenburg has been restored, the traffic situation within the place has relaxed.
The citizens can now get rid of wastes from the B27 on the other hand.
The departure through the place seems to be going back.
"There were some significant complaints," says the Deputy Chief Executive Officer, Florian King, responsible for the transport management of the repair.
The inhabitants of Bachsatstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many trails were looking for and rather trusted in their navi than the sign.
This led to some trucks crashing into residential areas.
In the absence of compliance with the speed limits, the municipality urged the vehicle to increase from Mössingen.
"There were significant oversteps," says King, who made himself aware of the situation on the spot.
There have been two to three hours of lightning.
The fastest was traveling with 77 hours in the tempo-30 zone.
Since the construction site has been moved on, it has become more quiet.
For the business people on the B 27 it is only a small comfort that the street is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Business people don't like looking at the cards.
But that the B 27 sanitation has led to sales disruptions, everyone who is asked will be able to see.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
Whoever has less to do with the "end customer" so produces for other companies, for which the repair has little consequences.
Also at the Autohaus Maier Thomas Sulz speaks of a "highest slight decline", but also admits that of course "the driving skills are missing".
The locals are most appreciated along the street.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, for instance Krone, finds clear words.
This is already a threat to existence.
Not only him, but all the guesthouses have hit it "hard".
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be happy about every euro revenue.
It refers to "over 50 percent" revenue.
Road rehabilitation has "refused its operation for two years".
Half of his employees had to be released.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half would have been released, politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, Government President Jörg Schmidt replied to a request from Göhner for financial compensation, stating that the guesthouse would benefit otherwise from the benefits of the situation in the B27. Now she would also have to bear the benefits of the repair.
Greeder knows of other country circles, where something so generous has been handled.
In all complaints, Gohner is confident that his guest will continue to exist.
Finally, since 1715 the family business has been here, it points to the long history.
The fact that other family guests now overlook less often because of the complicated traffic management can be understood.
If you can't get out, it's nice everywhere.
That his family client returns after the end of the renovation work, Göhner has no doubt about it.
Despite the crisis with BSE and bird flu, Göhner holds the impact of the B 27 construction works on his knowledge of the biggest crisis he has experienced in his long history.
Six months of building, that's already brutal.
Laws are constantly being scrapped in the name of the fight against terrorism.
After the recent attacks, the Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick safety package.
But what does a state of tolerance have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all that?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciliation.
All his proposals are "politically accessible" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of Interior when presenting his new security package.
They're not exaggerating anyone.
Other further points would first be discussed within the parties.
I'm also involved in this.
However, as a minister of the interior, he had results and a "successful consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière has allowed a little time to be spent before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But they are now more extensive.
Some things are already known, announced, pointed out: that a new security authority should take care of the breach of encrypted communications is not new.
Nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU provisions on aviation data and arms law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizière launches a second call for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to put a campaign of sympathy for terrorist groups under penalties and to cut off the German passport with dual citizenship.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man admits.
He still considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that the coalition partner has no chance at all.
A few new ideas also present de Maizière.
They have it partly within themselves: He plans rapid procedures for detachment and more opportunities for arresting people before detachment.
Refugees who are being picked up in the country should first check their smartphones and reveal social media accounts for a security check.
In the case of tolerances for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately discard their papers to conceal their identity.
Some of these are politically and legally weak.
Some still seem uneducated and open up questions.
And in some respects - for example, in the case of the unequal treatment of patients - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terrorism.
But it cannot be said in Abrede that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, in view of the high numbers of refugees, many people were concerned about security.
And things that people were deeply engaged in could not even get out of hand in election times.
The internal security is extremely focused.
Only the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The insurance's big.
And yes, there are elections.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly concerned with internal security.
In the past few days, there has been a rise between the two parties.
Only a heated dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then about a security policy idea collection of some Union ministers, in which the headquarters also calls for a Burka ban and a withdrawal from the dual state citizenship.
De Maizière is also trying here to make reconciliation.
From a turn away from the double pass, he doesn't hold anything.
We have freed the discussion in Germany.
Don't make any sense to reopen them.
And in a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is a constitutional party at all corners and whether it is actually "approachable" for the coalition partner, must only be shown.
There's something in there that can make a difference.
However, the SPD is also currently trying to profile itself on the issue of internal security.
SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security.
The Volkswagen is still going through a lot.
Despite diesel candals, delivery numbers are increasing worldwide.
But not all markets run around.
In the case of the feedback, there is a dizziness about a term.
Volkswagen starts delivery of behaviors in the second half of the year.
Europe's largest car manufacturer can still offer a plus in the course of the past year, despite its many brands and some well-running markets.
In July, however, the VW’s core brand weakened, especially in Western Europe, and thus charged the total sales again, as reported by the company noted in Dax.
The brand VW sold worldwide in July with 449100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous month.
Only in Western Europe, after China's second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous month.
In the home market in Germany, deliveries dropped by almost one sixth.
Brand sales chief Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker figures from July to two days less in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets, 'changed economic conditions' have led to a buy-back.
In addition to the situation surrounding Turkey's coup attempt, the British vote has also been forced to leave the EU, one speaker explained.
In the United States, where the exhaust business first escalated, there is also a minus to book.
Large support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected household brand of the Low Saxonys is still muzzled by the diesel candal: after the first seven months, only 0.9 percent of the delivery is available to 3.37 million vehicles.
From January to July, Group Sales Manager Fred Kappler was able to present a further sale.
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time, worldwide 5,904 million.
Volkswagen had manipulated a software exhaust test.
In Germany alone, VW calls about 2.5 million cars for refurbishment in the workshops.
During the refurbishment, VW confirmed that the refurbishment of the cars had no negative effects.
After the refurbishment of vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
The autobuilder submits a "guarantee-like" certificate to the customer after refurbishment, but does not speak of a "guarantee", as it was called on Friday in corporate circles.
Legal fines are ground.
The focus had reported that Volkswagen gave its German customers a guarantee for refurbished diesel models.
This would have been confirmed by VW representatives at the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting.
"VW has the task of fully fulfilling the tasks of my investigation commission and the KBA."
"Deviations from this are not accepted," said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the Ministry.
VW has taken the guarantee that no deterioration will occur in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after refurbishment and that all relevant vehicle approval values have remained unchanged.
Volkswagen himself uses the term "guarantee" but does not use the term "guarantee" as it used to be in business circles.
With the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example, a half-year after refurbishment customers will come to a workshop with motor damage - and this could lead to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important to avoid, in the interest of the customer, any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal, an insurance insurance scheme, as it was called.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantee".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee requires a lot of savings in the future - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank Chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It's only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Giro or Daily Accounts".
The Federal Association of Deutsche Banken speaks of a single case and does not see any sign in it: Normal savers should "not be afraid to pay for their savings".
If banks are to deposit money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they must pay 0.4% of their penalty.
This fee is charged by the Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on Giro or Daily Accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 costs 400 euros a year," said Paul.
He has been guarding 40 million euros from one day to the next, which he could not use.
"They are in my central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of the costs," the bank manager said.
"I can't spend $4,000 for every million."
He will now continue the costs according to the principle of origin.
The cash simply lies in the treasury of the Raiffeisenbank, it would be too dangerous: "I've already experienced four surpluses, I don't like the fifth!" said the Banking Board.
Most customers had understanding and switched to other forms of investment.
Only a few went to other banks.
The Association of Associations Bayern stated: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy rate causes significant costs to all banks".
It is not possible to carry it alone "on a permanent basis".
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for accounting, credit cards or transfers.
With a fine of three million euros for deposits, Thuringian Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its Skatbank branch 2014.
Michael Kemmer, chief businessman of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to pay flat-rate payments for deposits, which is why competition in Germany is far too strong under banks and savings."
One banker said there is "a client who is a bit more resourceful" at Lake Tegern.
"This can become a problem for a small bank," when she saves money for free.
The association bank Gmund, founded in 1911, has branch offices in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
In the region, well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live.
The Bavarian Association of Societies "are currently not known to any other banks that calculate an exposure allowance for deposits of private customers," said Sprecher Ernst.
At the end of June, the president of the Federal Association of German Banks and Raiffeisenbanks (BVR), Uwe Föhlich, had stated: "The threshold for negative towards the private customer is very, very high".
Competition is tough, and it threatens the migration of investors to competition.
The customers in Germany won't like it in the width.
Destination records: who actually buys sound records?
Single men of middle age love records.
Before you listen to the part of the comment to pass it under the pseudonym NotAllUnlike menMiddle age with severe discomfort, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the widely discussed resumption of sound records is not a tree in millenniums that wants to welcome the newness of physical objects, but a result of midlife nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a record are all expected to be between 45 and 54 years old.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
There are also no hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance: older record buyers keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But do you agree with the results of YouGov?
If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I'm running in the middle of a business street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit and playing wild, before I stand, holding my hands and saying something decisive like, "So let's take a closer look at it."
So let's take a look at it.
Even if the heart of Sohos is slow to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers were - there are still hand-in-hand fantastic record shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mood by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (number: two young women, three middle-aged men) to the Reckless Records (number: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around the 20s), is one day because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I appreciate it," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These sound records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I did not follow him home), dressed out the walls of his living room.
The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates he couldn't afford when they appeared and to buy again items he sold when he was young and argued about.
"Many things I buy are from the late '60s, early '70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things where I was probably too young to buy them for me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy the plates are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
That's my joke.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets are meeting on the YouTube profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and who want to see themselves buy their old records again.
From the discussions I have had, people have usually resigned from their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their CDs to buy themselves CDs now sell their CDs to buy themselves again," he says.
This would explain the tree to the followers of the disc revival of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional significance of discs?
It takes just a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record shops offer a relaxing community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers attacked the contactless payment system.
Some album fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of trusted soundboards, from objects that sparked happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of an empty or the possession of material owners as a kind of comfort," says Wez.
It's like a collector with me and I think it's like that with a lot of people.
It is a simple way of dealing mentally.
"We are like their social workers!" a worker floats out of a record pile.
A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month had not yet heard it.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have a record player.
At this time of the report, I would probably look very concerned, while I am getting a stack of Bossa Nova compilations easier.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Data Number: Three Men of Middle Ages), has observed a "trope aspect" of the Revival.
"Someone just came in here recently and said, "I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a radiohead loudspeaker so I can put it in a regatta," he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-related, less musical.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older ones, who come in slowly.
Fopp, who has dedicated the soundboard almost a whole floor, has a more colorful audience than I go in.
There are couples around the 70, tourists who take pictures, teenage boys and women of middle age.
Even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the shops mentioned above - Wild Beast's latest synthetic and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz is draining from the speakers - it's good to see such a diversity with the customers.
None of them seem lonely, but naked mental traumas are hard to detect when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes and is looking at the variety of plates for sale.
She's making a showcase bomb more than a big deal.
She doesn't deserve much, so collecting discs is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It is easy to hear music from a computer or in another way, but the beauty of discs is..." she drives off with a loved one.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I'm giving the appearance of designing the Jeans Hotpants, I watched a group of young teenage girls grouping for a moment to group Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter thought about buying a Crosley record player.
To the left is a staircase, a wall full of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
No one looks at her - perhaps because they are just decorative, some so far up there that it is impossible to touch her.
It's pure "plattenart".
But given that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also those who spend most of their luxury items such as plates.
Even though my research has shown that youGov's results are correct, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in reality, record shops and online forums is not taken into account.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They will certainly not spend their Thursday morning with the booming through the Berwick Street record shops and the leaves through plates, while they avoid the staring look of an mysterious, 30-year-old false moderator who does not push over the shoulders of men of middle age.

French court rejects offer on Abriss of transactions in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has refused an offer from the authorities in Calais to bring down dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
In a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the State should be empowered to dispose of 72 temporary shops in which persons within the camp of goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
Prefecture Calais argued that these places should be destroyed because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a fire and health risk.
Humanitarian groups informed the court that shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the State-supported association and other groups would not provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also argued that temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the designation of persons operating 72 provisional transactions, but admitted that the concerns of Calais's prefecture were "absolutely enforceable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than feeding only people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was threatened by the downfall was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated in general and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure "would be for these children a disaster, of which the youngest are eight years old."
The two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the migrant estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in the number of new arrivals during the summer.
Despite Olympia's disappointment: Martin stays fighting
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic season, Johnny Martin won't be able to get under oath.
"I continue to keep the WM in sight, remain confident and fight," the 31-year-old wrote on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro on Facebook.
He doesn't have an explanation for his miserable twelfth place on the sugar hut.
"I honestly find it difficult to comment on the time of yesterday," Martin said.
He had to analyze in quiet what reasons he had led to the debacle.
In October in Qatar, Martin wanted to fight for the title.
"I'm going to look at everything we've changed lately."
"It also includes my position," wrote the three-time World Cup champion, who had lost more than three minutes on Wednesday at 54.5 km on Olympics Fabian Cancelara (Switzerland).
Olympia: Tennisprofi Siegemund missed half-finals
Laura Siegemund's victory ended at Rio's fourth final: The 32nd World rankings from Metzingen passed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-No.

Group expands on startup for live video game transmissions
Other people watch when playing video games, is a giant trend - of which Microsoft also wants to benefit.
The technology group buys the start-up tree that specializes in this hobby.
How much money goes into the takeover, Microsoft didn't share on Thursday.
Beam started with his offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others while playing, but also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions and confront enemies and provide equipment.
The Playful Activation Blizzard launches a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.

The staff of the start-up, which has so far been based in Seattle, Washington, U.S.A., are moving to Microsoft headquarters in the California Redmond, as Beam Co-founder and Chief Matt Salsamendi announced.
Therefore, the acquisition should not change anything for the customers.
According to Microsoft, Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market for live streaming of video game activities is growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.

Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's racers have to adjust to the next generation of speed meters: in various federal countries, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new flashing devices are tested, which are particularly effective for the transmission of temposinians.
For example, the futuristic Enforcement Trailer of Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used at accident centres where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, on motorway buildings or to repair bridges with temporary tempolimit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary flasher to comply with the speed limit.
A permanent mobile structure, however, can be too dangerous or too costly.
The Enforcement Trailer is autarch: His battery holds for five days in continuous measurement operation, the case data will be transmitted via a modem.
With laser measuring technique, all vehicles can be recorded via multiple tracks at the same time.
Variable speed limits as well as travel bans by hour, driving ranges and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In high-risk mode you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with any car with trailer coupling.
In order not to be easily chewed, it is lowered in the measuring plant, so that the wheels disappear in the armored and also protective outer shells.
In addition, a built-in alarm system should protect the lightning from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested and used in various federal countries according to Vitronic's data.
Also foreign authorities shine with the new technology: France recently ordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
Britain takes silver in the 7th Rugby after Fiji Masterclass takes gold
The impressive performance of Britain at the 7th Rugby finally came to an abrupt stop on Thursday evening at the last stop in the form of Fiji when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium.
Fiji awarded a master class in handling, side-stepping, back, line running and raw strength to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad comfort price of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear downfall of the boxes, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall on them in the final.
But regardless of this, Fiji would have hit a 15-man team in the best shape.
It could be a comfort for GB - but it probably won't - that at least one British gold medal will have hung around his neck tomorrow: Fiji Head Coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult path behind him.
Eight years ago they lost every game under Ryan at the Adelaide Sevens.
There's only one thing they lost.
This sleep is going to hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji began wonderfully and let the attacks of GBs slip out of the fun.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and Co., it felt as if you would run in running buses. The World Series winners went up 5-0 when Ocean Collinsau crossed the corner.
With four more minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he turned.
12-0 and GB barely took the ball.
A magnificent peak of Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leon Nakarawa to reach a third gate, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua made a touchdown in the right corner and stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the rerunpfiff and there was still over a minute game time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou insisted on further weaknesses of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a door.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the pause.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning about it.
That's how it is.
GB made fundamental changes in half-time and closed the Fijian gap...for four minutes, which was good for the first half-time conditions until Joshua Tuisova went through a brilliant interplay of Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was long in favour of the South Sea islands, whose fans sang, flagged and danced on the Tribune.
It wasn't hard to admire Fiji's playful approach.
Mata Viliame placed the i-tupplechen with another attempt in the last few seconds.
The pfiff detonated, the Fijis hugged and GB looked destructively beat into the races.
Earlier on the day, Fiji Japan had won the 20-5 semi-final and Great Britain had pushed South Africa into a short semi-final match from the race - UK conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the box forward in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the line with an impressive footwork and reached a door below the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late pickling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the coach to win the row
There will be no more emotional gold than in these games and that's what it means.
From the first blow to the last, 220 hard hives that entered the history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though it was only the two who sat on the ruder, there were three voices in the boat. The Echo of Coach Robin Williams, was everywhere when they followed the second Olympic gold in the Two without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sports who set such a scale.
Her dominance was absolutely, however, her 39th unbeatable use, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes who wander across the surface with the elegance of dogs, which does not fully reflect the type of triumph.
Behind every gold in the rudern is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and there was no one more helpful than the coach who did not know if he would survive this day at all than cancer was diagnosed with him.
Like he said, he's risky.
I had bladder cancer, which is operable, and they did.
If you don't, he'll spread out everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the perspective a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The Trio was lucky that he could begin his treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if it was the right term in such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and went around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
Raising is already a challenge, but it makes it even bigger.
In the instant of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking with him something more than anything else and trying to deal with his own fears.
Stanning, who was the main man in the Royal Artillery Regiment in an action in Afghanistan, said "I was an emotional wreck this week. That may be something extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much it means to me how much Helen and Robin have worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anybody, so a lot of thanks goes to him. He's the best coach in the world.
I wouldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not cope.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to settle, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught at the moment.
Helen called "remain in the process, stay in the process".
It is really important not to be distracted.
We had a good start, and at the same time we weren't meant to do something great.
We didn't want a fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, get out and win the race, what we did.
The couple will take a while for a year before it will make decisions about its future.
Glover has to appear next week at a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to understand that I was an Olympic girl.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes.
That feels so much better," she said.
31 years of exemplary care for clarity
The manager of the Water Management Association "Veitensteingruppe", Ruppert Göller, is going to rest.
The association is regarded as "beyernwide exemplary".
A small French beverage water supply association as an example for large water producers.
So it was in the original tone some time ago in a contribution of the Bavarian radio.
A little later, the water forum of the government of sub-franchines honored the association of purposes.
The work of the Weitensteingruppe is considered "by far as exemplary".
Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who was a member of the association for 31 years, 28 years as manager.
Now he was adopted in retirement at the age of 65.
The drinking water association of the Veitensteingruppe with its seat in Kottendorf, Breitbrunn municipality, promotes about 150000 cubic metres of water each year and provides 32 places and Weiler with around 5500 inhabitants.
Memberships are the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
For more cities and cities there are water supply contracts.
The current president, Breitbrunn's Mayor Gertrude Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed Water Wart in 1985 and was already appointed manager of the Association in 1988.
"Its tasks have been very diverse and they have ranged from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities, budget planning, charging of fees and contributions to emergency payments to weekends," the president said.
She called the launch and opening of new sources (1994), land purchases in the field of new sources (1998) and the compensation of farmers, the repair of high containers (1999), the re-establishment of central computer control (2004) and the refurbishment of water pipelines.
There has been no silence and innovations have been repeated, because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her Laudatio she praised Göllers for their faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He used a lot of heart blood for his water supply and he lived the water supply as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the concept of success of the weightsteingruppe for nitrate reduction before the water forum of the district of subfranken.
For this he received a lot of recognition and praise.
Rupert Göller, on the other hand, praised waterwart Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best waterguard and he was a faithful button.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
As a highlight in his view, he described the well-building and restructuring of the association.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use, however, were the tube break on the high container at Churchlauter on January 3.
There will have to work all night long at minus 17 degrees so that the villages can be provided with water.
The maintenance of Neubrunn has also been maintained only once, because it filled Pettstadt’s high tank with hoses.
The management of the Drinking Waters Association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who follows Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko opens up with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents: "They must have the courage to talk about it."
"The medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the disease was recognized by her son, she believed she had to die.
In the meantime, the eight-year-old Tiago has come forward well and is now learning privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: If I ask him something that lies behind two years when I sing at the Milan Scala, he remembers nothing," Netrebko said.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with the bassbariton Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship State in Bargeheide - Man shoots at life's danger
A 35-year-old man shot his partner in a multi-family house in Bargeheide (Kreis Stormmarn) on Friday at 10.45 a.m. and killed her.
"The man called on us himself and told us to have shot his life partner," said one police spokesman.
The killer's on the run. He's gonna be caught in public.
Sven S. could be on his way by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters big, muscley, burning and has a smooth.
Meanwhile, the police have published a photo of him.
However, it is a few years old.
In the meantime, the man wears a plate.
The man should not be contacted directly.
He could still carry the gun with him, so the police.
Anyone who sees Sven S. should call 110.
The police are talking about a "State of Relations".
The victim was in 1988, the offender in 1981.
The competent police in Lübeck initially did not want to make any information about the killing or the relationship between the offender and the victim; however, they confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It's a murder crime."
"We're not saying any more at the moment," said a police spokesman in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a special application command (SEK) was at the scene.
Steel - Lighting for the German steel industry
The crisis-stricken and energy-intensive German steel industry remains exempt from additional costs in millions.
Financial pressures that threatened the sector from the eco-strom supply are from the table.
It remains in the liberation of renewable energy from the so-called own-power production plants in the German steel industry, says Federal Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "West German General Newspaper" (WAZ, Free Edition).
"I'm really glad that we could finally reach this after two years of closer negotiations."
The European Commission had therefore first planned to ask steel producers to use the gas from the high power plant to produce electricity for their own consumption.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of between EUR 120 million and EUR 240 million per year.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a principle agreement with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vetager.
Only if the generators are replaced in the steelworks will an EEC conversion of 20 per cent.
However, these will not be raised in the steel industry either.
The IG Metal welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on own-flow production.
Thus the status quo of the previous regime is largely determined.
Gabriel's successful efforts in the steel industry are of particular importance.
"With regard to our campaign 'Steel is Future', this is a first step."
"More must follow."
"Climate and employment objectives are also to be taken into account in the reform of emissions trading," said IG Metal Chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and significant price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.
Last year, the situation continued to worsen when the world's largest producer country in China threw massive steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.
European producers propose price dumping to Chinese steel companies.
During this spring the situation has relaxed somewhat.
On the one hand, the import duties imposed on imports of steel have had an effect, and on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have become brighter.
It is unclear how sustainable the price relaxation is.
The German industry premium Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Finally, prices would have stagnated again.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Tyssenkrupp did not wish to exclude the closures of individual works.
At the end of 2015, about 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry.
In July, German steel producers remained cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
With 3.4 million tonnes they produced well six percent less crude steel than in the previous month, as the Economic Association announced on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced was now falling back in the second month.
Since the beginning of the year, production is below the previous year's value by two percent.
The association will be counting in the coming months thanks to an improved ordering position with an increasing emissions.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singing good to seniors
The song has already accompanied Ursel Kipp her whole life: as a young girl she was in school, in the teacher's studio she placed music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a test, she feels balanced, happy and all alive, she says.
In addition, she does something good for her health and her mind.
Because Singing is from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler of the German Seniors.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of the music with equals, says Hackler.
Through regular aggregation, seniors can bond and maintain social contacts.
Because social and family structures often break up at age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "To agree and organize to rely on others and to learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of reconciliation".
Singing can be challenging in the positive sense, says hacker.
Because seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
He who regularly demands his lungs does not drive out of the rush every day.
Even if it is about getting the sound of the voice at an age, singing is an optimal hobby.
On older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Community of Senior Organizations.
In the older generations, the common song had a much higher place value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, demented people themselves derive themselves from long-standing events.
In singing, a special performance is also required for the head, says Lenz.
At the same time, concentrate on your own voice and on a prescribed rhythm and adapt to other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Just older people who live alone practice not only to focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition experienced by singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The feeling of self-worth is also growing through the singing in the choir.
To show myself: If I practice for a long time, I will get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.
So there are good reasons to start with the song.
Whoever wants to try a new hobby shouldn't hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, says Lenz.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who listens when a sound goes up?
Looking for the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone from the acquaintance circle sings in a senior choir, you can just join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the auditorium in the surrounding area.
Anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the congregation or to the head of the church.
Many seniors are also found on the Internet.
Anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help in Internet search.
Whoever wants to sing should definitely join a choir, Hackler said.
Singing does good to the soul and has something liberating - that applies to every age.
Cats react more sensitive than the cat to the cries of the young animals
Biologists in Hannover have examined the effect of calling cats on adult animals.
To their surprise, the Mioen also allowed the men not to be cold - however, they remained in the same position as the women.
Female cats can detect the level of breeding of cats at the mioen of the little ones.
They react ten percent faster to the sound of cats who are in great need, as scientists from the Animal Medical University and the Medical University Hannover (MHHH) have discovered.
Kater also reacts to the calls of cats - however, always the same.
"It is obvious that the acoustic differences between the mioen of less and strong-educated young animals for men are either not noticeable or not significant," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the length and height of the cat’s wings differ with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult catheters and eight cats from the MHH animal maintenance were observed.
You were expected to receive a call from little ones who were taken out of the trash can for three minutes and who were separated from their mothers and siblings.
On the other hand, they were faced with cries of stronger raised cats.
The researchers hold their results strong despite the small sample.
"All women, even those who had not yet had their own adult, responded differently to the cry," Konerding said.
They turned to the speaker more quickly when this call of the most noble cats played.
This ability may be born or developed with gender maturity.
"It was a surprise that the men had reacted at all," the biologists said.
In the past, scientists have studied the reactions of women and men to baby noise many times in humans.
Some studies also showed that women responded more sensitively to infants, whether they were mothers or not, according to biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski grip with "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan Sugar is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant was issued against the infamous Hakan Sugar Football Star.
He is proposed to be a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the Putsch trial, an important football game will take place in Turkey.
Before the duel of the Erzrivalen between Beziktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski's Galatasary Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is said.
As soon as the state of emergency was suspended after the attack in July, the government considered that the daily life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
However, this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gulen, who is responsible for the torture trial.
It is also not held in front of the football.
Against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükür, the state prosecutor issued a warrant.
Thereafter, it is proposed to the sugar currently living in America to be a member of a terrorist group.
Sugar is to be the trailer of the preacher Fethullah Gulen, who is made responsible by the president of the state Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the Putsch test.
Although the emergency condition for the first 90 days still applies until October, in fact it has no effect on the life of most Turks as well as no impact.
The nightly "Democracy Watch" in public places throughout the country explained Erdogan for the end on Wednesday.
Sport is – like the whole country – divided into supporters and opponents of the earth.
Especially fans of the Workers' Club visit are traditionally not among the President's friends.
What unites the Great of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict refusal of military puppets.
Even the fans agree - no matter whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or visits.
At Pokalwier "Gala", it will come back to Lukas Podolski in particular.
His sporting value was demonstrated by the Colognen in the past season: With 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old ended his first playing time as the top scorer of his association.
In the final match against Fenerbahce he won the 1:0 victory.
The newspaper "Fanatik" delighted him: "He was the best in the place."
He completed the season in an excellent way and secured the podal for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the recordmaster found a reconciliation conclusion.
After the first round-K.o in the Champions League, the "Lews" also separated early in the Europa League.
In the Super Light it only reached grade six.
The season wasn't good.
The pod was the only way to win something.
"We have done this and this is the most important," Podolski said.
For Master Visits, the game year was better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the foundation for the 14th title as a Super-Lig-Torschützen king with 26 season meetings.
That is also why the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
In doing so, the Gomez who was under contract with the AC Florence and who was only loaned to Besiktas had announced after the coup attempt not to return to the political situation in the country after his EM vacation.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," quoted the magazine "Kicker" Club Chief Fikret Orman.
But the stormer had to be willing to give up about one third of his annual salary estimated at EUR 7.5 million, Orman made it clear: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence".
Despite Doping: These athletes still have medals at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already detained twice for doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa must not start in Rio.
Other handy athletes can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals.
The theme of Doping is still ahead of the battle lines at the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who had applied for her right of initiation shortly before the games after a doping-block, was no longer scratched and exploded at her start (100 meters breast).
It offered a scurry scenario: With a smile set she was still proud in the hall and had provoked with her appearance.
When she said she wasn't gonna get any gold, the audience broke into a jubilee storm.
However, there are still many other athletes who, despite the Doping past of the Olympic Games in Rio, will start.
Here's an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100 m staff/USA): The 34-year-old is among the most controversial figures in light athletics.
He was already detained twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his band, the 2004 Olympic winner and former world champion have even faster than before, he is more than 100 m in 9.80 seconds the number one of the world and is considered the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m staff/Jamaica): The double Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to leave a six-month barrier in 2010 after receiving the painkiller oxycodon.
She had severe dental pain after surgery, defended the 29-year-old.
Sandra Perkovic (Discus/Croatia): In 2011, the 2012 Olympic winner, World Champion from 2013 and European champion from 2010 to 2016 were tested positively on the forbidden Stimulans medium Methylhexanamine.
Perkovic contests the scientific intake and has been blocked for six months.
The four largest throws this year go to the account of the great gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-Stafffel/USA): The Beijing Olympic winner and two-time world champion over 400 m, was tested in 2010 and was closed for 21 months.
A means of penis enlargement has been responsible for merritt.
This year the 30-year-old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m.
Ivan Tichon (hammer's throw, Belarus): Well, hardly one athlete has been known so many medals after all.
Tichon lost his WM title from 2005 nine years later, after being found at testosterone doping.
Meanwhile, the 40-year-old had to give up Olympia silver in 2004 for steroid dopings and the EM title in 2006 for testosterone abuse.
The bronze medal of the 2008 Olympics was also awarded by the International Court of Sports (CAS) on the basis of a judgment.
At 80.04 m he is in rank two of the world's rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km go, China): The world recorder and gold favorite was tested positively only in May, but can still start in Rio.
At the 29-year-old World Champion, references were found to the intake of a prohibited food supplement, which the barrier of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA fell mildly and expired on 13 July.
Bombing terror in Thailand - Austria injured - Several deaths
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.
You have suffered cut wounds and have been treated in the hospital, but you have already been able to leave this.
Your home trip planned for the beginning of September.
Whether the further explosions on the island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens are unclear.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been in constant contact with local authorities, as soon as possible.
In the approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok capital, Hua Hin was first exploded on Thursday night in a quarter of a year.
According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two explosions again went up, another person was killed, according to the authorities.
A bomb explosion was also reported by Phuket in the spring.
In the detonation near the beach Patong popular with vacationers, a taxi driver was injured after police reports.
In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing a city employee.
According to the authorities, the bomb rate had gone into the air in a flower area before the Coastal Police.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast called for several injured.
You're going from a connection to the explosions in Hua Hin, it's called.
"The bombings carry the same handwriting," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning in front of journalists.
"We assume that this is a coordinated attack."
It is too early to speak of possible motives - probably, however, it is the actions of Muslim rebels.
The Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of Muslim separatists in the south of the country during the attacks.
On the other hand, the Thai police stated that the assassinations were not related to the Islamic uprising or to international terrorism.
"It's only local Sabbath days that are limited to limited areas and provinces," said a speaker in Bangkok.
Rather, it appears that the bombs have been dropped by enemies of the ruling military union.
In the past days, authorities had received confidential information on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however, they had not been informed about the exact time and places.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attack.
The police advised their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand, there are increasingly smaller bombs, but they are not usually against tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace used over years by the king of Thailand Bhumibol Aduliadej.
Following the current bombings, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage that the instructions of the Thai security authorities be followed.
High safety risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songghla as well as to Preah Vihear and the environment.
Following disagreements between security forces and Muslim populations, no necessary travel will be made in these provinces.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the Military Junta.
This will also give the military great influence in the coming years.
Junta Chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs had been an attempt to establish chaos, while the country was moving towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The military commanders, who had taken power after a period of bloody unrest in 2014, are of their own benefit to have the Kingdom restored to stability and order.
However, it has not been possible for the military to get the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country into the grip for years.
More than 6500 people were killed in the conflict.
Almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok during an attack on a popular Hindu screen - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the most bloody attack of the country's recent history.
The right "Identitative Movement" is placed in the viscera of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
After several country offices, the Federal Constitutional Guards have also put the group under observation.
"We see at the 'Identitary Movement' points of reference for efforts against the liberal democratic fundamental order," constitutional head Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin said.
In this way, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are being defamated in an extremist way.
That's why we're watching the movement now.
The "Identitative Movement" is a group of French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012.
It is aimed at "multikulti-wahn", "uncontrolled mass migration" and the "lost identity of its own by overcoming".
Constitutionalists in nine federal states - Bremen, Bayern, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - have already observed the "identitators".
Maässen said that his authority had agreed closely with the country offices in the decision.
"Groups like the 'identitary movement' are trying to pick up their target group where it stands," said the head of the Constitution.
In general, extremists try to address them with youthful language, often with poppy music.
That is what Islamists do as well as right-wing extremists do.
This is not a tax advertising for your own business.
The propaganda is supposed to address people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
Recently, there were reports from several federal states about contacts of "identifiers" with AfD politicians.
Maässen said he didn't have any clues.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point of view.
It is clear whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - by certain persons who are extremists is changing their target direction and becoming so extremist.
It is therefore crucial whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
In view of the clear increase in law-enforced crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, he said he would not yet speak of new right terrorism in this context.
But we have found in the past years that there can be legal terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler Group.
It can be quite true that other right-wing terrorist groups or minority groups are planning attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a far-reaching or European control of legal terrorism is not noticeable.
The groups have been formed on the regional level or on social networks.
He was concerned that many abuses were committed on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That's the problem.
Many of the suspects were previously not known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene.
"So many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who may have been politically indifferent or, for example, chose CDU, SPD or left, which have then radicalized themselves by right-wing extremists."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte will be the Internet hit
The Olympics or world records do not always determine the beat lines in the Olympics.
This shows the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Hatte during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight Ethiopian swimmer floated so slowly that he was not seen in the TV pictures anymore.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
In the social networks, Habte then became a viral internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old ends up with a 48-second delay and placed the 59th place of 59 starters.
But it was rather not just his sporting figure that drew the attention of the international media.
Why does the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian was granted a special right of departure from the International Swimming Association.
This is distributed to make swimming more popular in under-represented countries.
Since most athletes run in Ethiopia, they just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.
Soon the first peaks made the round.
Some media called him "Robel der Wal".
The English Boulevard sheet "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made fun of him.
His time, he only hit with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters freestyle, did not matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
During the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, the running of Eric Moussambani provided media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea when he had to enter in an advance over 100 meters of freestyle alone.
Frenetically, Moussambani was then set on fire.
The 22-year-old then learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

An open industrial air in DTLA receives a cozy makeover
We celebrate the 90th birthday of the Central Library of L.A. with - what else? - a new book
The owner of a shop in the New Square has been rented.
According to the police, the 67-year-old lawyer had left her business on Monday at 5.30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor.
When they returned the next morning at 8.15 a.m., about 250 euros had disappeared from the cash register.
No traces of the perpetrator could be found.
There is also no video surveillance available.
Trump doesn't see the threat of election.
The Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump, speaks at an election event in Florida.
If it wasn't for the U.S. president's election, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He'll just be on vacation.
If Donald Trump lost the US presidential election in November, it would be relatively no match for him: "It will either hit it, or I have a very, very nice, very long holiday," said the Republican candidate in a telephone interview with the US TV broadcaster CNBC.
If it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness, then be fine, Trump said.
He thus referred to US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, as the founder of the terrorist militia of the Islamic State (IS).
Within his party, there has been more resistance.
Post increases in trade with electric transporters
An electric auxiliary vehicle of the German Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the danger is obviously great.
The post plans to sell your electric vehicle StreetScooter as well.
In a short time, the group wants to start trading with the carrier.
The post will also offer its electric transporters from next year on the free car market.
"We want to enter the sale to third parties," said one postal speaker on Friday.
The company has been checking for months whether to sell its own developed StreetScooter, with the letters and packages, to other companies as well.
The Post Office of Jürgen Gerdes had said that there are always requests, such as by artisans.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonner Group will soon enter the mass production of the vehicles.
In the post-manufacture, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer.
Gerdes had announced the Group's intention to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and launch a long-term complete conversion to environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're changing the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on the streets of Germany since 2014.
GfK management decreases after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK is replacing its chief Matthias Hartmann.
The retreats came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK revealed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann became more insecure, the longer the success he had promised.
Turbulence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After the new disappointing business figures and the downturn of the company management, the world number Five of the industry is ahead of a personal start.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company by the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, is already leaving the Supervisory Board on 12 September.
As of 1 September, the management board took over the management board, the former board member Gerhard Hausruckinger, informed the company.
He will officially take over the function of a "presiding speaker" until a successor has been found for Hartmann.
As a basis for the withdrawal, the company called "different views" on the long-term business policy orientation.
Details didn't want to call a business speaker on Friday.
The future leader of the market research company is still unclear.
In investment circles it was said on Friday that the shareholders had recently been disappointed by the continuing success of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the GfK-spitze since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring are not yet visible after 5 years," it said.
In view of the recent bad GfK business figures, any shareholder will be at some time uneasy.
"If that were the case with BMW, then the Quandts would do the same," it said.
The company had not been able to stop its loss in the previous quarters even in the second quarter of 2016.
With EUR 361.2 million, turnover was 6.1 per cent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
With regard to the first half of the year, sales decreased by 721.2 million euros by 3.4 per cent.
The profit in the second quarter was mainly a burden on the company's impaired value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The company subscriptions of EUR 139 million that became necessary in the Consumer Experience area provided the group with a loss of EUR 148.2 million.
In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK still earned a group profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus rushes in krummhorns in graves: Eight injured
On Thursday, eight people were injured in Krummhörn (Aurrich County) in an accident involving 43 seniors.
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, the police reported.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to avoid, according to their information, an unfavourable cargo which had been driven partly on the rail.
The bus came right from the street and rushed into a grave, as reported by a police spokesman Aurich/Wittmund.
"Because of the situation of the bus, the people could not leave the bus on their own," she said.
The firearm frees the insasses.
Six rescue cars and a notarz van came to the crash site on Landesstraße 2.
The unharmed passengers were taken back to the Krummhorner district of Pewsum by a bus.
There they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
The investigators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic metre of water shall apply from 1 October 2016 for the area of the river basin Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 euros (so far 2.26) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (so far 2.18 euros).
At the site in Azendorf, the discharge fee will be increased again no later than when appropriate improvement measures are needed.
After a super-calculation, the drain price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, during the approval of the budget, the Landratsamt Kulmbach found that there were undercovers for these sewage facilities.
On the basis of legal bases, the market in Casenddorf is obliged to operate the facilities cost-effectively.
As of 1 October 2016, citizens and industrial and commercial companies from Welschenkal, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to get deeper into the money bag.
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the Board, a recalculation of fees was necessary for the sewage facilities of the market community.
In the period October 2016 to September 2020, over-covers from the previous calculation period were also to be offset.
The gravity of the charges was based on the fact that, in all three sewage plants, it is relatively small facilities with a very low rainfall, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.
In this way, due to the low distribution basis, for example, expenditure on necessary repairs of several thousand euros would be serious.
In addition, in all three plants, the water rise is slightly lower.
Furthermore, in the remaining calculation period of all three installations, due to their age of repair and repair expenditure, they have not been significantly affected.
The facility in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for Welschenkhal, Neudorf and Reuth, as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.
Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the Azendorf sewage treatment plant due to damage.
In the pump plant Welschenkahl, the nearly 20-year-old support plants had to be overcrowded and Lopp had to be back-up after almost 20 years of operation of the first sewage treatment plant, the sewage sludge was removed and an additional ventilation facility was installed to meet the water law requirements in the future.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenditures came to the attention of the required maintenance and maintenance costs to be taken into account during the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs which were still clearly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Stone houses made it clear that in the case of a small spillage attack in the three plants, the costs for the operation and maintenance were "full".
In addition, Schmidt, the market community of large maintenance costs for sewage plants has been spared over the past 20 years.
The situation for these plants will continue to be precarious in the view of stone houses for a long time, especially since it is not possible to extend the water supply area of the Friesenbachtal Association to these plants because these are defective facilities.
Bulgaria booked for the first time in 8 months inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first over zero since last October, as positive 0.2% were booked.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) was measured according to the CPI -0.8% compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101,0 %, i.e. monthly inflation was 1,0 %.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016 a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed compared to the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and shoes (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education unchanged.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticised as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million users to change reality and play with identities in a way that already limits to absurdity.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be made from a Roy Liechtenstein painting.
The filters are unspoilt, characteristic rotating tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All missteps have reached the public.
Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past, in which they were accused of promoting the Blackface app as a better or white skin as a beauty ideal.
When this week some users proposed a filter that gave them scratches, false teeth and twisted waves, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians - "Yellow Face".
They wondered whether these repeated controversy pointed to a larger problem that the company had diversity.
The news and excitement were widely spread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it would have disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: the filter was meant as a tribute to anime characters and not as a cartoon by Asians.
But those outside who have experienced racism remembered the filter of hurting clichés.
Others rejected the anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely distributed over the photos, wrote that the filter was "damaging and flattering."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the opposite of a very hostile Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellow face has been drawn to the depreciating extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural barbed wire.
American culture seems to be wrapped up in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people - who are different in race matters than their older opponents - could rather expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat's filters creates a picture that is politicizing for a user, "it's so much more difficult to keep such things unnoticed than it was earlier," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and media engineer, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.
In a set for media and in a telephone interview she said that she believed that racial controversy reflected a lack of diversity in the settings of Snapchat.
Zhu criticised the white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Neither do they have different representations of people with other skin colors in their company, so that they can make such decisions," said Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or well-being to say anything against it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely left Snapchat unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees, but according to one speaker, the company recently appointed a staff manager who focused on underrepresented groups of people and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu said that she would leave her snapshot account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say it's not OK."
Military management falsified ISIS Secret Service Information, Committee of Congress established
Military members of the United State Central Command changed news service information to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic state in Iraq and Syria when the actual situation on the ground had been permitted, a committee of inquiry of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Military Committee, the Secret Service Committee and the Defence Budget Committee, reports with great dissatisfaction among Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported how their estimates of US efforts in the fight against the Islamic State were changed.
The Central Command, in short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Reporting service information that was typically denied by high-ranking Centcom commanders regularly drew a positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed the actual situation on the site and were consistently more positive than analysis of other news services," a newspaper article quoted the report.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The conduction errors in the Centcom reach the top of the organisation.
The ten-sided report shows in detail persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts to train Iraqi forces.
Although there is no direct indication that government summits have given instructions under Obama to change the reports, it shows how analysts have been exposed to pressure from their precepts to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before the Congress were much more positive than the facts," the report noted.
For example, a Centcom relative publicly announced that a military takeover of Mossul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigations, it is so clear," said Mike Pompeo, a Republican congressman from Kansas, in an opinion.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the heads of the Central Command changed the news service reports to lower the risk of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans called the Task Force into their lives after they were told that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports about the Islamic state.
The report published on Thursday will continue to be completed by more detailed findings during the investigations.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are under way by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence.
Democratic members of the News Service Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an extremely limited process for the creation of news service estimates for ISIL and Iraqi security services," the high-ranking democrat in the committee, a member of the Adam B. Ship's House, announced in an opinion.
This process, according to Mr. Ship, "delayed the publication of news service reports", damaged morals among analysts and "gived too little room for differing opinions."
But Mr. Ship and the Democrats indicated that they had not found any evidence of the White House's intervention with the Centcom analysts on a "defined political opinion".
The preliminary results of the congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
Last August, the New York Times reported on investigations by the inspector general of the Pentagon, which were recorded following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press spokesman for the Pentagon, stated in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the congress reports, while the Inspector General's investigations were still underway.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."
The investigations have had an impact on the question of a successful air campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).
However, last year's accusations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
Criticism about the secret information about the Islamic state reminds of events more than ten years ago when a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush, opposed the recommendations of many analysts, provided for only a small crew in Iraq and little time to reflect on the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current report on the Islamic state.
Last year, the team on Mr. Hooker stated that, contrary to the Government's statements of air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State, there was no significant impact on the group's financial situation as these provisional refineries had been put into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin went to rest in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
USA wins fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with Britain ahead
One day, after shooting three holes during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two doors for the American women's field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.
Five towers in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said they couldn't remember ever having done it.
"I have no idea." she said.
I don't belong to the people who keep their doors in memory.
However, she knows that the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympics and are in their group with the British in the first place, which is unbeatable after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter final, the game will decide which of the two teams within their group from six teams will achieve the first and second place.
The first one will leave the strong Dutch people a little longer on the way that leads the other group.
Whatever the game may come out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising turnaround through their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games in the last 12 places.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time in three years she had a hockey match in her hands (their two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at the age of 16, she became a national player in the United States, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the Olympics in 2008, as she could not qualify for the course.
Then came the year 2012, in which she and her team had all screwed up.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the National Team, began to make things better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the job pen in London that we have now.
We've got the rudder full-blown.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the gates in the first half of the game with a back-up from the area.
India had gone to the game without victory in the tournament, but the team suddenly turned to the dice and held the play level from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and ran the ball into the gate to provide the Americans with a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutdown was the first of the whole tournament for the American Tortoise, Jackie Briggs, who had to book a door so far in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will it depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
In the midst of the rally of the Olympics, the centre of the trampoline
Wherever you are, as late as it is, it is the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel stable and unmistakable, a fast-paced gap between competition and pursuit.
It's like the Olympic fork itself would be a burning staff, which will be moved to the triathlete by the armrest shield to the swimmer.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the waiting line at the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympics for the first time and is a woman's nightmare with grooves, could have been under these well-known names that are sent to the Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being TV advertising if he were a swimmer, tournament or even a fighter.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline tournament.
The Olympic Flame does not light up every event at the same time.
Next to the center, partly in the shade are sports that are not generally recognized: air gunshots, bowshots, Badminton, Taekwondo.
We'll always have the chest swimming and we can rule it for a long time.
But if I should modestly make arguments for my particular favorite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of trampoline.
Although the trampoline jump has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been so noticeable for the last 16 years that many I had asked did not know it was a kind of Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline race and has had an athlete who has managed it until the end of 2012.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for men and the Chinese and Canadians for women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jump has a certain external charm, partly because it is more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clown school than it sounds for the Olympics.
In this place, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an Earth-bound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoon-like sitter of its never to end with the rush - but also the grace of the turn and dive, the two kinds of sports that unite it in essence.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means as much as "the springboard."
Strugglers jump on a giant trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet into the air and have a series of falling movements (turns, traps and jumps) before they land on the feet.
They will be evaluated according to the official Olympia programme after execution, difficulty level and flight time.
Two-thirty athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will join in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is directly.
Medal hopers must continue in their pursuit of gold, faster, upward and upward, sometimes to the goal, sometimes back and forth, upward and downward on the playground.
They pursue not only the finish line or the starting wall, but also another high-end goal in television broadcasting: the world or the Olympic Accord.
The goalful pursuit is noble, wonderful, even fanatical - and it is enough to move even a viewer to tears.
But it's also what I feel a bit tiring to watch these games myself.
The trampoline offers an atempause.
The vector of the trampoline spring is at the top.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she goes off, seems as grave as an astronaut, goes up, then goes down, then tirelessly back up.
Here too a competition prevails, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as the competition in the Olympics can only be.
Women's qualifications and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; which the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on two days from 14.00.
In the middle of the Olympic Mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general.
If the raising of consciousness can only be achieved by the attack and objectification of male athletes - as the American male tournaments recently proposed, according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley is expecting his new fan community.
"A generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators calling for political changes in Ethiopia face violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say that during the clash with the police during gunfights, protestors were killed.
Is Ethiopia just about to break up?
In the last ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government have shaken the country and have expanded in more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people flocked to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government's response was unmerciful.
Witnesses reported that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Watching videos about the protests that are probably from the beginning of this year show how security people beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a handle against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
In Nigeria, Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western assistance.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new pendler train in the capital of Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was all but an example of democracy - human rights organizations have consistently brought oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, and dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven to the depths of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and have no other options but to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
The whole youth protests.
A generation protested.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the land use to the attack on the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now controls 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions rose along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this vicious, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, who have been more or less tense in recent years, could exploit and rearm the turbulence.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding under the surface after years.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and improved Internet services.
Even if the government is blocking access to Facebook and Twitter, what it is doing at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate about Internet proxyes that hide where they are staying.
Several young Ethiopians claimed that they had gathered for protests.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since Eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia mainly from Christian highlands, flourished in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many are Muslims and live in flatland areas.
But that's just what's going on.
"We are coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigers, who make up about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military, in the secret services, in trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was, until his death, the prime minister of Ethiopia, a non-public illness in 2012 for 17 years.
He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think of horns.
Analysts say that he was particularly versed in seeing early signs of dissatisfaction and using special agents to edit opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailmariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively opaque reasons to adopt Mr Meles' position.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigris region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the tiger.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such an uprising was in 2005, after thousands protested against the elections, which, according to analysts, seemed to have been deceived and stolen by the government.
During the following sentences, many protestors were killed, even though it was less than in recent months and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised the leaders of Ethiopia for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new Pendler train, as well as for their measurable progress in combating poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal disadvantage of the Ethiopian government.
And it adopts a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month Protestants attacked businesses run by tigers in Gondar, an amharic city, and hatred against tigers is becoming more and more common in social media.
Analysts say the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a unique position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as the basis for drone flights across neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it had closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his allies to collapse into an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin walk."
Donald Trump explains his claim that Obama founded ISIS was "sarkasmus"
Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to break down the last controversy surrounding his campaign by stating that his repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, would not have been seriously meant by the "founders" of the terrorist group of the Islamic State.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the presidential candidate of the Republicans as to whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehensiblely with the American public.
It also brings his opponents, who are trying to protect him during an eventful phase, into the proper position to explain statements that he could not have meant.
After he had made the announcement at a election event Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump ran back on Thursday's claim and was in interviews arguing that he really did not intend to have the President and Mrs. Clinton created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he thought the charge was quite serious.
When the conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it.
The last storm of criticism is pushing Mr. Trump down, while he has tried to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to falling survey values.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton spoke about the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump again tried to return to this topic.
He reported on Twitter and warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already presented Sarkasmus to his defense.
At the end of July, he drew strong criticism when he thought the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he said, "Of course I thought it sarcastic."
This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic boundaries into politics and then to rush back as necessary.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, to "clear up" according to how the reaction goes." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also believe that he is smart enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of aggravating the tone for the presidential elections, Mr Trump has adopted an even more intense tone as his survey values have gone down further.
A new survey of NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a leading leading in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misconception of his humor.
But while he is focused on his last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's joke has brought his loyal opponent into the uncomfortable situation of having to stand with him, no matter how challenging his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, worked hard today to defend the candidates in a CNN interview from Thursday.
"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic state.
In this sense, it is true that in front of Obama ISIS there was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backlinkers, completely wrong and that was why he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most Mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to expand by allowing it to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.
Before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and urged them to ride around on each of his words and to take action against him.
He rebuked the "poor, eternal" television experts who tried to understand him and said, "They can't!".
Some of the Democrats ridiculed Mr Trump's apology as just another proof that he was inappropriate for the presidency.
Once overpriced from the market, Café returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a scenic café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay bar, which had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, it was forced by the prices from its Bedford Avenue Charging Front.
The shop Soap Cherie, which replaced the verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of Cupcakes.
Locals regretted it as the last loss in a gentiling city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is a change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is off and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is a change, then it's a new invention.
A popular Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
The coffee's still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old café, the owner and manager of the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him money for a new outpost, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of money.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bags bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with spice and cheese and there are garnishes such as capes and saturated dunes.
There are natural travel locks.
The café no longer serves beer, there are fresh juices for it.
After nine months Rodriguez said that he had noticed a steady flow of old tribal customers.
"Many old customers were also forced by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg earlier and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she was taken to Greenpoint, she would take the path.
After the verb had been closed, she gave up the coffee drink for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was in the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even though on this day instead of her usual Iced Coffee, she ordered a blended Chai Tea, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal is another long-term and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and always ordered the same.
"I came quarter after seven, every day like a Swiss bag watch and they prepared my Everything Bag with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still receives his usual order, but sometimes he changes his everything bag with spice, eggs and cheese.
Rodriguez said he didn't have a grip on the fact that the soap shop took over the old business.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to make a special coffee for verb with the cold-frozen coffee of the café as a ingredient.
"I think we're still going to take her offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish Greenpoints also accepted the café.
A new customer translated the food card into Polish and Rodriguez said he planned to expose it soon so that his new neighbors would feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice shop wants to fill the cold-frozen coffee into bottles and sell.
There is a chance that the café expands to a nearby building.
For many customers a new verb is sufficient to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was tribal and said that he was destroyed on the floor when the café closed.
When the new café opened, White said that entering the premises and ordering felt a new coffee like a homecoming.
"I had to smoke that," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his rise as President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
President Roosevelt had a weak for refined delicate dishes on the Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu on this day was somewhat modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato purée and as dessert a plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," Jane Ziegelman said.
Your husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes' last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in the United States, while Ziegelman told her book "97 Orchard" about life in a housing house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Your newest collaboration, "A decent meal", which will appear on Tuesday in Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, bonded imbis in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, Truthan ate with potato purée and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered Hackbraten, this found the couple suitable for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression.
"Rich foods were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There were strawberries, liver cheese and beans.
They were prepared from a ingredient and something cheap that extends the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe grinste.
"It must have been in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was an all-you-can-eat buffet in an American household, especially in rural areas.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked pasta for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" records the ways in which the country went about to be no longer the Schlaraffen country.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for Americans," Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Similarly, the new budget diet was strained: Secret foods such as bread and casseroles became basic foods, which could be used as "a wonderful way to recycle food," Ziegelman noted, as kitchens could hide raw ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which has been the center of the American cuisine for years, has become a rare luxury.
Unique mixtures were tested because a calorie rich and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even a healthy kitchen mind.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a court from this age, baked doubts with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition at lunchtime," Coe says.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Groundnut butter and baked dummies do not match.
It was typical of many of the household recipes.
As never before or since, economic operators - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - have made a similar move to the country's eating habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budgetary politicians" and to meet the challenge of turning Pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of historical taste buds.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-mich-Kuchen-Essen-Haltung, are delicious.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his kitchen, he ate like the millions of heavy men of the world to which he became.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with gurken sauce," Coe said.
He ate in an almost golden dining room and wore a tuxedo.
He was wonderfully strange.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the owner of a housekeeper with no interest in taste directions by Mrs. Roosevelt led to the creation of the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most comforted prepared."
Many of the species from the era of Great Depression, to deal with food, were rejected as soon as the land returned to its legs.
The authority is based on our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as on how science has been applied to food.
The couple agreed to better understand the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example, how she could not throw away food.
"She was really afraid of the waste of food," Coe said.
Ziegelman remembered, "She actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the dishes were covered at Eisenberg's, they and Coe produced a dessert that they had prepared at home: the river dessert, President Roosevelt ate at noon.
"It's called Prune Whip," Ziegelman said and added that it was a common trick to pass a modest recipe a good name.
There was no beaten soap, only flowers, some flour, sugar, water and cement.
Each dived a little reluctantly into the fingers, brown glibers.
Amazingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe got a tail three times.
Like a can-do-budgeter, he said to his wife, "A couple of hacked walnuts would help."
Killed by a bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life at risk to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to people in Syria.
He risked everything to save others' lives.
Now the 30-year-old himself died of a phase bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group that has saved nearly 60,000 people's lives so far, according to the time of the picture.
2900 volunteers are putting their own lives at risk to get people out of bombed houses and to give first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the Civil Protection Officer showing him at an 11-hour rescue of a baby out of a house shed went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrians a shining symbol in the grey of the war.
However, as a hero he never saw himself, according to the image, he said: "For me, this is the true jihad."
"When I die saving my life, I think God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar himself fell into an attack on the victim, he had talked in a video about the latest bombings in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four phase bombs over the Alzadia district, one filled with chlorgas.
A woman and two children die, seven people suffer from breathlessness.
"We are now eliminating the toxic remnants of the bomb so that children do not play with it," the image quoted his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime was supposed to meet terrorists.
Greenland hai: The oldest vertebrae is almost 400 years old
Rare view.
Greenland haie usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed back into the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims well 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - until today.
Greenland haie is only 150 years of age.
Appropriately, the Greenland hai swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of just 1.220 meters.
Only when it arrives, the five-metre-long animal speeds at 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast as a robot with this maximum speed.
But this slow lifestyle seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" anyway from a Greenland hai who could be 392 years old.
"Wahnsinn," comments Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, which means a world record for vertebrates.
Even though evolution biologists have long suspected that Greenland hails.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are hard to observe, and they live mainly in the icebergs in front of the thin inhabited coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland haie.
They measured their time pace when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.
Even so, these sharks do: In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a robot, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young ice bear.
Maybe they're hunting sleeping animals or patrolling because of the icebreaker and looking for Kadavers who wander down from higher levels of water.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues were now investigating 28 Greenland haie, who were taking fishermen from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitzbergen.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lens of the shark with the carbon-14 method.
This center of the lens is already created before the birth of the shark, the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had an impressive amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempts increased the amount of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
On the other hand, in the 3rd smallest animal with 220 centimeters of length, the lens kernels have a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear tests, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.
All the larger Greenland sharks, however, had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lens core, which is caused by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 hour showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimeters long Greenland hai, while the record shark with 502 centimeters would be even 392 years old.
The fact that Greenland hai females were only raised when they were more than four meters long was known.
Now the researchers of the length could assign an age.
As one of the animals with 392 centimeters may have stood on the threshold of gender maturity and was determined at 156 years of age, Greenland haie is apparently able to grow for at least one and a half centuries.
This should also be a world record for vertebrates at present.
The fact that such candies live mainly in icy waters is not an accident.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, whose tail had a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was also caught in front of Alaska.
Because of the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often goes to save.
So they grow later - and older slower.
In order to stay warm in the cold water, the animals are often especially large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, by which the animal heats.
The heat loss of a grams of mouse is therefore much greater than that of a grams of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible," explains evolution biologist Scheuerlein.
On the other hand, a very large animal should invest its resources in a long life.
Building background in double pack
With topics on construction, the municipality has taken a serious interest in the latest meeting.
The Board took note of the announcement by Mayor Robert Putz that "at last the marketing of the most recently identified residential areas can begin".
After the questions of land, parcelling and unlocking were clarified and the applications could be met, the sale of the land in the residential areas of "straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße area - extension section 1) is no longer in the way of interested parties.
The municipality is convinced that the grounds in the rural and quiet residential area of Schönau young families and quiet elderly alike address.
As it was called, construction volunteers can report immediately to the Council, the municipality will be expected to advise at its September meeting on the distribution of the parcels.
In order to be able to comply with requests for the establishment of other occupational establishments, the municipality decided to amend the area use plan in sub-areas which had been established only in the spring of this year.
Thus, in the area of undertimers, the business area already identified there is extended around two parcels towards Staatsstraße 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city of Am Main thus has the best chance of attracting jobs and companies that have moved from London to Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from Brexit's vote," says Michael Voigtländer, Head of the Field of Competence Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the IW.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether financial houses can continue to operate from London to finance all over the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, they have so far been granted authorisation in the UK.
That's what big U.S. banks are using.
Several banks have already announced to move jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" has 10,000 new jobs at the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, so the IMF, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisor EIOPA and the ESRB Risk Board, is united.
Although the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The closeness to the notary bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with supervision," says IW Professor Voigtländer.
Although Luxembourg has a large fund sector, it is also less likely that Dublin will cut down on infrastructure.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
In addition, the city has easily available commercial properties.
"It's not that easy in Paris to find free high-quality offices," says Voigtländer.
In addition, the rents for first class commercial property are 50 percent higher than in the Main.
Furthermore, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime.
In a ranking of Mercer's company advice, the city was in 7th place, Luxembourg in 19th place, Dublin in 33rd place and Paris in 37. place.
Even if quality of life is a question of preference: "With its already strong position as a financial base for the European Single Market, Frankfurt could attract other banks and investors," the IMF notes.
Despite the Brexit vote, however, London will remain the most important financial center in Europe, according to economic researchers.
For this purpose, the strength ratio is also discussed: in London, according to the figures of the Helaba Landesbank at the end of 2015, there were around 144,000 people in the banking sector, in Frankfurt there were 62500.
Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
One U.S. official decided that Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to reimbursement of the legal costs arising from the Hepatitis C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from a compensation payment of $200 million for the violation of two Merck patents related to the blockbuster medicines Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a US judge discovered a pattern of misbehaviour by Merck, including mineide and other unethical actions.
At the hearing on Thursday, U.S. Attorney-General Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to bear the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck is trying to draw up Gilead, which controls the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck each other complained and took ownership of laboratory work based on sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in the Gilead medicines.
US-backed troops say they have regained full control of Manbi from the Islamic state
US-backed troops have regained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border, after the last IS fighters in the city left, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The democratic forces of Syria (DKS) are fighting after the extraction of the remaining group of fighters who have dug inside the city, currently the city.
You have freed over 2,000 civilians who were held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish shared with the Manby Military Council of Reuters associated with the DKS.
"The city is now under full control, but we are running clean-up operations," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published her tax statement for 2015 on Friday, which was awarded to the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, Clintons donated USD 1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton earned almost USD 5.3 million in redehonors; the former Foreign Minister gave a income of USD 3 million from the Simon & Schuster publisher for her book about her time in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's candidate for the Vice-President, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, published together with his wife Anne Holton his tax statements over the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards on financial transparency," Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri announced in an opinion.
In a great contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false arguments and withdrawals regarding his previous promises to publish his tax statements.
It is customary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements, although they are not required by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"You're on the train," Clinton's voter Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, referring to the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's Special Adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax checks were completed.
Trump's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of 2012 Mid-Romeney, have already made it possible to raise questions about assets, donations to charitable organisations, businesses and various other connections, in particular with Russia.
Clinton has already collapsed on the subject and released a video on the Internet on Friday, in which the high-ranking Republican Trump calls on him to publish his tax statement.
On Thursday, she also spoke on the subject during a speech to the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publishes his tax statements."
Politico reported that Trump did not pay taxes for two years or very little during the 1990s, and a New York Times business journalist quoted on Friday a number of tax lawyers and tax advisors who indicated that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election struggle.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire and investor Warren Buffet that would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During an election event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska called for Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Industrial Conglomerate has its seat here to exchange Trump to a meeting to exchange their tax statements.
Buffett said he was also subject to an IRS tax check and Trump had "anxious" before the voters and not the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has issued a tax statement since 2007.
The Clintons now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid on average an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The 2015 Clinton tax statement showed that these are only USD 100 of their income as wages, unlike most of all Americans.
Its main fund was a cost-effective index fund, from which the Clinton dividends and income of USD 109,000 taxed.

Condoms with chili powder, firework bodies promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Naturalists in Tanzania use an unorthodox method to prevent elephants from going into inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on those filled with chili powder.
The method has proved effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea of doing so years ago, has intensified its support together with the U.S. nature protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-stage method to protect their houses and crops without harming animals.
Many muscles have previously used to defend themselves.
Friday is an elephant day dedicated to animal protection.
"Since we developed the ... toolkit, we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities, while they are much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants," Honeyguide Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a fork and blowing into a horn.
If he's not scared, a so-called chili cloud will be thrown away.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a firework body into a condom, whose end is turned to the ignition cord.
When it is lit, the condom puts with a hook and sprays fine dust on chili powder into the air.
A blow is usually already out to hunt the elephants.
One last possibility is a fireman who shoots a gold-fired plant into the air and thereby causes a loud, bright explosion.
City Council unanimously decides: No church building at St. Goarer Rheinufer
The St. Goarer's investment projects are usually undertaken by business operators with Kusshand - but the retail trade in the core city is considered to be clearly comprehensive.
However, the city council is now unanimous in rejecting the request for the new construction of a skisk on the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine-Palatinate building.
"We basically welcome new business operators, but at this location in an exposed position on the Rhine, this kiosk does not fit," Michael Hubrath told the CDU Group.
Jewish director destroys Berlin Hotel because Israeli preference has been removed after "arabic" invitation - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unveiled a media riot after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli preference, since it had "requested" Arab guests according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentation "Shoah", released his sorrows at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country selection list.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and destroyed?
wrote Lanzmann.
Instead, the Kempinks Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel through its own Call Center.
Following a statement, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there was "shocked him", as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure was a "intended decision of the management of the Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind this was even more angry in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the selection be deleted," the employee of Lanzmann was quoted.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame", reports the South German newspaper.
We were distraught and saddened by this event.
That's really very embarrassing.
The fact that this has been done in Germany precisely in this hotel chain is even more shameful.
That doesn't need a statement.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident triggered a pretty big resonance on the Internet, where people called the whole scandal.
Some suggested to the Kempinski Hotel that it would have "surrendered" the supposed demands of Arab guests.
"Woe to you," said another contribution, pointing out that the hotel, which is located at the noble parish, is close to a synagogue.
The hotel quickly showed all the charges and called the incident a "suit" and "excuse yourself" at Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was never a direct order," Israel did not enter the Quicklist," the South German newspaper quoted a speaker from the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country preference has now been added.
Police use tear gas & rubber guns against protesting Brazilian students
Students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered to protest against government reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to drive the students apart, leading to the police using rubber and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their frustration over the plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, some 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be put in place to save money.
Some of the Protestant participants saw graffitits spray on walls against former President Michel Temer.
The most recent protests took place a few days after protestors in masses went to the streets to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate at their election.
Trade between Russia and Iran rose to 71% suddenly - RT Business
With the lifting of the sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagarianan, the trade between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent per annum.
Since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, the Russian company's interest in business in the country has grown strongly, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are taking up existing links with Iran, while new companies are willing to gain access to the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzagaryan said.
He noted that trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran increased by 91.5% and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade suspension was achieved by the supply of machinery, agricultural vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
This year, Dzagaryan comes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia.
Last year, Russian foreign representatives issued around 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Furthermore, Iran reached the top 20 of the countries with regard to the number of tourists in Russia.
It could be said that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia have been broken since last year," he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition," he said.
Witnesses sought: overrun the drinking market in forest bröl
A robbery was carried out on the drink market of Rewe XXL on Thursday evening at the forest brüler Gerberstraße.
Subject to a gun, three dark-dressed persons who had worn their faces demanded the release of cash from the alcoholic market and then fled first on foot and then probably with a silver-coloured VW golf.
How much money has been spent, the police don't tell.
The perpetrators should have been between 1,60 and 1,70 meters wide, that is, relatively small.
The drink market is immediately accessible and badly visible from the parking deck of the Rewe market.
After the attack in the direction of Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Egelbert-Weg and the shooting parking lot opposite the parking lot must have escaped with the silver-coloured car, possibly in the direction of B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who has actually made observations at 7.45 p.m. in connection with the robbery should report urgently to the police.
Nagold: game and fun at summer break
Eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social pedagogical day group/social group work of the Child Protection Band Nagold with their caregivers on their summer vacation in Nussdorf, near Mühllaker.
In the quiet leisure house Hardwäldle, the lively group was surrounded during the first school vacation week.
Several full-day trips were on the program.
For one thing, it went to Bretten with the visit of the Streichelzoo.
On the other side to Maulbronn, where there was a special child guidance in the world famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
At the Keltenmuseum in Hochdorf the group experienced much about the daily and the food of the Kelten.
During the hot days the group enjoyed the deep lake in Maulbronn, which is invited to jump, swim and plank.
Culinary children and caregivers with their own prepared body foods, such as the sour spatzle, the sea-brown pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English breakfast and Tübinger Bolognase, were decorated.
In workshops it was batiked, made beautiful pieces of pearls and stones or made from wood a Roman mill game.
Other highlights of leisure were fishing in a nearby pond, the evening at the fire and the final "Bunde Evening".
On the day of the home trip the sun and the children and young people laughed joyfully back home.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims for the gate of mercy
The ministers from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna's soul care unit were on their way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Four steps have been taken together.
In order to bridge the time to the next Rome wave of all ministers in probably two years, the High Minister round St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage goals were examined and finally decided for the Bishop of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage was offered with the gate of Mercy opened to this end at Freiburg Münster.
16 Minis of Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch, and Holliest were on their way.
Earlier in the evening, Pope Storost sent the Pilgrims out in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrims and awarded the Pilgrims.
From Horb, he was taken by train to the starting point of Villingen, where there is also a monastery of Our Lady's love and thus the Pilgerweg was introduced by the monastery.
The individual daily tours were framed every morning and evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and scriptures.
But also on the way, the Minis made field crosses, chapels or churches always rass to sing together a song made up of their own Pilger Liedheft.
For the nights each parishes of the local parishes were available.
Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day it went on about Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
Days later, the stage to St. Peter, which was the most challenging route, had to be reduced to about 500 meters above ground heat, and then it would collapse again.
The deserved reward was a common barbecue at the bathroom at night.
After the morning impulse on the fourth Pilger day in St. Peter's imposing monastery church, it went to the final stage of Freiburg.
Apparently relieved and happy the Minis met later in the afternoon at the Freiburger Münster and passed through the gates of mercy.
With a small impulse, God was thanked here.
In the evening fair in Münster, the Minis arrived at the Pilgrim's goal were welcomed by Cooperative Markus Obert.
After the service of God, the Pilgrims were able to visit the shrine and the high priest.
The next day there was still time for the Breisgaum metropolis.
In the afternoon it went back by train to Horb.
In conclusion, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked.
Schotte Callum Skinner storms home when British Gold hits for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner ran last night in the Men's Sprint in Velodrom in Rio for fame, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took on the anchor role that his countryman, Sir Chris Hoy, had become his own. The boy tip made the legend proud when he stormed home to home a victory from New Zealand's favorites.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after getting only a modest sixth place at the London World Railway Championships in March despite Hoys' retreat.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Stafff.
They did this in time when Hindus showed up.
Hoys Rest created a hole that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man with whom she stayed when she saw potential in the shot that has now unfolded.
Hindus, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinners placed an Olympic record in the Qualifications Rounds, but in the Standard Rounds the New Zealands won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hinds was barely back after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.
A change in strategy made up a large part of the transformation, where Hindus went in a higher pace to slow him down and enable Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace.
Today, as BBC experts, Skinners, Kenny and Hindus appeared from his position when they went up to the floor.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for me.
In the end, we set up an Olympic record and beat the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph on the Kennys and Hoys side, Hindus admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the train.
He withdrew this statement later and there was no objection from England's rivals.
In such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindus said, "It feels like with all the GB flags on the tribe like London."
We've been together as a team in the last three months.
We've gone so bad with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that was won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect a successful five days in the Velodrome.
In the form of Kenny, it is possible that he repeats Hoys' victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would be for Kenny - who is just 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23rd (an apparently holy date for British sport; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger bannister were also born) - meant a profit of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That's coming from Hoy.
Kenny participates as next in the sprint, which starts today and will go for three days.
The 28-year-old Bolton said, "I only enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels something lonely to win alone.
Hindus said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Doll qualified with the fastest performance in the four-mile race.
They arrived at 3:51,942.
The world record that won in 2012 in London Gold was at 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) takes place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will be safely focused.
He had fought with officers before the qualification yesterday when he was called by officials to measure his body size.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milgavie advanced in world record time at 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong railway team to dominate the mid-term of the Olympics and get a lot of medals.
After a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were lowered.
Dramas took place in the background, so the retreat of the technical leader Shane Sutton in the middle of sexism and mobbing projects, as well as the rest of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton in April.
However, when you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks as if the now legendary call GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated.
The future of Portland merger due to the abolition of the energy contract
The future of the aluminium fusion of Portland in Victoria - as well as the hundreds of jobs of workers - is at stake, as the plant operator cancels the energy supply contract and is thereby cancelling all supply contracts, as announced by the supplying energy company.
This step followed the decision of the Government in Victoria at the beginning of this year not to grant further subsidies for the operation of the plant.
A grant for 20 years will expire in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.
In addition, domino effects could occur as the melting industry consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity production of Victorias.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry Meltingerie, which last year led to a closure of the English-sea power plant.
Alcoa smelting in Portland loses money and risks closure.
This step follows the years-long speculations about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that it is based on the fact that three other owners will cancel their contracts.
The facility is located in the majority of a joint venture owned by Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller parts.
"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity through the melting industry," the company said.
AGL further stated that the contracts were so-called "securitisation shops" that should have entered into force as of November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period so that they will end in 2017.
"From this point, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the financial year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential impacts on AGL's revenues from GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong time markets for wholesale electricity.
AGL reported that it had already written down the value of the contracts in its annual conclusion amounting to $187 million in "expected cancellation".
Alcoa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts did not affect "the ability to operate Alcoas... the melting industry or to ensure the supply of electricity to the melting industry".
The US company said that it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 that should have entered into force as of November this year, even if it still owes a statement of why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts warn because of the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland Meltingerie in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
In light of the analyst's statements at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts and around 900 megawatts of electricity annually.
If both plants were to disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [power market].
And it wouldn't be good for us as a power producer," he said.
More than just a Kardashian Reality TV Star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner Clan Kris is on the cover of the desired September issue of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and visiting fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, the view of this cover brought me to the wine," Kendall wrote.
The discovery of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians similar?), a scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family (with the exception of the problems Rob and Caitlyn and in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they forgot the cover of their sister and ended with a classic twist: they all planned a surprise party.
This represents the cliché-contained action almost every birthday episode of a child broadcast (Seacrest brought the sentence, "Do you think we'd forgotten you?" with the honesty of a cartoonist on a radio at 8:00 a.m.), but Kris had to let her other girls share in this publicity somehow.
In view of the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's big sister Kim likes to beat up the Vogue Cover (they and her husband Kanye West were watching it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for themselves.
The September edition is for Vogue the most sold edition of the year.
With an extent that is more like a picture band than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (according to fashionistas there were 832 pages of the roll 615 pages of advertising).
The discovery of its cover star is so ambitious that in the last two years, images of the magazine have been secured before the official announcement.
Women already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been clearly more "familiarities, models" than "familiar models" on the cover.
Oscar Prize winner and Dior Ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even with the little chance that Mrs Jenner - described by the magazine as the "transgress model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.
These fames are not related to famous people or to reality stars or young people today who know how to turn a good snapshot video (even if everything happens to them).
They are really talented women who are outstanding in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner's success is not for everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner’s position in the fashion world has always been somewhat tense.
In June, the only Victoria's Secret Model criticised Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called her "the evils of the moment."
These feelings boiled up again when the message came out with Jenner's appearance on the Vogue Cover.
But riding around on the mist seems to pass at the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.
It is in the truest sense of the word a supermodel.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
It makes advertising for your foundation of Estee Lauder.
You and all your sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her leisure, she is watching in reality TV. Probably just to see her sister Kurtney and her children.
Community law centres show 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 of the country's aid needs are rejected by the Community law centres each year, while the sector focuses on the effects of further cuts on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly older people, immigrants, needy workers, victims of violence, and those who do not have funds for unjust declarations and similar ones - are already denied free legal advice and legal assistance when applying.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already overloaded, are ready for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal centres are expected to lose another 30 percent of their federal assets.
The Director of Municipal Law Centres of Queesland James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Law Centres revealed that thousands of people are already being rejected every year.
Farrell said that the situation would only get worse if the Federal Government did not repeal its decision.
"Queensland's community law centres are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people of important services you need are rejected," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with inexcusable and oppressive debts, families that go through separations, workers who have been unjustly released - all these people have legal problems and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will reduce the funds by 30 percent, which means that thousands of more needy people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Federal Attorney General and the Federal Minister for Justice and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to remove these cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need in legal problems.
Last year, the Government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of community law centres and their client communities and to see that the government of Palaszczuk is investing in this important work.
Donald Trump Election campaign filed after employee allegedly pulled gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was accused of alleged inactivity after she was informed that her campaign leader for North Carolina had been pointing a gun to an employee in February while they were in a jeep.
The case is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday at Charlotte's National Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini said to have waited months for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that "it would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "drawed a gun, placed his right index finger on the take-off, and framed the run in Vincent's knee," Bordini said in his indictment.
After complaining about the local and regional campaign management, Bordini noted that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
"Weapons do not have to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said.
The prosecution comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered a riot when he told a number of people in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment People" - gun owners and arms friends - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and appointed judge.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had broken its words out of context and that it would not engage in violence.
Bordini's complaint requires compensation from the campaign for the violation of care and from Philip for bodily injury and permanent mental damage.
Trump's press spokesman Hope Hicks was not able to reach an opinion.
Trying to contact Philip was also a failure.
WCCB, a local broadcaster in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign.
He did not respond to calls from his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Survey before country elections: lose SPD and CDU
In the upcoming elections in the Federal Countries Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), significant losses for the government parties SPD and CDU are recorded.
These were representative surveys of the INSA Opinion Research Institute for the "Picture" Time (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could hardly continue to rule, this is not possible according to survey values in Berlin.
In both countries, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have good opportunities to continue to lead the government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD dropped from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
Thus, according to the survey, the party is only close to the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.
The left is 19 percent (before 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented with 19 percent for the first time in the country day.
Despite slight losses of 6 percent (before 8.7%), the greens returned to the Heavy Land Day.
NPD and FDP would not be represented by 3 per cent in the country day.
According to the Berlin House of Representatives, the SPD of the survey is only 23 per cent (election 2011: 28.3 per cent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
They are still behind the greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent) but above the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented for the first time in the House of Representatives by 14 percent.
With 5 per cent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates would rather miss the entry than 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The First Smartphone
E-mail and Internet in Zeitlupe: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came to the market.
The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it wasn't well in hand.
On the contrary, it was pretty clever.
The built-in memory was at the beginning of eight megabytes, which today would be about two selfies with high resolution.
An iPhone is currently delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" just 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, came into the business - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices online, but they are somehow from the stone age of the Internet age.
20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit Computer Fair in Hanover as a "office in Western pocket format".
In fact, the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot of text and e-mails for then standards, even by fax the communicator was able to reach.
Even access to websites was possible through HTML browser, even though it was very slow.
A laptop was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be tapped like a laptop.
Then they found a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
Quite proud of the price: 2700 D-mark, i.e. around 1400 euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
No one knew in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything has been different.
The smart phones are a success story, even if not for Nokia.
The phone-part of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold and processed to Microsoft.
Today, the market is dominated by suppliers who came all much later than Nokia.
Always and everywhere to be online, that is today for many people every day.
In 2015 there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices have been sold, including only 555 million pieces on Samsung and Apple.
The global turnover of the equipment is around €400 billion.
In addition, the well-running shops of the countless app providers and the telecommunications group come together.
Around the smartphone has now created a whole industry.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market began in 2007, when Apple Chief Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone on the Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicator, all easy to use via touch screen.
Apple's victory started, and today the iPhone is the most important product of the group.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who ruled the market, had the look.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
The saying now has Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung.
The smartphone is an understanding of itself 20 years after its invention.
On average today every German looks at his phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to put the smartphone away once too," said Janina Kugel, in Siemens's staff management.
Permanent availability is now considered as curse and blessings at the same time.
England needs to steer the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring not only renewal and prosperity in our local municipalities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the biggest attraction Heathrows, just as in 2012 in London, when we made a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will already create 10,000 new teaching centres, 40,000 new jobs and create an end to youth unemployment in the airport area.
As they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be some who will think that the challenge of Heathrow's enlargement is too big.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blame ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong 2012 and they will also lie at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question he asks.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for each infrastructure project.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs to create £211 billion in economic growth and to leave both the airport and all GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion high-cost infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - which was selected for five years as the world's best airport terminal, to the T2 which was built in the middle of the world's two most frequent runs.
Now they are ready to deliver a third step, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time that we steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow and ensure our future trade and create an authority of skills and employment that can be proud of England.
Lord Paul Deighton is president of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasure
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "Cat and Mouse game" regarding advertising block
For companies that earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to deal with advertising blockage are equal to a "cat and mouse game".
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertisements on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network again.
On Tuesday Facebook told that his desktop page would change the coding of his advertisements to make it difficult to detect what part of the advertising page is.
But Adblock announced that it had found a new way to deal with the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock Ben Williams' spokesperson wrote that "this kind of hi-and-her-fight between the striking Open Source community and the surrounding area is already in progress since the invention of ad-blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has been involved in the fight is a strong indicator of how worrying advertising blockers have become for the industry.
According to a last year study by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people are using advertising blockers worldwide, almost four times in 2013.
With 1.03 billion active users every day accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84% of Facebook's advertising revenues.
The company has looked at Ad Blockers on Desktop PCs, as mobile Ad Blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a speaker shared.
Advertising on Desktop PCs makes up a large proportion of the revenue, so Facebook appears to invest such a step as a reward.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "advertising preferences tool" to increase people's control over advertising aimed at them.
On Thursday Facebook claimed that Adblocks would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising.
"It is not a positive experience for the users, so we plan to address the problem," a Facebook spokesperson shared in an e-mail message.
Advertising blockers are a stupid means, so instead we have focused on developers tools such as Ad Preferences to put more control into people's hands.
Transfer woman in case of alleged suicide on Swiss highway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses after a woman was transferred on a highway in the early hours of the morning on Thursday at a suspected suicide of several vehicles.
The event took place on the A1 near Morges in Canton Waadt shortly after midnight.
A woman lay in the dark "in an act of despair" on the street and were hit by several cars, the police said in Waadt.
It is obvious that a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was overcrowded by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been detected, but some have still not been identified, the police, who have called on these and every witness of the incident to report.
An investigation procedure was opened which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be expected that one of the drivers will be shown.
Was a collision inevitable?
That's something the prosecutor has to decide," Courtster said.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held responsible.
In each of the two cases - in which a person walked in the dark on the highway - it was decided that the drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian walks in the middle of the night on the highway, as was the newspaper.
Last year a police officer was acquitted of the fatal murder after she had beaten and killed a man who was on the A1 one night in August 2014 near Payner.
The 22-year-old victim had been drunk and had become unconscious on the street, the court admitted.
The Court found that the police officer -- who had responded to an emergency -- was driving in a justified way and that a man's presence on the street was "a completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has any further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once habitable.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2 dense atmosphere could have once present similar conditions.
Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earthlike atmosphere and yet slowly moved forward.
The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.
The planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and protect it from rapid deforestation.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent more.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its day-page of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as a rain screen to shield the surface from a large part of the sun's heat.
The result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than those on earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although at one time it was likely habitable, Venus -- over the course of billions of years -- was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans were flooded and their water vapour was burned off by ultraviolet light.
When your hydrogen developed, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained behind -- the Venus that we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy retires as a coach of Avalanche
Patrick Roy retired on Thursday as coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche and led to too little co-determination in the team's decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will seek a new coach without delay.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as Chief Coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in an opinion.
In the course of the summer, I spent a lot of time thinking about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, which it needs and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a right of co-determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who was elected by Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of this decision today," Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
During his debut season at the Avalanches 2013-14, Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the League.
He led the association at 112 points and in the first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was hit in the first round of the playoffs of Minnesota and missed the season after each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 brand in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the wild for a second Wildcard spot at the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, strike off
The work struggles with regard to the remuneration of North Sea workers are being postponed, while all parties are putting themselves on the table for a new round of discussions, the negotiators said.
Strikes against the oil service provider Wood Group were sporadically carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the United and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to resume the process of resolving the current conflict," it says in a joint statement.
We will hold some whole-day meetings in the coming weeks, which will begin next year to address the problems again.
The trade unions said that their last strike, the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has this year reduced its rates to its North Sea contractors by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in the company's interest is followed by a 10% decrease for Onshore clients in 2014.
The company said that additional reductions would give the company the space needed to get through the market depression.
Shell has released thousands of people for his part and announced plans to give up his oil and gas business in up to 10 countries, as it rationalises his business as a result of its mega-connection with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, an economic situation which had been strengthened by the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
The Scottish Member, Dave Anderson, met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that have taken place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for many and not for just a few," he said in a statement.
2016 is expected to cost less than $1.4 billion for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of about $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the constellation of the Pleiades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the Pleiades.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars rotate at different rates in the constellations and how the rotation times are related to the planet's origin.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age, and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebul, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The star cluster of the Pleiades is 445 light years from the earth.
Many stars in this cluster, which were created about 125 million years ago, now reach the adult age.
They're turning the fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these mature stars emit large amounts of star winds.
Since this wind travels through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars turning slow pyrouettes as smaller.
"In the "ballet" of the cheerleaders we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
Since the constellation of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare star qualities such as rotation rates.
"The star cluster of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebul said.
There is still much more to learn about how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and so to speak, hang their "dance shoes".
Rebull and their colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports in detail their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A Controversy Baseball Star
The tears flowed faster at Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in the best days of base.
After his emotional withdrawal announcement, the 41-year-old pro will be wearing his New York Yankees' Tampa Bay Rays' Tampa's shirt for the last time on August 12.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," said the 14-time All-Star Game participant of Major League Baseball (MLB).
Three times Rodriguez was selected as the most valuable player in the league, in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract gave him 27 million dollars a year since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 it will function as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary.
As a player it paid Rodriguez back long time with performance.
With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994-2000), Texas Rangers (2001-2004), and since 2005 Yankees created some milestones.
With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players show similar values in the main statistics.
However, the 41-year-old should not be included in the hall of the baseball club.
Because as successful as Rodriguez - the peak name "A-Rod" - was on the field, so arguing is his appearance outside the square.
Already in 2009, the Superstar agreed to take steroids prohibited from 2001 to 2003 with "ESPN".
In August 2013, due to a development in the so-called biogenesis scandal, it was blocked for 211 parties by the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered as the main suspect to have received powerful funding through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida for years.
After a legal dispute, the barrier was further reduced to 162 meetings.
"The League might even have liked me for 2014 because I spent 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said at the time.
His days of separation also do not run out of silence.
While many baseball legends in their last games again received the big stage, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bank.
"My job doesn't include a farewell tour."
"My job involves trying to win every game," ate Yankee Coach Joe Girardi.
Meanwhile, Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz and the relationship with Popstar Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson, was told by fans' sympathies by the Yankee Erzrivalen Boston Red Sox.
"We for A-Rod," the supporters sang at 4:9 against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silvia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Accrued: Due to a positive doping sample, weightlift Adrian Zielinski from Poland must not start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are overestimated by the first official doping cases.
A learned athlete would have won almost a medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping cases were the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre obstacle runner Silvia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weightier Adrian Zielinski have been tested and excluded in Brazil - just before the start of the so-called critical athletic competition, these messages come to an end in time.
In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances, was already shown last Sunday.
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday the 18-year-old had placed the fourth place in the final over 100 m butterling, only 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen would have participated in the prefabrications over 50 m.
Chen requested the opening of the B-test and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation from Chen in the investigations", Xinhua quoted from a statement: "We will work with the International Court of Sport CAS and accept the judgment".
For the first time in history, IOC is no longer responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also on Rio's night, the news of the positive test at Danekova went through, and the 33-year-old went into the offensive itself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," she said to the Bulgarian TV broadcaster BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," said the lightweight athlete.
According to the report, the prohibited substance should be EPO.
Danekowa was temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-sample should have already been positive.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissow immediately responded to criticism of the Athletics.
"I don't understand why athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "we Bulgarians are under surveillance, so many are already excluded."
Thus, about all weightlifters from the chronic doping-loaded nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic winner of the class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tomasz three days earlier positively on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.
Both contest the intake, but both must not start in class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the light sports, the case of Danekova is particularly a major blow to the reputation of the whole sport.
The World Association IAAF had banned the start of the entire Russian team until an exception due to systematic doping, also the Kenyan running nation produces many bad news in Rio.
In the swimming sport, the former crimes in China had also caused serious disputes among athletes.
So the French Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic Sun Yang.
"The sun that brushed purple."
"When I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to surrender," Lacourt said in French radio.
Sun was also at the centre of a dispute with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I don't have time and respect for doping fraud," he said.
Sun was tested in 2014 at the Chinese championships positive on the Stimulans trimetazidine, but only a three-month barrier had to be removed.
Data Key: Hacker So Perfectly Repressed
Programmers of oppression malware are currently targeting targeted companies and are successful.
According to a current survey of Malware defence specialists, among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed in the past 12 months were at least once, partly several victims of an attack with epressor software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies were already targeted for ransomware.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom money required by the offenders in order to be able to reuse the systems and data they had attacked.
The perpetrators specialize in their pressurers software according to the observations of malware by looking at attacks in corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the potentially oppressive solution is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently observing an amazing fast evolution of malicious software," explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski in the discussion with the "world".
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the perpetrators discovered oppression software for themselves.
At first, private users were the target, but the change to corporate attacks took place rapidly in the past few months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once on the computer of a victim, it aims to search for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or Database files, as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the originals permanently.
The software then presents the demands of the oppressors.
In order to get the final encryption code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of the crypto currency Bitcoin.
However, where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is stopped.
Consequently, the damage is higher when a ransomware hits.
22% of the German companies concerned reported loss of sales by ransomware, 13% even had to interrupt their business completely, in one case people were in danger of life.
In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients may be severely threatened by the loss of medical records.
"We always say to the victim: don't pay, you're only promoting the problem," explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay get their data back.
For Managers it is difficult to refuse to demand the perpetrators in the face of a standstill in the operation.
The hackers know that again and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a current study, security researchers from F-Secure have examined the user interfaces and the contact with the oppressors and have found the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to make more money.
They explain their victims by chat, how they can pay by bitcoin, freely access support websites to or decrypt example files instead.
And after paying a few hundred euros, private people will have to negotiate in part and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potential high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware extortion, hackers become more and more professional and share the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider Sophos explains: "A single person can write a ransomware about within a week."
However, it is more likely that these are three or four persons.
The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software building box to the actual oppressors.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between $1,000 and $10,000.
"The scope of delivery includes an adaptation tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The oppressors then seek further hackers to distribute the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So one logs into one of the forums in the background, buys the set from a criminal and orders another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"Criminals usually order spammers with distribution," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data.
Over 50 percent of company IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey rely on ransomware to resist using file-backups and scanner software.
Consequently, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful recovery, the perpetrators are threatened instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski.
Thus, according to the type of data, the potential of damage is still much higher than before.
In the future, too, the perpetrators could set new goals on the Internet.
At the Defcon Hacker Conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the release of such a blocked heating could be worth a ransom.
If, instead of heating in the future, the perpetrators block an entire manufacturing road in a factory, Ransomware could also become a topic in industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little cuppe and also the versatility of a minivan.
It sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new Jazz, actually turns out to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although only 1.60 m high HR-V seems relatively small, the passengers have plenty of space in the first row as well as in the fund, it does not work very closely.
The materials of the interior are well-processed and work pleasantly, only the cockpit top falls down there.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage room.
Not only is there a 453 l case room available for elevated and 1026 l for folded backrests, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the seat area of the back bank can be raised like a cinematose and thus offer a storage room, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The trunk can be loaded well, but the load height is a little higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1,6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 PS accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide turn ranges.
However, he was allowed to do something quieter.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is happy.
There is another motorization: a 1.5-l benzene with 96 kW/130 PS.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the direction should be something more direct.
The equipment does not reveal any wishes in the tested top-version "Executive".
Security systems include the City Emergency Brake Assistant (working up to Tempo 32), the collision warning system and the tracking assistant.
The collision warning sometimes irritates because it rated many obstacles when grading as "accommodating objects".
Very reliable the remote light assistant is working.
And the intelligent tempo rule responds to traffic sign recognition and speeds up if necessary.
However, the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI books are under the armrest and are therefore to be reached in a circumstance.
The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the gasoline from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines comply with the Euro-6 standard.
With the HR-V Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline not in charge: crash on flight bridge
An airline is not responsible for the crash of a passenger on the airport bridge.
Because a liability can only be assumed in the case of hazards typical of air transport, the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf argued (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken a knee disc at the crash.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it is a general risk of life, the court says.
The airline did not have to pay the man any damages.
Sickness: When the organizer pays
The sick leavers only get money back after their journey if the cause of the illness is undoubtedly found in the hotel.
But this is only when more than ten percent of the guests show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, on the second day of her Turkish leave, a family was seriously ill with diarrhoea and vomiting.
She spent most of her vacation in the room.
Their illness led the vacationers to a faulty clearing system that allegedly polluted the sea.
The family was of the view that the trip was not so bad - and complained against the organizer.
The plaintiffs had no success before the court.
Although the clearance was actually defective.
However, the organizer only experienced this shortly before the plaintiff left.
He had to figure out by then that the seawater was okay.
So he didn't violate his information obligations, so the verdict.
There were no contaminations found in water samples.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly by burning each other - is part of the general risk of living.
Of the 691 guests, only 38 were sick.
De Maizière said that, according to the violence perpetrated by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were worried about further attacks.
The state had to be calm and determined to respond to terrorist threats at the same time.
It is certain that our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We won't be able to do this triumph to the terrorists.
If criminals had to leave the country more quickly, however, this would increase security and strengthen the people's consent to refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to achieve implementation of the proposals by the 2017 federal election.
He also announced a further personal strengthening of the security forces, namely "in the medium-term quadrilateral order over several years".
The campaign for terrorism had to be punished again.
Video surveillance is intended to improve, so that arms law is so renewed that, above all, the purchase of weapons on the Internet is more difficult.
The last much discussed obligation for doctors to remain silent according to the Maizière's words.
However, in the dialogue with the doctor, he wanted to look for solutions to reduce the risk of citizens, he said, for example, in the face of mental disorders.
In order to combat the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers that better social care is necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared to deal with traumatized people.
To prosecute criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet) de Maizière plans to use hidden investigators.
SPD Chief Gabriel said: "The SPD is willing to talk about everything that helps to increase security".
It is important that the Minister of the Interior has made himself clear against actionism.
"It was an earpiece for the sharpmakers in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel told the newspaper of the Funke Media Group (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union after a Burca ban and the abolition of dual nationality.
He considered a general ban on complete disclosure to be constitutionally problematic.
You can't forbid anything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burka.
You can talk about rules, for example in road transport or for witnesses before the court.
Green Chief Simone Peter put it before the minister, he wants to simulate with ever-new anti-terrorism packages the activities and the ability to act.
Left Party Chief Bernd Riexinger said: "Flow language and a strengthening of the right of residence do not bring security to people in this country anymore".
Better traffic flow on the motorway
It is based regularly on the road around - here is a picture of November.
But this should change: the legal basis should be extended.
This is good news for all drivers who are on the road to work every evening in the barn when they drive over the highway (A 43).
On the coming Tuesday and Wednesday (August 16th-17th), the country farm road construction extends the legal trail of 700 metres between Hammer Street and Weseler Street.
Drivers can then directly unwind from the Hammer Street on the right.
The great advantage: transport is split earlier, thus improving the whole course on the many-proportioned section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU group representing Münster-West in the district.
The train assembly on the Zübringer is particularly exciting for the drivers between 17 and 7 p.m.
Working days reach back to the bridge over the Albersloher road and sometimes beyond.
The needle ear is on the B 51 shortly before the departure of Weseler Street.
From here, traffic is directed only through the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt about a quarter of a year ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer had the necessary carrier power to take up the heavy-duty traffic in particular.
As long as this tight pass and the associated day-to-day stock will last, the competent country holding cannot say.
However, it is estimated that the bridge has an official use period up to 2034.
For the extension of the legal loophole, the country's farm has deliberately chosen the weaker time in the school holidays because it has been affected.
Transport is carried out on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site.
Intercultural Travel: Cultural Offers for Schools
The international class of the forest school visited the theatre "The Invisible House".
The association Nima's and the young theatre are now planning a music project.
Nima's association allows young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Klasse International" of the Forest School Kinderhaus has visited a performance of the award-winning piece "The Invisible House" of the Young Theatre Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Travel" initiated by Nima's association, 19 students between 11 and 15 visited the scene in the small house.
Since the beginning of the year, the Association, which has set itself the goal of cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds, offers schools with welcome classes to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most of the young people in the class were from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 and speak little German.
Thanks to choreographies, screen pictures and video animations, it was possible for them to still follow the course of action, according to the press release of the Young Theatre Münster.
The association Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the young theatre will be working together in the coming game time as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without refugee and migration backgrounds between 14 and 20 years of age will be given the opportunity to attend professionally inspired courses in the fields of singing, dancing, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre and theatre language communication are in the planning.
The project "Intercultural Travel" continues.
In view of the rising numbers of refugees, the association is counting on many classes who want to participate.
Rain Instead of Starbucks: Hope for a Better Weather
The weather has made the Starbucks Guckers in southwestern Germany a line through the bill on Friday night - but there is still hope.
The night was bad because of clouds and rains to watch the sky show, said Star Warte Welzheim, president of Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope lies on the night of Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we're sure to see a lot of stars in the sky.
The stars are perseides, which are 216,000 kilometres per hour of the fastest star cuttings.
They have their name because they appear to come from the constellation Persian, which rises in the northeast.
Restless Night: Tips against Sleep Disorders
The night you wander around forever, you lie awake for hours, morning is no longer long before the wake-up bell to think about sleep.
That's all but refreshing.
At the same time, you are in good company with such problems: According to Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders express themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and there may be various reasons for them, says Hans-Günter Weeß, a member of the Management Board of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What is understood over time, however, is insomnia, that is, an insomnia and sleep disorder.
Just sleeping makes many people feel unsatisfied or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, a board member of the German Hospital Liaison Committee with practice in the Lower Saxony Warel.
What's behind sleep disturbances?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
After this, organic, mental or behavioral factors can be applied, but also medications.
Sleep disorder is not uncommonly an expression of another disease.
"Very early awakening is especially common in depression," says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors are interrelated.
For example, if you have a bad record, watch every two to three hours and perhaps start to grip on everyday problems and concerns, give an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
Since when should you sleep with sleep disorders to your doctor?
Anyone who is not well asleep for at least three nights a week for a period of one month and is affected by the day should go to the doctor, advises Weiss.
The impact may look quite different: you are beaten, tired, sleepless, have difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily manageable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headache.
To alleviate sleep disorder, it is important to find out why.
Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medications - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and for a maximum of two weeks.
There is hardly any established sleep medicine in Germany, says Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medicine center of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, you should first contact your home doctor in case of sleep problems, advises Weeß.
He can determine with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the bedroom, and what's going on there?
For example, in the sleep laboratory, physicians advise for example, in snoring with breathing disorders, in the case of fatigue of the day, in sleepwalkers, or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder, Kietze explains.
You don't really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normal.
"Just don't sleep for lunch," says Pietze.
After the cable, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear a nose glasses, a chest belt and a feeler on your finger.
In addition, a camera on the roof records the sleepers.
How can those affected get into the grip?
There are quite a lot of screws where you can use for a better sleep.
We know: Regular times of sleep and awakening, not too long in bed, not sleeping during the day, not watching TV for sleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start to calculate immediately, and that is not quite encouraging.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler spoke on Facebook about the disappointing cut-off of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he won gold for the short-track world championships in Doha for the first time and at the same time recorded his first world record.
Now the former DSV-Athlet Markus Deibler has stood by Facebook protecting his former teammates in the face of criticism.
"In a country where an Olympic winner gets 20,000€ and a jungle king should no one wonder about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night.
The promotion system in swimming sport is bad, however, the doping controls are very good.
This means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look so closely at the subject of doping or even operate it.
"I'm not saying that the controls should be set here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Debelr had to be notified nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
That's exactly how you should keep it with countries.
"Those who cannot be controlled at any time before WM/OS by independent controllers of WADA/FINA must not take part," asks the voter, who is currently holding an iceberg.
Airport: Band of luggage thieves arrested
Professional hire at the airport Düsseldorf
Civilians of the Düsseldorf Police managed to arrest two women and two men between the ages of 50 and 61 on Thursday.
The suspects had run several pocket and luggage thefts as a band.
By 9:30 a.m., civil officials in the Düsseldorf Airport recognized a band that was known to policemen from past thefts.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July and have been engaged in community-wide, labour-intensive and, in particular, professional activities.
Specialists at the Criminal Commission 34 can prove four acts to thieves who were specifically involved in criminal offences in Germany.
In total, they had spent over 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few linden trees, meanwhile another headstone patch: The Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work at first sight, but the police are among the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you go from east to west, you come to playgrounds, a freshly carved kindergarten and a biostorey.
On the facade of a grey house, someone sprayed "horrible!"
In contrast to a Lidl, which is to be removed soon, is already being built: by 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here.
Articles about this "trendous part of the city" as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain is called, however, in recent weeks, they are preferred to be represented by burning cars.
The reason is the house with the number 94: Once occupied, the residents have rented contracts, but on the ground floor still have rooms and are used for events.
In particular, Berlin's Insensator Henkel had repeatedly spoken against the project since the beginning of the year, the area as "no-go-zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
On June 22, after the rooms on the ground floor had been cleared with 300 police officers, the police patrolled for three weeks according to official statements by 30 to 40 officers and three on-site crew cars, blocked parts of the street and prevented visitors from entering the house with the number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers refurbished the premises on behalf of the unknown house owners.
On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the room was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers withdrew under the jubilee of sympathizers and residents.
This summer afternoon, the street seems peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the street in front of the houses in the sun, others sit in front of the sun.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and children's gardens.
Left violence is not the main concern of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neubauer, who has been living in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who raised three children here, are particularly generous with police presence.
With the inhabitants of the house projects they share the care of rising rents and generification.
It doesn't sound like a Kiez who wanted most police protection from vandalizing links.
The tomb opened by the Berlin Interior Senator and the police between homeowners and their neighbors does not seem to exist.
Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional work district, which has a low average income and high poverty risk today compared to the rest of the city.
Households and their home projects have been part of Kiez for a long time: in 1990 many houses were occupied in the former DDR, including almost the whole Mainzer road near Riga.
While the mainzers were cleared under a large police offer in a regular street fight, many of the projects in Riga have been legalized and are now partly inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years the district has become increasingly the magnet for tourists and voters from all over the world: with them, residents from DDR times and former homeowners share their kiez.
This is also noticeable in the rentals, which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: they are recognized on inserted discs or freshly cut facades, which have been cast with colour labels.
No other road was mentioned this year so often together with the words "linksautonomous violence".
One reason why not all neighbors might view this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as bodily injury are said to be almost exclusively against policemen.
Most of the crimes constitute damage to the case, which tends to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neubauer, who has been living in a rented house for 17 years next to the controversial 94, there can be no question of uncertainty.
As far as violence is concerned, it is regrettable that the 94 people are their neighbours, who have certainly not been.
Even the most famous burning cars no longer exist directly in Riga.
For the studied architect, their road is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere".
The new building is consciously dragged into the Riga Street - and remained.
That is why it was so important for the inhabitants to get back to their streets: from the police, politics and the media, who all of a sudden in July claimed the height of interpretation across the area.
But in the eyes of inhabitants like new-builders the road will continue to be taken away from them: through faceless new-buildings in former buildings that oppress the old inhabitants.
"These are, at last, property apartments that are not interesting for many here - rather people who are not so well-informed live here," she says.
"Violence and destruction can't be good."
But what should you do if someone never listens to you?
There is frustration on all sides, including with the police and the inhabitants.
For those who are angry about color bombs, Kerstin Neubauer has little understanding: The house projects and the left scene were part of the Kiez.
He who raises himself should be aware of it - just as he who draws himself into a cannon can complain bad about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in matters of integration and organizer.
She is also a social worker on site.
Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach.
The Social Pedagogine supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
She is seen as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working groups Refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else is involved.
Regine customer from the working circle indicates that the honorary officials are more than grateful that Deuchle is now there, the egg milk sauce, which has a problem above all.
In this way, some - less mockingly than on the number of tasks desired - had been targeted by others than the administration wanted to write down the place.
An administrative force was sought with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just an egg milk sauce.
But administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organization, working with people on the site and also behind the scenes as well as networking.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
She's been holding a 50 percent stake for three years.
"It was the highest time," says Regina Customer, Annika Deuschle supports honor and main actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
Soon new containers will be in the Wasenstraße
A serious problem has been finding apartments for the refugees who have been recognized for some time.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living quarters.
The cost of building, renting or refurbishing these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility shifts from council to municipality and job centre.
Problem: There are free properties, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been difficult for some time.
In fact, the administration does not find private apartments.
It doesn't work until now, you're referring to private apartments, Deuschle says.
Therefore, what is so beautiful is the need to build up the homes of the community.
So soon new containers will be set up in the Wasenstraße.
But only with apartments is it not done.
Perspective is the keyword, Regina customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a fixed stay, there are workshops, training centres, schools, one-Euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or set up.
"More places would be good," says Regina customer.
Many work in the Bauhof or help homemasters, do profitable work - and this is motivated and very orderly, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that the work for the community will have a positive external impact.
It's "no employment therapy."
But activity does not just mean work.
The day needs a solid structure, says Deuschle and customer.
People had to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So here too, administration and officials jump in.
It is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are wanted and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.
They have to tell the refugees that it is just taking place and that they can spend time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
Whoever ever develops the feeling, he can help no one in Urbach, must not work and be useless, he will never integrate.
The clear majority was motivated.
But there are also problems, says customer honestly, "People with nothing to do with." Therefore, the work of Deschle and customer is always to motivate others.
That's all a mammoth job.
A difficult question: Are the two of them afraid of radicalisation, even in a small town like Urbach, after the latest developments?
"No," says Regina customer very clearly, "what some naive may call a "resistance" and does not want to exclude her.
Sensitized, however, are the helpers already.
These events were also the subject of refugees.
They'd be afraid that the assassins would put them completely into custody.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regina Customer.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
Thus, there is a need for local and regional officials to look into activities.
They always have in the background that soon a new blow could come to Urbach for refugees and migrants.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
To answer this question clearly, politics is at stake.
In fact, it is unfair to place them on site.
"In Urbach we haven't reached where we want to," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees would relax the situation.
Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already charged with integrating the people so far reasonably.
These are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they have to be helped, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, as there are no simple answers.
Schordorf: Intruder with helicopter
The police helicopter flew off for about an hour from various areas without success.
Two unknown men entered an apartment in a multifamily house in Lindenweg on Friday morning at 8.50 a.m.
The resident surprised them both and struck the property away.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, perhaps masked, wearing both bluejeans and black capuzen pulleys.
They're heading in the middle of town.
The police used several strip crews as well as a police helicopter.
The afterlife was unsuccessful.
The unknowns may have fallen before the fact near the apartment or in relation to their flight.
Baden-Württemberg: Police determined after Rocker attack on Imbis
After an attack on an Ulmer Imbiss, the police identify six suspects from the Rocker Environment for serious land-related peace violations.
In the case of housing investigations, evidence and rabies were secured, the police informed them on Friday.
About 20 masked men of a rock-like group had, according to police in July, thrown bottles and stones against the display panel of an Imbis.
Then they should have attacked two guests and injured one easily.
Then they run away.
In the Imbiss and adjacent buildings there was damage of 10000 euros.
According to the investigators, there is a dispute in the Ulmer Rocker Environment between a Kurdish and a Turkish walk.
