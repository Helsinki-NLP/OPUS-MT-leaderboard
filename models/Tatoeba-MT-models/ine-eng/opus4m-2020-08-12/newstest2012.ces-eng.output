Parliament did not support the new freeing Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament today has refused to withdraw the proposal within the framework of a new criminal law paragraph on which the leader of the opposition, Julija Tymoshenko, was convicted.
The amendment that would pave the way for the release of the prisoner experiential was rejected by the Members when they read the second proposal to mitigate the penalties for economic crimes.
Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October to conclude a allegedly unfavourable contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not valid, the appeal of the convicted person shall be brought before the court in December.
Tymoshenko marks the verdict on the political verdict of the regime, the suspicion of the Court's interest has also led to proceedings in the West.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code, on the basis of which the judge was convicted, supported the vote of 147 Members.
His approval required 226 votes.
Libyan won
The story of Libya's liberation, or Libya's rebellion, has already been defeated.
Muammar Kadddafí is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him is after the war.
There's still a win to be defined.
As is customary in the country, in the elections victory Islamists, it is either moderation or radical.
The Transitional National Council has applied to ordinary Sharia and we already have a certain idea about it.
Libya will become a crime-free country, because the hand will be cut off for theft.
Women can forget about emancipation, possible wastes of faith waiting for repair and so on.
Instead of the dictator's person, the company consisting of rival tribes will merge the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we can't imagine and that we certainly wouldn't want.
Only our way of life is not the only one, nor is it objectively the best, and it would probably not suit the Libyans just mentioned for the change.
In fact, it is surprising that the Islamic fighters received thanks from unbelieving dogs.
The only excuse is that from their point of view, NATO did not lead any general from America, but Allah, whose size they celebrated at every given event.
So when they're looking for winners in Libya, the west doesn't belong to them.
We took part in the shootings, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of the political alliance as a dictator, without guaranteeing any profit.
After fresh bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we don't engage in military occupations.
By this fall, the problem with the "crossbreeding" is being solved locally.
But will they have no occupation of the oil company for the lips of Libyan black gold?
They may not be enough, and the West will finally be able to boast of the indestructible protection of human rights.
So if that doesn't prevent us from telling you the Sharia law.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe have reached the investor search
Statistical death passed through Europe on Tuesday.
Individual states have published HDP data for 3Q.
The Czech economy has been stagnantly stagnant, Germany and France are growing.
But today, the credit market is trading records.
Investors no longer look only at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries of Europe have published preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
GDP Germany grew by expected 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries adjusted data for the second quarter in which Germany was better off than expected (growth by 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), and France indicated that it showed a slight decrease by 0.1% (original data were talking about stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent annually in the third quarter of this year.
However, between quarter and quarter, the hard domestic product (GDP) stagnated and, according to the ČSU, confirmed the trend of gradually slowing down the growth in economic performance.
The results are worse than analytical estimates.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent annually in the third quarter of this year, but stagnant.
The German economy increased by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter according to preliminary and seasonally recalculated data.
The euro area economy and the European Union grew by 0.2 per cent between July and September against the previous quarter, which is in line with the expectations of analysts.
Greece's economy fell by 5.2 per cent annually.
The yield on her 10-year-old debt is 28.45%.
The outputs of Italian and Spanish debt securities are growing at a critical level.
Problems are beginning to feel like Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium etc.
The results for Czech 10-year-old debt securities are kept below 4%, although the situation in the region is deteriorating.
From Germany, there is a voice that the ECB should be a creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO.
In Montenegro, they won 1.0 and celebrates the 200 million-dollar process
Soccer representation is the most difficult task of the season!
In Montenegro and thanks to the excellent Czech Republic and the beautiful gate Peter Jiráčka won 1:0.
The Czech football even with a great deal of luck in the second half saw a luxury jump from home and will not miss the European championship again.
IHNED.cz was following the process of beating in detail.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a great deal of happiness in the second.
The Czech representation also thanks to the domestic nightmare in the finale, the great Czech and the hero Jiráč won in Montenegro a happy 1:0 and celebrates the process of the European Championship.
The blacksmiths were pressured to the second half due to the precise defence of the Czech population.
The gamers became Damjanovich and Vulcan, who burned two great odds.
Even thanks to the excellent Petru Czech representation, the Czech won't miss Europe's championship next year, and in the foreign football cash, the reward will be about 200 million crowns.
He's been playing a lot of combat football since the first few minutes.
Both teams were hard to get involved in the combination and played mostly around the semi-sort.
The pressure from domestic footballers did not come in the first half, because the Czech defence was precisely turning away from the long pitfalls.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They made a living shield.
Several hundred high schools have created a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
They want to express their support for their country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday afternoon, the students prayed before the facility and then experienced the death of the United States and Israel.
Several hundred students at the Iranian University of Isfahan created a living shield Tuesday around the Isfahan nuclear technology centre, where uranium is processed.
They say they're ready to defend their country's nuclear program with their own lives.
In its recent report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (MAAE) noted that Iran has, according to all, not stopped its efforts for nuclear weapons.
The possible attack on Iranian nuclear devices is being discussed in Israel.
On the afternoon before entering the Isphahan nuclear facility, the students prayed and then tasted the death of America and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at protecting the Iranian nuclear programme as much as possible, the Israeli press besides the Isfahan Centre would also aim at a facility in Natanz in which uranium is enriched.
Eater of the obese child: no breakfast and dinner of the wedding
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have overweight problems, with 9 per cent being overweight and 5 per cent being obese.
Obese children, however, usually come from a family of unhealthy lifestyles, as the current survey showed.
Once again, it shows how important it is for the healthy human development of the environment in which it grows and the patterns that surround it.
For example, on the tables of obese children, there are ceremonies up to half of the time than in families of children with normal weight.
The fried vegetables had no more than 19 per cent of the obese by the day before the research related to the educational action called Obesity.
In fat families too, it is not customary to sport, but most families of today’s schoolchildren - only 15 percent of children responded that their parents will find time for active movement at least once a week.
Research among 900 children
The research was carried out at the end of last year’s school year and was attended by almost 900 children from primary schools throughout the Czech Republic.
It was already the second anniversary of the Obesity Action, not an accident that supports the General Health Insurance and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 students from 4 to 8 classes have been involved in the project.
Proper eating and sufficient movement in the family are, however, one of the determining factors that causes a dramatically rising number of overweight or even obese children.
"Only half of the respondents, for example, said that she had five times a day in the breakfast-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweety regime, which is one of the basic prerequisites of proper nutrition," one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and no dinner
Experts point out that for healthy development there are also related details, including regular family breakfast time.
At the same time, in the Czech Republic, only 23 per cent of the families of schoolchildren are eating at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats alone.
And the worst thing was to find out that in ten households there was no breakfast at all.
Breakfast is at the heart of the right daily meal.
The questionnaire showed that in the families of obese children, they consume unhealthy vegetables much more often.
Almost every - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonade every day (70 per cent).
Although he regularly sports more than 40 percent of the children in question, the result for his parents was less than half - 15 percent.
Set up your dining room.
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to build their own dining room according to their own taste and opinion.
"The fearsome preference of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 from a healthy diet is far from ideal."
Among their favorite foods are a lot of wet, massive and sweet food.
"The alarm is particularly large in the form of sweet lemonades," the final report on the survey states.
For lunch as a main food, the pasta won over the poultry.
However, the children almost didn't want to have a lollipop, and the size of fish and southern vegetables is also low.
A Cause for Health
At the same time, the research has shown that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they receive proper information.
"In the control group of the survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the end of the education lecture Obesita is not an accident, there has been a number of cases of significant movement of preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition," the results of the project are stated.
For example, the market was for sweet lemonades, where more children would begin to give priority to ordinary water.
Also, children have been more often caught in the bird and fish questionnaire as the main food of the day and would limit sweet foods and rabbits.
Stylist must also be a good psychologist, hard professionals
In the opening article on how to teach the stylists, I noticed so little that it was a lot in the opening hours.
I didn't know what would follow.
Lectures by three professionals from the field, dressing troublesome characters and a seminar on how it works.
And it'll be worse.
The closer we get to the final test, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it's really "sucky."
This time, Director Allenka and I discussed how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly balanced character.
And that's what most of them are.
Someone's got a short neck, someone's a boy's character again without a proper curve and someone's overweight.
The stylist must know how to visually change the wide shoulder, extend the neck or add the necessary curves.
We got tips like Jennifer Lopez's wife, which means bigger breasts and sides and a tight belt, a character to highlight and, at the same time, not to dress too challenging.
For example, if the difference between the belt and the sides is such that the skirts or the pants do not really sit, then it will pay to have at least one such piece of peace.
You certainly won't regret it because the perfectly falling clothes are to be paid.
In your dress at peace you will feel much better than in one that constantly moves, counts, stays in the passport and so on.
A boy's character can again be allowed to wear clothes with grading, applications, lifts or packing.
This kind of information and character is, of course, a lot, so I'm glad to have a whole week to put all the information in my head.
And I'm afraid, given the homework we've been assigned, it's up to us.
Each of the coursers was given an assigned celebrity, which is intended to invent two outfits: daily and evening.
We need to take into account the current appearance, fashion style of the particular personality and type of character.
I'm gonna "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from Victoria's Secret campaign.
In my mind, it is certainly better for me personally than that Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has recently collected about a hundred pounds (please, in the lead), or young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut the clothes out of magazines or search the Internet and print them and then process them graphically.
Moodboard, as the whole result is called, then also expresses our personal style and relationship to graphic creation.
Thinking about the graphic page of styling is also important.
The stylist does not only dress physically, but also creates so-called product pages in magazines (for example, cable trends, blankets, etc.).
That's what a stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about.
But it's Sunday.
The stylist must have an overall overview
Saturday's lecture was filled with information about the types of characters just three guests from the field.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to use it.
And a fancy stylist can work with one piece of clothes differently.
Variability is key in this case.
So you need to wear such a shirt (or if you want to originally trinchcoat) classically across the jeans and shirt as a coat, but you can also wear it on a bare body, trim the boat and paint it as a dress.
Or just take out the gloves or the straps and immediately the whole look looks different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But most I appreciated the following advice: "You need to know the rules perfectly for work."
"Then you can start breaking them," said Jacob.
Finally, I understand why we are confused with all the teachings that we have to combine with, why, even though we see something else in fashion magazines.
Don't even talk about sightseeing.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know again that the stylist must have prepared a lot more variants of clothes than they go to photograph.
So in the fashion story, which will have ten pages (i.e. ten outfits), I have to be ready to "set up" at least fifteen.
And also that the picture of the clothes looks and works in combination with other pieces of leckda completely different from actually.
So we have to count on it when making outfits.
That the image and style make the lecks up to half the success, confirmed us Honza Pokorny.
It's enough to look at Madonna, which is not exactly a miracle singer, but the image and marketing made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, access to the services of stylists is still colder.
Even well-known faces of her leckda are considered unnecessary (but I just know something, what I look like is secondary).
And if someone already lets us create styling, then we have to calculate that it is very likely that it points to a completely different (less) size than it really does.
Then there's nothing left but Google and find out if the bulldozer didn't write about the popularity of the toast/dubble and so on.
Honza and Mario put it in our hearts on Sunday that the stylists will not be able to orient themselves in fashion and be able to wear outfits.
In his work, he communicates primarily with the people he's wearing, so it's important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to estimate people, not to worry, to stand up to your opinion.
"If you're ordered by a manager to sort out her dresser and fill her with nice pieces, then you can't throw her out the whole box and say, "God, that's scary."
"Find at least a few things that you commend and recommend what you can wear," says Mario.
He also specifically showed us what everything must contain the so-called "trip" or the pocket on the spot.
It's the one you turn around the belt and you have all the necessary properties.
In addition to clear things such as knives, hair-fighting or closing pins, there is also a silicone thread (with it the stylist helps in photographing products such as cables or hats), special clips that we wear back clothing if it is bigger (spin or other pins are not allowed, would spoil clothes) or stitch.
Not only to listen but also to try something practically, we learned how to stick your shoes properly.
Even when photographing the workshop, where the surface is equal, the syringe might be damaged, but outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We can't even touch the shoes so they don't get hurt by chance.
So there's a real need for engagement.
Mario gave me the pleasure of my creation without exception.
This engagement is not really my friend.
This is just a tiny fraction of what we heard about the second weekend course.
I'm starting to get as clear as possible that devoting yourself to styling at the professional level really isn't a walk of the pink orchard, whoever wants what they want.
In Need for Speed: The Run runs across all of America.
Reviews
Originally, the carefree ride is changing into a routine morning trip to Shichta due to a series of totally unnecessary lynching errors.
Ambice's been a great success, but it's nothing valid when nobody obviously wanted to do anything else.
A new section with the title The Run woke up before issuing high expectations.
He promised that the flight race series Need for Speed would again move the pieces in a new direction and from the playable shows appeared as a game that in the genre of the action race should not only be counted.
We were also curious about the impact of the inserted passages, in which the main hero comes out of the car and goes after his own.
As with the NFS series, many are a little different from what we expected.
They're potentially decent arcade races, but they're all pulling down a few remaining mistakes that've been on the show for most of the years.
So it's not really mistakes, but rather some kind of incomprehensible developmental bias.
Adventure starts very well.
You are listed in a story whose main hero Jack has certain personal problems and as a solution is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
You will be seated on the west coast of San Francisco and your task is to reach New York as the first.
There's a couple of interesting elements to think about.
The track is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty races.
As a result, each race goes on a different course and the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don't even have a moment to feel that the game would still offer the same.
Moreover, some of the environments are very nice to look at, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
So it's nothing worldly.
But driving across the desert, the autumn landscape, or high in the snowy mountains, works visually very pleasant.
In addition, competitions have been staged from time to time by some unusual element.
In the desert, for example, you get into a sandstorm, which greatly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you need to be careful not to get sleepy again.
In addition, each race is well placed behind it.
There's only a few of them, but that's enough.
So you try to transfer the required number of opponents (mostly the classic race), then you finish up the time (classic battle with the tracks) and then you need to have a duel with the only opponent.
The police will be involved from time to time, which will continue to make all your efforts unpleasant.
News is passports out of the car.
Rather, it's just an interactive animation when Jack usually runs in front of someone, and you have to help him so that you print the right button at the right time.
It's nothing complicated.
But it's surprising that these passages are in the game much less than you would expect (in particular, maybe even three).
As a result, however, this is for the benefit of things, because this element is not likely to become annoying, and in the context of the above mentioned, it is in order to be among the elements that spoil the game.
The driver's model goes in the tracks of the previous parts.
This means that it's definitely no longer anyone today, but it can't be said that it would be an objection.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you'll have to look elsewhere.
But the more closely defined competition, the driving model here is still quite good, even though we could find better in competition.
Until then, everything's perfectly all right.
But problems are beginning to appear for some time.
Unlike the driver's model, it's no longer a collision model.
We don't expect this type of game to include complex distortions and collisions, but if you don't have the slightest idea of how your car behaves, then it's probably not all right.
Typically, when you drive or change cars in the usual operation, you can only easily lick each other, but otherwise in almost identical situations your car will end up in wild pyruets.
Or even a straight-up attack.
Thanks to the restart system, it doesn't really matter, but it's gonna break you down safely.
The restarts are solved so that if you break or go far off the track, you will be thrown back to the last catch point on the track.
However, restarts are only available in each race for five.
When you're exhausted, you have to start the race again from the beginning.
So it's more of a help if there's nothing going to happen than that you can rely on them explicitly.
Sometimes, however, even restarts won't help, they'll solve the need to learn a certain part of the race to remember.
The big rush of the game is that the same things happen often in the same places.
For example, some tips are needed in a specific way, otherwise you will not get into them in a short time.
Otherwise you will meet the "civil" cars again in the given place always in the same configuration whether you come there first, fifth, five seconds sooner or a minute later.
This is particularly frustrating in situations where you see between the two opposite cars the opponent easily passes before you, while when you get there, cars are already in such a position that you have to drive them or hurry them.
It doesn't matter when you come to them, because it's "calculated" so that the situation is always right in front of your nose.
Competitors have another advantage.
Throughout the play you will hit several places where you, no matter how time, will always pass the same opponent in the same place.
Most of it drops in the end of the game on the long bridge where you're going in the opposite direction.
The opponent must get in front of you, obviously, at any price.
If he goes ahead of you, then he's making your view of the anti-driving cars worse, so at first you're probably having a good time.
You can understand the intention to make the game more stressful and adrenaline, but the realization is so obvious that it will certainly destroy you quickly.
And it's a pity, because even in a simple driving model, playing fun and places is so much action that sometimes you don't literally get to watch where you fly.
And it doesn't matter whether it deserves a concept with fifty unique tracks, a number of races so that the bores won't have a chance, or anything else.
Untraditional idea is the exchange of cars during the race.
You have to pay attention to the gas pumps on the way, because you can change the car right there, although in the absolute majority of cases you are enough with what you just have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sportsmen are suitable for urban areas, strong American boars on equal roads and exotic supersports on technical rides, for example on clicked mountain roads.
The main history mode goes hand in hand and way of challenge, which are races in individual locations that you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also points of experience in your profile, which is common for challenges and stories.
To achieve a higher driver level, different objects are removed: start cars and end with backgrounds for profile.
At the same time, it is again connected to the online Autolog function, which compares your results with other players and provides other community functions.
One of the other difficult to understand is the situation of the last race in the story.
With your car you will get to the subway tunnel (wives) where you will marry it in the dark after your colleges (wives).
On the tachometer you see the numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (awake) and in the back comes a set of meters and uncompromisingly crushes you.
For a few more days, we'll have a discussion about if nobody really thought about it when making the game, or if the authors think we're such a big fool.
The technical page of the game is nothing extra, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in some cases even great.
It's freezing so that in some more depressing moments, the shooting is slowing down, and in some cases it's pretty tragic.
But it's mainly about a bigger number of participants if you don't have anything to do with the shot.
The audio page is fine and soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an attempt to enjoy the widest scale of the younger audience, a soundtrack was created from the category "every dog other village", but it can be assumed that because of listening to music, the game will probably not be purchased.
The overall impression from Need for Speed: The Run is so desperate.
If the game were to avoid completely unnecessary mistakes, then we wouldn't be afraid to say that The Run is the best part of the NFS in the last few years.
That's how the game works.
Well, fun is definitely good, but be prepared to make sure that your mistakes are going to shake your eyes with the power of the airport reflectors.
The UK Singing Councils will sing at the Student Summit concert
The association of the International Study Day and the anniversary of the Samet Revolution with the musical experience already offers the third festival of Festa Academy.
During this he is presented to twenty high school and high school singing congregations.

"The University of Karlov has a great share in the festival."
"Among the participating congregations is the Pêvecé Congregation of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Humanitarian Studies, the director of Václav Hampl will sit on the festival committee," said the leading organizational team Jakub Čaloun.
The top of the festival is a free concert of the high school congregations, which will take place on 17 November from 14 o'clock in space in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvic.
The program features the composition of a significant Czech jazzman Karla Rožičky Celebration Jazz Mass.

Detailed information will be found on the website of the festival www.festaacademica.cz
Ambassador to the EU Vice-President:
Czechs have the reputation of negative and Eurosceptic
"The Treaty of Lisbon has significantly disrupted the balance between individual institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a hard war."
"It will take five, six years before the situation gets a little stable, calm and before all the players get used to their new role," the Czech ambassador to the European Union Milena Vicenová began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
To the extent that it takes its motto "Early and openly about Europe" seriously, it has already shown in the first part of the lecture when it was able to describe the individual EU authorities and their relations in such a transparent and understandable way that a number of lecturers from the UK Faculty of Law could envy it.
Vice-President Van Rompuye also welcomed the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council:
"The criticism has recently emerged that it is irrelevant that it is a gray officer that he cannot play any part, and I must say that everyone has been inspired to say that he has done well."
"It is a person who can listen to the twenty-seven Member States and communicate with them perfectly and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
The new post of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained as an answer to the question, "Who is the European Union? What phone number should I call?", that is, as a significant step towards unification and greater readability of EU policy towards states such as China or India.
No one wants to stop the cheeses
Vicenna has also dedicated herself to the agenda that the European Council lives on, lives on and will live on in the near future.
The Czech Presidency has seen success.
The Czechs solved the emerging financial crisis, resolved the gas crisis, or organised summits for the Eastern Partnership.
The government's downfall at that time was marked by a great negative which had caused serious damage to the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
It was said to the Ambassador that "the fact of the frmol" was not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis that is being resolved today.
In addition, the new seven-year Union budget must be approved, which is making it much more difficult because of the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be modest and cost-effective, which sectors will benefit from which countries will be more and less supported, is all in the order of future negotiations.
She also reminded the Ambassador of her main slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "To Europe is understandable".
"I really don't like ugly shorts, foreign words, handcuffs that no one understands.
How does a citizen understand that there are really no curved or bulleted corn, bananas of various sizes in Brussels, or that someone really has to forbid us cheeses?"
He also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into European institutions.
Multi-speed Europe is waiting for us
According to the embassy, the Czechs have the reputation of Eurosceptics and people who notice more of the negative than the positive side of the matter.
Furthermore, it regrets the low representation of the Czechs in European institutions.
According to her, there are many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she then increased the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me, when Poland and Hungary come to me and the Slovak is approaching, then the Frenchman next to me will say, 'Hey, what are you meeting with your Visegrad Four again?' and he doesn't really care about it.
In the future of the Union, according to the Vice-Presidents, there are mainly strong new rules for budgetary policies in the Member States.
As a very real one, the concept of two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe, is more than a new "European Federation."
"We have the euro area and the country outside the euro area."
"We have the Schengen area, we already have an institution for enhanced cooperation."
"It was said for the first time that only countries that wanted to cooperate and those that didn't want to be left behind."
"These institutions will be more and it will be a strong two-speed Europe," Vicenová expects.
In this regard, it has also assessed the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye in the implementation of the principle that all issues having an impact on the Union as a whole are to be dealt with between all Member States, not only between the euro area countries.
Fire story:
Innovator IBM began its existence in the second century
If someone was looking for a word that most specifically expresses the IBM strategy, it would probably be "long-term".
For the general public IBM is a symbol of a technological revolution, it is perceived as very current, and yet it has been established for hundreds of years.
The foundation of this long term lay the first head of the company, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already broken the password that a number of world problems can easily be solved if people are willing to think.
His password " thoughts!" became so printed that the life of the future giant is going to take place (and also the name of the internal magazine that started dating in IBM in 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson's carefully built corporate culture.
"For us from IBM, long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and flourished for a hundred years because she remained loyal to her basic values and was not afraid to change everything else around her.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope that in the second century we will be able to achieve even more," said Samuel J. Palmisano, current director of the company for the year.
Designated system
Watson, in his 30 ’ s, had access to care for his employees, just like the company of Batja in the Czech Republic - people from IBM had a paid leave as one of the first American employees, insurance from the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a system designed to reward the best inventors and traders.
The same design has a long time IBM also has a relationship with the customer.
From the beginning, society was brilliant in the extraction of talent - as one of the first world companies to eliminate any discrimination, so she could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is that Palmisana will issue a woman - Virginia Rometty in front of IBM next year.
It has been in IBM for 30 years, so far it has remained the head of sales, marketing and strategy.
In recent years IBM has made so-called holes, online brainstormings, many of which form future strategies and innovations.
No wonder that ideas are enough - almost half a million people work in the company.
Institutions with a good name
A certain position in the business ensures the company's strong inner and outer image.
"From the beginning, IBM had a concept of an institution rather than just a technological firm," said Professor Harvard Business School Economist and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology firm, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology," added George Colony from Forrester Research's consulting firm.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating the market evenly.
IBM - or "Great Blue", as it is called because of its logo in the United States - has grown into one of the largest companies in the world for a hundred years.
It is probably the most widely used technology company - they develop hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services on a product scale from servers to nanotechnology.
She holds the most patents from all American technology companies and her five employees have won the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include ATM, payment card, financial swap, line code or floppy disk.
IBM became the second largest technology firm in terms of market capitalisation (the first Apple) when Microsoft appeared for the first time since 1996.
Forward View
Not all products and innovations hit the taste of customers and time - IBM failed for example to bet on its own OS/2 operating system, online service Prodigy or computer IBM PCjr.
"If your business is on the move forward, you cannot emotionally cling to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms - and if they don't work, then leave them.
Unlike the competitive Microsoft that basically stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Perspective technology
On IBM markets, the largest share of services is about five are software and hardware.
At the same time, in 1990, he was with more than half the most powerful hardware representative.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profitable assets worth $15 billion, while at the same time investing $58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies.
Investment has continued since 2008 when the first world financial crisis was overrun.
IBM is one of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who also increased investment during the great economic crisis.
So far, it seems that IBM is undergoing the current crisis without being affected.
The IBM share price has risen by 120 per cent since the beginning of 2008 and the company’s net profit is constantly growing.
The firm password of IBM is to change everything, just not its values.
Therefore, it can be expected that even if another crisis comes, this flexible giant will manage it.
History IBM: From the end of the cheeses after flight to the universe
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago, originally had a complex name Computing Tabulation Recording Corporation.
IBM took over until 1924 - originally the brand used for the branches of the firm in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the later IBM was the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They own the technology like the famous "peckers," that is, hours recording employees' arrival and departure.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also presided over the company's board of supervisors until 1930.
Flint hired the head of the Thomas J. Watson Competition Company to help him run the company.
The leader then defended the founder of IBM - Watson's ideas have so far built an invincible corporate culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as her name suggests, started with the production and sale of all-powerful machinery for business - from meat and cheese to cashiers.
During the first four years of Watson’s leadership, he doubled his turnover to $9 million and began to expand the company’s expansion into all world capitals.
Watson was so invincible to the company that, almost forty years later, his son, Thomas Watson Junior, disbanded her in the chair.
Under his leadership IBM started working on the development of artificial intelligence, developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA to fly to space - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous man's flight to the moon.
In the meantime, in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - a series of IBM System/360.
The classic "big," which became the computer standard of the time, called IBM 5150 came to market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold the Chinese computer production of Lenovo, on the other hand, bought a consultant part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to devote full advice and services with a high value added.
The strategy that has been paying off in the last three years is the concept of Smarter Planet.
Its aim is to make wise use of technology in even unplanned areas and to improve the situation, for example, in the transport or management of cities.
For the area of trade, IBM recently introduced the Smarter Commerce platform, which helps traders run the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history even abroad.
She founded her branch in then Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and there is also a research team at the world level dealing with voice recognition.
A runner about an unbelieving husband:
Iveta, leave this ass, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Richtářová (53) said it's over!
After her husband, Joseph Richtár (53), became not only a protector of Iveta Bartoš (45), but also a lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from a pink dream and return home.
But now to wait willfully, she has set clear rules for the next life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner anymore," explained Richtář.
When Darina Richtářová in summer provided asylum to Bartošova in her home, she probably didn't seem to end her marriage.
Even though Iveta moved out of town after 30 days, Pepa didn't leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
In time, Darina gave up on her husband’s efforts to make peace, and now she even gave him a good time.
The driver doesn't care who his wife's sleeping with.
If the Richter and Bartos were to break up once, his wife's hand would not be waiting for him at home.
"He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to live his life in our common house, no one will drive him away."
"But he will live, not as my beloved, perverted old ass, but as a man with whom I have certain ties," said Richtář, saying that she has already given up her husband and only lasts for mutual obedience.
Joseph's having Darina locked his back door, so far it's okay.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and I won't change it."
"The groom set up a paper marriage, and I respect it."
"The company goes on, I take care of repair, garden, real estate, I buy."
"We have a perfectly normal time with Darin, even if we don't share the beds together," Bleska Richtář said.
If Richter finds a new love too, she won't be able to defend it.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where he goes, who he goes with, and if he has a friend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take responsibility for everything," Joseph said.
The worst women's crimes: Do they concern you too?
When you ask men if they could name some typical women's crimes, they're usually all thrown out of the glove in one.
Dear ladies, do you know in the following lines where there are a number of female crimes that can make men perfectly shed blood in the veins?
Shopping
Does your second half count that you're dependent on shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one hat a week?
You're buying love and a lot in discounts?
Then, in your case, you can talk about buying as a crime.
Some women realize that they should at least cut their shopping passion a little.
But tell me, who would resist it just to walk around the store with clothes, look for good falling ends and then try them all (perfectly in different colorings) in the cabin?
Even though for most women shopping is a horse, for men it can literally be a hell.
Just remember how many times you told your husband to wait for you before you came in.
Continuous Dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I should forget at least five pounds - should I start practicing?"
"Do you like me at all?"
Doesn't that remind you of anything?
Is that right?
Then you belong to the women who are obsessed with what they look like.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are directly allergic to how their partners constantly complain about their looks.
The stronger the sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of this complaint, the more annoying the women are.
Order and purity in the first place
It's like an endless cycle.
Washes windows, drying, washing the dishes, washing the dust, shaking the baths - at least twice a week.
You're counting on your partner to put a dirty foot on a clean floor, to the children, to clean up the dirty washroom, and to take down the dirty living wall that you've been doing so much work with?
In case you are suffering from this "disgusting" thing, try to realize that nothing should be overlooked and the order and purity should certainly not be within the family's first place.
This harmless desire for cleanliness can endanger your relationships and family harmony.
Rolling
"You used workouts, throw them in the trash."
"Are you gonna take those old socks on yourself tomorrow?"
"The wet hole doesn't belong on the ground."
If you run into your partner like this several times a day, you know you'll be able to turn him off safely.
Of course, you don't mean anything wrong, but you want to make sure everything's okay.
Maybe if the men knew it, the women wouldn't have to get so drunk again...
Dyspnoea, pruritus
For some women, talk, gossip, but also insulting and socializing against someone.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to talk about things like who, where, who, how, and why.
Maybe every one of us is gonna let some little harmless raccoon or curse out there.
Hands on the heart, it's for all women.
On the other hand, they are the brunts of the worst grain, which they like and often tremble, if they turn everyone away and are for their surroundings - especially within the framework of the women's working group - particularly dangerous.
Jágr and Voráček helped assist with the victory of Philadelphia
Hockey attacker Jaromír Jágr participated in the NHL's Monday match with two assistance to the victory of Philadelphia 5:3 on the ice of Carolina and is again in the forefront of the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
In both cases, Claude Giroux, who added one more play and was declared the best player in the game, was drawn from the list of twenty-nine stars.
Two assistants in the match also recorded Jágrov's partner, Jakub Voráček.
After beating the foreign journalists, Járg claimed he was predicting a great evening for Giroux.
"Before the game, I told him he'd have a hattrick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes such a feeling will overtake you," explained Jágr, after whose action gave Giroux a goal from the first shot of the Flyers.
At a later stage, the second operation was followed by a Czech lead.
The Voráček beat out the Hurricanes wheel and presented it between the circles of the skating Maxim Talbot.
The second before the first stop was reduced in the weakening of the home player Patrick Dwyer, but the introduction of the second part again belonged to Flyers.
Especially the Giroux.
After working with Jágrem, he shot a third target, then shot him in the fourth branch of Wayne Simmonds.
"I love to play with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player in the league, but he certainly belongs to the best three," Jagr assessed his center.
"I would never have thought that at the end of my career I'd play with a hockey player like him."
"I'm happy about that."
"I want to play it."
"All those years in the NHL my teammates tried to play me, now it's turning," added Jágr.
Caroline from the fight still made the drama, the goal of Tuoma Routu and again Dwyer, who took refuge from a criminal shooting, got to the difference of one branch.
Another complication, however, did not allow Matt Read, who finished renumbering two to one.
"Excellently intruded in our band Proger."
"He ran the wheel, I picked up the speed, and (Read) went to the far end."
"I tried to hit him, and I'm glad it worked out," described the last line of the match from his point of view.
Philadelphia won the East Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Špratoek did not win the fight against Buffal, in the second third for injury in the upper part of the body.
The Candiens, along with the experienced bee, also lost two-way lead and lost after Penal Fire 2:3.
One of their trips didn't change Tomáš Plekanec.
The home coach, rather than the lost points, hated an extensive back row marodka, with only five defenders playing the game.
"It's bad."
"We only played the run with one experienced player, the rest were young."
"But there's nothing to do with it in the short term, we have to deal with it," Jacques Martin said.
"We've got a fight for the fight, and we couldn't resist it."
"We were supposed to simplify the game more, move the puke from our band."
We had gaps in it," added one of the defenders of P.K. Subban.
Czech blogger Ondrej Pavelec contributed 30 Winnipeg's efforts to win 5:2 over Tampou Bay.
About the goal of the Jets, who interrupted the five-pass series of losses, five different shooters were divided.
How fares have evolved since 1989
By 1989, only five state travel offices were allowed in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Traveling offices at that time sold in a vast majority of the country’s socialist blocs only because travel to the west was very limited.
The Czech tourists thus travelled on holiday to the sea to NDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Soči na Krym near the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
A major exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, however, the Yugoslav regime acceded to the West and Czech tourists' journeys to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the time of socialism was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely within socialist countries.
If a Czech citizen wanted to travel individually to Poland or the Soviet Union, for example, he needed a letter from that country, otherwise it was not an individual journey.
Traveling offices at that time also offered trips to the West, but it was necessary to stand in front of the night with a package or to have in the travel office "well-known".
It wasn't won anyway.
The so-called currency pledge, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not given to "politically unreliable people", who could not travel at all.
The Czech Republic's currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it was not possible to obtain funds (the Western currency) on the way to the West without a foreign currency promise.
However, far more often the Czechs spent their vacation abroad, which resulted in a large number of chats and chalapses that Czechs have made, and this habit survives today.
The journey of the Czechs has thus experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While by 1989 she was allowed in the NDR or Bulgaria by our maximum, she spent 4.5 miles abroad on leave in countries around the world.
The enormous paradox that we no longer realize today is that it was not possible for Croatia to travel freely until 1989, as it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
In the late 1990s, a visa requirement had been abolished in neighbouring Western European countries, starting with a huge wave of short-term visits, especially in Austria or Germany.
The Czechs couldn't afford to travel to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to watch for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, the Czechs ’ trips to parks in the states were burned because our incomes at the time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or a guesthouse.
The typical picture of Czech travel was at this time driving its own food, cans, salads, etc. to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of freely interchangeable Czech crowns, which our tourists could finally buy their Western currency freely after many decades.
However, our standard of living and therefore the average wages have risen, which has come to an end around 1997 at another important moment.
As a result of the increased demand for travel, since 1997, the travel offices have regularly begun to prepare charter flights, thus reducing the amount of discounts due to the possibility of airport flights compared to the past.
By the end of the 90's last century, the Czech Republic had virtually no connection with all the developed countries of the world, except the United States, which has further facilitated our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of revolving travel occurred immediately in 2000, when thanks to a significant demand from the Czech Republic, the first direct charter flight to exoticity was to Thailand.
From this year onwards, Czech tourists fly direct charters to warm distant countries each year, this winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are already visiting about 100,000 Czechs annually!
Another interesting moment in this period, symbolizing our revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States cancelled a visa for Czech tourists, and our country was definitely among the most successful countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs also spent more than half their abroad leave (50.3%) for the first time in history, and spent the first time in history for one foreign leave, including the cost of the place of residence more than 15,000.
Valna crowd is supposed to find the president, but again he's threatening the path
For nearly five months, Czech football is without a president and threatens that the successor Ivan Haška will not know the Czech Republic Football Association (FAČR) even after another extraordinary band, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburg.
There is still no agreement on which electoral procedure will be taken.
Without her, she won't even begin to vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
Interested in leading Czech football have Jindrich Reichl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paklík.
Hašek resigned from his job in June, and when he left, he called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
But in the era after The Hague, football went back to the lines between the two joint chambers, which are unable to agree with the joint candidate.
It was fully evident on 16 September when the new president was to be elected.
The delegates to the National House in Prague in Smych were unnecessary, because the meeting remained blocked and was not just a way of choosing.
There was no agreement, therefore, which has the right to vote on the group itself - whether only statutory representatives, or officials of the delegation with full power.
In this only point since then, there has been a partial agreement to which the recommendation of the Constitution on State and Law has also helped, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
But there are still disputes about the electoral order.
It is not too clear that even an executive committee, which, in its discussions, is no longer able to deal with any other matter, be it proper or extraordinary.
The view of the option of election has changed several times, but the neural point is still the same.
The question is, how to proceed in the 3rd cycle to exclude the possibility of pat?
"The issue is whether to proceed in accordance with the rules or to find another model," one of the three vice-presidents of FAČR Dušan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the management of the association.
According to the provisions of the proposed model in the third round, one of the candidates will win a higher percentage of support in the chamber for which he is a candidate.
The morale is supposed to be willing to resign to win a candidate who receives a higher percentage of votes from both chambers.
And the Czech side advocates the condition that the winner must gain at least two thirds of the advantage at this percentage.
"But then it would make no sense for the two previous rounds, it would completely deny the two-room concept," understands the objections of the Moravian Party of Freedom, according to which it would be best not to deviate and choose according to the current states.
Tomáš Paklík agrees with this in a somewhat surprising way, although it is estimated that the voting order is suitable for all the candidates most to Pelt.
"I wish it would be elected by state."
"In order not to think of any reprehensible nonsense as on the past wave assembly," said the owner of Victoria Plzeň, who is the first candidate and in his statements he was referring primarily to Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, the new president will know and believe that candidates will cooperate constructively in the future.
"All the passionately calming up of today's national team's approach to Europe's championship."
"Football will be happy again, it will be a greater willingness to cooperate," says an apple officer, who has the greatest experience with football management at both professional and regional levels.
Rachel's more protracted.
"I hope in the agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very disbanded."
"It's not between people from the Czech Republic and Moravia, but there are efforts to adapt regulations."
"This may cause the blockage of the vala crowd to come again."
"But I hope he wins a healthy mind," said Rachel.
There's no time left for the agreement of all the parties.
Some of the events were supposed to be played directly in Montenegro, but anyone who, whether a football general would be complete in the match.
A flight special in which they were to travel to Podgorica, among other things Vice-President Dalibor Kučer and Reichl, because he did not fly out of Prague in the morning because of a technical breach and sought a replacement for how part of the executive committee to transport the barage response to the scene.
Finally, there may be a decisive meeting at the ministerial level, which could possibly take place on Wednesday.
Minister of Education, Youth and Body Josef Dobeš would like to welcome the disbanded parties within the country's strongest sports association.
There is a lot of this in the game: State grant, the credibility of football, and the upcoming ČSTV rolling stock, which will solve the new direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
The package is about to be fought by the president, because he doesn't see a suitable candidate.
If the chief of footballers, Plzno Tomáš Paklík, had seen a strong candidate in front of an extraordinary crowd who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), he would not have joined the struggle for a top-ranking function.
"If a quality adept existed, I fight for him and I'm not going to choose."
"But in the present situation, no one has been able to find such a person," said the ČTK Paclík.
In the fight with Miroslav Pelt and Jindrich Reichl women Paclika motivation to try to stop Pelt, an alleged favorite choice, on the way to the front of FAČR.
Paklik also stresses that, in the event of his victory, he would only remain in the role of President until 2013, when the programme is a regular band.
In function, he would like to see an experienced and top manager who is not too attached to a football event.
"I spoke to some people who would come to mind."
"It was crazy for me when some said they didn't even want to identify with Czech football at the moment."
"That's what I'd like to change," he said.
Paklik's relationship with the President of Plzeň's Regional Football Association Roman Berbrem, a man with controversial reputation, who is known in the background as a powerful lobbyist, has the ability to influence the voting of delegates on the volleyball.
For Paklik, it's so unacceptable that Pelta is in the president's office.
"If he won, the current state would be preserved and nothing would move forward in football."
"In combination with the support of Berbra, who is a successful businessman, it would not have worked any more," Paclík said.
He is also concerned that Pelt's name was heard years ago by the envoys in the investigation of a corruption affair, from which Pelta came out without a penalty.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's victory would bring."
"And how would we look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, who is also taking over his previous sentence to "sell the Plenary Club if Pelta became president."
In case Paclík won the Thursday election, he would be able to imagine future cooperation with Pelta.
He also considers another candidate, Reichl, whom Paclik supported before the September round of applause, which ended with a failure.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to follow."
"He has great powers."
"I could imagine him as the chief of representation."
"But managerial would not be able to run an association."
"I also don't knock on my nose where I can't," said Paclík, who in September gave great attention to the fact that he stood up to the appeal of the decision-makers' commission in front of Luděk Macel, who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paklik claims he'd vouch for the management of the association.
He's been calling on his ability to run private companies, and since last year he's also head of Plzi, who, with his support in May, celebrated the prime league triumph.
"I have the strength to change something in the football environment to contribute to its certain cultivation."
"To limit the effects of some interest groups, which may tend to influence the disciplinary and appeals commission, which is starting to get into unpleasant situations," said Paclik, who is hiding his antipathy, for example, from the Spartan Chief Daniel Kretinski.
One of the priorities he would also consider is the tightening up of FAČR's relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, with which he would lobby at political peaks for more money from the lottery tax.
"It's one of the key things the new president should do."
"If gambling is taxed, as political parties say, then I understand their argument, but they have to say at the level where the money goes," he noted.
As a competition now Paklík does not take its connection to the Plenary Club, although they themselves claim that the President of the FAČR should be "on the other hand".
Pelta's connected to Jablonc again, Rachel to Prague Duckle.
"It's not perfect."
"But I don't see any point in bringing my stock to someone's shelter at the Plenary Club and coming back in a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised new FAČR positions that would exclude the electoral path
Two days before the rolling crowd of the football association, one of the candidates for President Miroslav Pelta promised that in the event of the election of the principle, FAČR would have new positions that would definitely rule out disputes over the electoral order in the future.
The Jablonsk official is optimistic before the Thursday meeting in Nymburg and believes that the pre-election fight will clearly determine today's possible success in football representation.
Pelta has already promised, before the election in September, that it is precisely for representation and financial recovery to concentrate in the event of an election.
In his election before the last round of elections, he decided to go at the last minute, so that two months' delay could be given to him to defend his ideas on the management of football and to present them in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been doing football for a long time and expect the president to know."
"He feels that it is the highest time for someone to lead an association," says a man who is primarily associated with the Apple Club, but who has worked in Sparta for a number of years and the executive board of the Association.
And that's why it's thought he has enough experience to run Czech football.
He is convinced that under current election problems, there is euphoria that dominated the government of Ivan Haška.
"Unfortunately, in the red wave group, opinions were approved that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If different interpretations were not allowed, we had the president since September," Pelta warned.
The recast of the most important document of civil society has been regarded as an exercise for delegates.
"If I become president, I will take it as a personal task and I am willing to assume my personal responsibility if it fails."
"It's a principle thing we can't be without," says Pelta.
He's still trying not to be out against his opponents.
Earlier, he had announced that he could imagine working with Jindrich Reichl, whom he recognized for his legal education, and well knew that his opponent would be his first vice-president.
He didn't even attack Tomáš Paklík for a long time, which, on the contrary, didn't leave a dry spot on Pelt.
"There's something going on in football over a year, he's already made some progress."
"But his attacks were undeserving and a lot of people were surprised by the way he campaigned."
"That's why a number of them now doubt his actual nature," said Pelta, an opponent, who remains faithful to the announcements he announced in September.
According to him, his most powerful weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest competitions until after the representation.
That's supposed to be an interpretative box of football.
"And I would also try to put an end to all of the affairs beginning with the Bohemian cause or the sounds of the last corruption scandal."
"I would immediately go to the private and state sector to secure enough money for the whole football," the Czech Republic said to a sixty-two-year-old candidate two months ago.
He also promised that his coming to the front of the football would mean no personal cleaning.
"I should first get to know the full numbers of individual employees," he pointed out to the Fear, where there is an understandable nervousness from the long run.
Through the current catastrophic scenarios, which are being carried out by the upcoming crowd, it is believed that on Thursday delegates will not go to Nymburg for nothing.
"If the only issue is how to vote in the third round, then we can move through it."
"Football needs confidentiality, and it only gets here by finally having its leader again," Pelta remains optimistic two days ago, perhaps the decisive day of her functional career.
Rachel promises that under him, FACHR would start working hard.
If the new president of the Czech Republic's Football Association had been elected vice-president Jindrich Reichl on the fourth round, many people in the association would not be pleased.
Because Rachel promises that in the event of his election, she will start working hard.
He wants to introduce systemic changes and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for the individual football areas.
He also promised to resolve the Bohemian case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football and continue the work that former President Ivan Haszek started.
"As president, I'd like to devote myself to football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through representation, professional football, performance football after youth."
"But that's not what I'm saying, I'd do everything myself," said Rachel in a conversation for the ČTK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the powers of the Executive Committee so that each member is assigned to certain areas."
"And I'll give you the hard work to get your football in each of these segments to move about a mile ahead."
"Many people would probably not be happy because they would start working really hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he thought he wouldn't run again.
"I'm known to be working 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I will not have people behind me who will always throw sticks under my feet and question every step of my life," he explained why he hesitated.
"But many people told me I shouldn't give up, because then they would give up others."
"It's a trust I can't just throw away," he said.
It also motivates him to continue in the work he started with Haske.
"In those two years a big piece of work has been done, and I don't want to throw it away."
"There are processes launched that will sound in a few years, and I don't want anyone to stop them," he said with concern that in the event of the election of another candidate, Miroslav Pelty, the situation on the bond might return until the time before Haskem.
"I believe in systematicity, and that's a thing that I don't think Mirek Pelta can."
"He's the one who's mostly tied up with people who would make football so he'd be just for the chosen ones."
"I can count a lot of things, but certainly not that I'm making a lot of money."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to do football for everyone, because then they'll all have a good time and not just your choice," Rachel noted.
He's also claiming to be only the Czech president.
"Even though some people are trying to say the opposite, I plan to do the maximum for Moravian."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second league would be divided into a Czech and Moravian part, whose winners would go to the first league."
"There would not be such a current situation when there are only three Moravian totals in the league, which is a problem towards the young players in Moravia," Rachel said.
Since the chief of the Plenary Club Tomáš Paclík was also involved in the fight for the president, Rachel is not likely to estimate her election chances.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me as Vice-President and sees that I have clear success," said Reichl, who considers saving tens of millions of crowns in unfavourable contracts, negotiating television contracts and negotiating a lottery law.
On the contrary, he's giving his spouse the impression that he doesn't pull the tie for one rope.
While Pelt declares that he is "disqualified from returning Czech football confidence", the second of Paclik's rivals is considered a strong candidate who has football what to offer.
"No one can doubt that he's done a great job in Plzi this year."
"If he had been elected, he would have continued in the things that Ivan Haszek started here and would not, in principle, have changed his personal position in the commissions."
"He wouldn't want to do it for his own good," said Richl's rival.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Jump to Blue
Julia Stanek
From the view of Ufona, the swimming pool in Budapest: Anyone who travels to Europe can enjoy his blue miracle - and after visiting cities or travels let his tired feet rest in thermal baths.
The book will show where wellness is at the water's most beautiful.
When Iris Meder appeared in the past one and a half years on the open road, she should not have missed her purse: her swimsuits.
The sign of the water, looked up into the height of the artificially made dome, swam against the marble well (I am setting up a little naked boy, the child (with wings)) waiting for her on the edge of the pool and admired the carefully restored session swimming pool.
If she liked some swimming pool, she put it in her brain in her notebook - including with remarkable details about the way the building was built and the history of the building.
More than 200 sailors have studied this way the historical architecture of Meder and now presents them in his recently published book "Badefreuden (Beautiful of bathing)" : People's swimming pools in Munich, the historical palace of sailors in Schwarzwald, "Hard core of concrete buildings" in Taunus.
13 countries led her "The Way to the Most Extraordinary Spas in Central Europe": next to Germany, Austria and Switzerland she visited localities in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old Germany is a real enthusiasm for a floating culture.
With sport it's too much to move, says Meder - just in the water it's something else.
The only thing to worry about is that fand swimming must be satisfied with blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while health runners can smell the elusive smell of smurf forests or listen to the cheerful whiting of birds in the park.
"One day I asked why the swimming pools must always be so noble," says Mrs. Meder living in Vienna.
"That's how I started gathering nice swimming pools."
Water level doubles architecture
Spaling in the jumping pool and essential oils for the sauna - the weather factor is therefore so great that it concerns all the senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, they could be the real feeder for the eyes: "A man has a place in a pool of water."
"But it's transparent, on the other hand, but it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is optically duplicated: high knee, pestre tiles, skokansk wreaths.
Maloformat image link "Badefreuden (Beauty of bathing)" provides 190 pages of everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of historic oasis wellnes - but primarily it inspires the desire to jump into the blue.
The remarkable specimens discovered Mrs. Meder's sailing collector during her search in Hungary.
Alongside the beautiful healing pools, like 100 years old Séchenyi pools in Budapest, she found water with nitrogen content in the original beauty cave (a cave in Miskolc-Tapolca) and thermal baths whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in the form of a glass building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberene).
A beautiful view of this offers many heated swimming pools under the broad sky in Switzerland and Austria. As long as a person has from the Curysian indoor swimming pool in the eyes of the whole city, the outdoor pool in St. Anton can be seen on the snow covered Arlberg - and: in the paired bathrooms there is a window from which you can watch movement on a ski lift.
Perhaps the most remarkable design of the pool awaits spa guests in Langenfeld: Aquapark Ötztal looks like a ufo that just landed in the Alps.
From the three tops of the open slopes in the winter, a couple climb up until the background of Mount Ötztal reaches the sky.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Not every pool collector, Mrs. Meder, went up in the pool and smelled chlorine into the flu.
Many thermal baths are feeling after cheese, in the spas of Arpád in Hungary's Békessaba, it smells like hot oil to the point that one hardly believes that he has entered the treatment pool.
The smell comes from a water containing alkaline hydrocarbons, which is almost black and whose deposits are applied to the skin as soon as only a person enters the pool - a somewhat unique experience of wellness.
However, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful pools: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and air-conditioning pool Luhačovice, she hit the closed site.
In 1902 the architect Dušan Jurković designed the bathroom was closed.
When Mrs. Meder looked at the windows of the red-and-white-yellow sequential buildings, she saw the moaning flower growing between the tiles.
They stood opposite it in the magical swimming pool in Schwarzwald: in Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These bathrooms already have three stages of construction; one can discover not only the novel elements that come from the time of their birth in 1844, but also the maurice blue in the style of Alhambra, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995 Palais Thermal is Mrs. Iris Meder's favorite spa resort, not just because it comes from Schwarzwald.
"It's already some kind of performance to combine the various construction structures into such a beautiful complex," says Mrs. Meder.
In such a palace, sinking into a thermal pool is obviously a border matter.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank lets you check the Commodity Trade
Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank leave his business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the head of the group wants to bring the consequences.
Hamburg -
It is clear to the public that 84% of Germans consider one study unacceptable for banks to speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of the respondents even require Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions to step out of this trade because it is deepening the problems of the poorest world.
That's the result of the Fors poll on consumer organization's mandate to Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann points out that global commodity stock exchanges are priced at a high price, and the banks are therefore sharing the world's hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is directed specifically against Chief Deutsche Bank Joseph Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were designed to ensure that traders provided against price fluctuations.
However, most experts agree that the capital market participants in the interest of high-risk trade refrained from supply and demand - and profited at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, he responded to Ackermann's criticism: he promised that the results would be checked and said that no trade "is worth the good reputation of Deutsche Bank in bet".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group on foodwatch-Report controls.
The audit is to be closed by the end of the year and the results will be presented to Deutsche Bank - together with a recommendation on how to load it.
At the end of January, representatives of the banks then want to know what the consequences will be.
In the end, there could be a reduction in commodity trade or even a complete refusal.
Ackermann works with self-help on his image.
The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but at the same time strengthened his criticism of the financial sector: "The growing food prices are particularly drastic, as banks today are damaging to the general good."
Let Ackermann, as the highest bank lobbyist, receive responsibilities.
"Deutsche Bank must cut out of its portfolio all items where money is used for food price bets," Bode said.
"Wonderfully, whether Mr. Ackermann is about the hunger of suffering people or the fame of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's preview appears at first glance as surprising, but it is clear that the group leader would like to leave the perfect picture a few months before his departure from the office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the representation would not go to the supervisory board otherwise than planned.
By turning away from controversial agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And he doesn't have to worry about possible losses - he should finally advise his successor.
Each other would make an investment in raw materials
Foodwatch is trying to keep high pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 internet users have been participating in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, he published a poll by Bode, in which the Forsa Institute interviewed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
It is only 11 per cent, according to this, that Deutsche Bank is offering investments that are linked to food prices.
Many banks would also have personal consequences if they knew that their bank was involved in such transactions: each other would, as a result of the survey, make all investments in which money flows into speculation with raw materials.
43 per cent would warn known to such a bank, 49 per cent would indicate that they were thinking about expressing their account and moving to another institution.
21st century house in Vienna
Moved Pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
History of architecture with peaks, falls and happy endings: The Austrian pavilion from the World Exhibition in Brussels in 1958 won the prizes, became a Vienna Museum, remained empty and deserted.
Now it's open again as an exhibition house.
When burning for modern martial architecture, for clear forms, glass halls, bold blasts and new building materials that are typical of the faith in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition is an outstanding and celebrated example.
Schwanzer's pavilion was then awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and impressive steel and glass construction.
The building is still considered a milestone of modern architecture.
He celebrated the architect so that he also built the Austrian pavilion for the next world exhibition.
With his legendary four-wheel BMW palace plus as a key to the side building in Munich, he finally celebrated internationally in 1973.
Its temporary exhibition building, designed pavilion after the world exhibition, was located in Schweizer Garden at the Südbahnhof (South Station), renovated and opened in 1962 the Museum in the 20th century - it was named the "House of the 20th century".
But it was not suitable for the museum of the building, either spatially or technically - there were no walls to hang artistic exhibits, no suitable climate.
However, it was used until the current art came to a new stop in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and has been more and more chatting.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz has reconstructed the pavilion, now bears the title "House of the 21st century" and will be used in the future as the Museum of Current Art.
On Tuesday evening, the Museum Belvedere will open the first exhibition - a happy intention in every respect.
The new beginning of Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became the new director of the Belvedere Austrian Gallery in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a leading historical art with a significant career, including in a young carnival, later in Sotheby's, Guggenheim's Museum and as the founder of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, has placed considerable reconstruction in politics and monuments, provided public funds and private funds and determined the use.
In addition to the current art, the works of the glass maker Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited with the same foundation, a café and a library should be created, and an office building should be built to do so.
Close surveillance, low budget.
Then Krischanitz was the ideal siege to be carried out.
Not only did he significantly reconstruct and expand the sessional buildings of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna and won the competition, but he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and Pavilion was for him "an extremely important place", where he watched the exhibition "almost every weekend".
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its greatness and ease when he moved to Vienna and changed its use.
In the process of reconstruction, there were far greater problems: the building was "catapult for energy", says Krischanitz.
The profile of the glass facades were replaced by the glass fibers of the insulated insulation glass and the glass roof was replaced by the special safety glass.
Cold steel bridges have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been repaired.
Two underground floors have provided a place for new use, the left lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, leads to the entrance of the bridge - almost new building, but still the proud Schwanzer pavilion.
The original entrance door has been preserved, the building is ground in an old red-colored anti-corrosive tone.
And the cinema is even the same as it used to be.
And it's all under close supervision of the memory office and the low budget.
"Frequently the material had to be found, which is good and cheap and also liked the memorial office," Krischanitz says and points to the broken floor of the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
It's hard to say it was with a pavilion "who came here from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, a typical "drop-in-the-City-history".
Such architecture seems to be "always in the wrong place" and still wants "to be proper self-conscious."
In this case, however, the House is not in an inappropriate place for the 21st century, as an urbanist happy coincidence has occurred: around Schweizer Garten there is a newly designed "City District near the Main Station" with office and residential houses.
And perhaps there's another happy coincidence: in the 21st century, the house could receive support from another Krischanitz building, since the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporäre Kunshalle and, as you can see, it's already one with the city of the neighborhood in the settlement in Schweizer Garden.
The road is planning a package for the winter crisis of millions
The road has reached a crisis plan to prevent train accidents in the winter period.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It'll cost millions.
In the fight against winter train accidents and delays, Deutsche Bahn issues more than 70 million euros in news this year.
The Bild reports have been prepared in advance by calling on the internal group plan to calculate by 2015 a total investment of around EUR 300 million.
It is intended to improve the use of trains and rail networks under extreme weather conditions.
It is planned, inter alia, to double the number of internal and external workers by 16,000 to remove snow on railway facilities and trains.
The aim is to remove the entry point to start operations and 90% for the operation of the required take-offs over four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, chief Dr. Rüdiger Grube warned after meeting at the highest level with government and industry representatives before train accidents and delays also during this winter.
In the last winter, there were significant problems in passenger transport because, among other things, there was a lack of reserves under difficult weather conditions.
Thus, many new regional trains have been waiting for the approval of the Federal Railway Authority for years.
Furthermore, there is a delay in transporting ICE trains
The road has not been able to cope with the fact that ICE train repair is likely to be more frequent when an ICE train arrives at the main station of Cologne to destroy the repair.
Deutsche Bank pays a million fine in the United States
After a riot around Chief Joseph Ackermann, he comes to new trams in the United States: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions of damages there.
As if Deutsche Bank did not have enough problems at home, the business in the field of his past in the United States is still under way: the Frankfurt Institute is paying $145 million in one balancing operation (106 million) to settle the bankruptcy disputes of five large corporate banks in the course of the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgages.
The financial market regulator of the NCUA calculates a number of large banks that have deceived social banks with false promises to buy financial products; that the risk is likely to be reduced.
Such papers have lost much of their value during the crisis and the banks have collapsed with them.
"We are satisfied that we could solve the issue without having to drag the parties to court," said the spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank doesn't admit any guilt.
It also applies to Citigroup, who committed to paying $20.5 million.
The president of the NCUA Debbie Mattz welcomed the meeting of both monetary institutions.
National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for corporate banks in the United States and assists in banking to protect customer claims.
The NCUA is trying to get compensation for the damage caused by billions.
Now the completed equations are the first of their kind.
The regulator also relied on other major banks and complained about JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
In the case of suspicious mortgages, it is called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble collapsed in 2007, a number of financial companies became doomed.
In September 2008, at the end of the financial crisis, the US Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed her mind.
Even though it happened a few years ago, the banks are now blowing up a sharp wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities have made numerous complaints to make corrections or raise doubts.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) dropped the biggest wave of complaints.
According to 18 international banks, two U.S. state finance companies dealing with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's properties in mortgage transactions amounting to about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to face FHFA's claim, which is about more than $14.2 billion in total from 2005 to 2007.
The Supervisory Authority requires that the Frankfurt Institute be responsible for "substantial losses", but does not specify an exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as uncondemned and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett enters IBM with 10 billion
Buffett's financial guru invests heavily in the IT subnet of IBM.
Since March he's bought a stock worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, a significant American investor, Warren Buffet, has always stated that he will not invest in IT and computers, because the long-term development of companies will only be difficult to predict.
However, he has now read the business reports of IBM and changed his opinion on investments in the industry.
He had to understand a long time ago that IBM was offering services and operating computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
Warren Buffett's investment in the financial world is considered fit for knighthood.
As a result, it is now known as Sir IBM's maternal horn.
Because Buffett has announced in the US economic broadcaster CNBC that since March he has purchased an IBM share of $10.7 billion.
His Investment Holding Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 per cent.
Buffett says IBM didn't know anything about his engagement yet.
He praised the management that tried to achieve the economic crisis even with good results.
"You did a great job," Buffett said to the strategy.
For a long time IBM has been betting on lucrative IT services such as the operation of computing centres.
More than 100-year-old computer forwarder also offers software and advice as well as executive computers for companies.
Buffett has been avoiding technology companies to this day.
It claims to invest only in companies whose activities are also understood.
Instead, Buffatt sat down after the freight railway, after the oil manufacturer or after the machinery.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway owns around 80 own subsidiaries also participated in a number of major groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, former Municher Rühr.
The 81-year-old man took over a small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 60s last century and built one of the most valuable companies in the world with wise investments.
Still, his way of life is modest.
That's why it's a cultural position for many investors all over the world.
His almost unmistakable sense of making money brought him the nickname "Omaha Miracle" (Omaha Miracle).
When Buffett's investment became known, IBM's stock rose by one percent before the storm started.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, has a total price of more than $220 billion on the stock exchange and is put together with Apple and Microsoft for the most valuable technology companies in the world.
In Microsoft, so many Buffetts, he wouldn't want to come.
Founder Bill Gates is his trusted friend.
The threat is corrosive
After the discovery of "Bunny in Zwickau", the Turkish media doubts the German rule of law.
News is even talking about "blood ideology", which is now alive again.
The murders of eight small Turkish entrepreneurs and one Greek from 2000 to 2006 were legally extremist.
In Turkey and within the German-Turkey population in Germany, fear and concern were reacting to this report.
For many of the German Turks are returning to fear, which has long been regarded as dead: since the firefights in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a legal extremist background.
That there is xenophobia in Germany, however, there has never been any doubt.
However, the legally disclosed extremist network reveals a range that can no longer be observed for a long time.
"Is there a blood ideologie again?" the headlines of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk said.
On the other hand, the Sabah news points out that one of the offenders should be a secret police officer for the protection of the constitution and fears that German authorities could also be involved in the legal radical cause.
The Turkish municipality of Germany responded with a considerable response: she recalled a weekend of demonstration of silence in front of Brandeburg's defense of the victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish municipality in Berlin, together with the German and Turkish politicians, recalled the commemorative act of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish Association Agreement.
In happy colors, a shared life was staged - as a history of success.
A series of Turkish media reports here: "Dear Germany to the 50s" is the title of an article in the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Also, the issue of the letter "Hürriyet" for Germany cannot be taken away from this thought connection.
"It's starting to dawn," the column title of Ahmet Külahci sounds.
It stresses that people who paid taxes and paid their work were murdered and made an important contribution to the restoration of Germany.
The most critical is discussed in the German Internet forums the police procedure and its late success in the investigation.
Why did the German authorities not come up with a long time ago to search for suspects in the right-wing extremist circles, the authors are amazed.
So many are presented at least rhetorically ready to use drastic means: "If the activity continues to be so superficial, there will be nothing more for immigrants than their own defence and weaponry".
"That'll be the best self-defense."
"The quality of the explanation and proportionality of the punishment of the entire network depends very heavily on the inner peace in Germany," says "Selen".
Which means if the domestic peace in Germany is threatened, the murders in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s explain.
The photo of the burning site in Solingen is deeply engraved in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
Because no other event has made it clear to the living Turks here that there is a grave threat and to the Germans that disbelief and retreat can lead to legal violence
However, the assassinations made the Turkish side more sensitive to the feeling of mutuality.
Do Not Repeat Past Errors
The Turkish press then criticised the failure of the German policy after the assassinations: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in Mölln who survived.
After the firefight in Solingen, he sent a compassionate telegram to the Turkish state president, but he was allowed to represent his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel in his speech, at a sad celebration in Cologne, calculated in his speech what charges the Turks were paying.
Just like a man's value is measured according to the amount of his tax.
The current Turkish media report shows once again how deep the mistrust of many German Turks is in the present state law.
In addition to the effort to clarify and re-evaluate the law of extreme terrorism in Germany, this calls for open words this time.
The scandal bank at the Curysque Lake
Europe's best-in-one bank does not have a seat in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS suffered from a financial crisis almost bankruptcy and from then on from one crisis to another.
Now some German has to compare it.
Well, that's certainly not what Axel Weber thought.
After his loud departure from the leadership of the Spolk Bank, it became known in July that it will enter into almost the same spectacular new employment in 2013: the President of the Governing Council of the Swiss Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative step in the career.
Axel Weber was pleased publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly gained solidarity and said friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"The UBS has reached the turn."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villeger and Oswald Grübel."
But in September, it was clear that everything would be completely different.
One UBS dealer in London went through all the bank's security systems and wasted about EUR 1.7 billion.
The head of the representation of UBS Oswald Grubel, not only a registered banker in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the President of the Board of Directors of UBS has been as strong as ever - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already become known that Weber bank has been allowed to advise since February 2012.
And the presidency of the Governing Council will be taken over by May - not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
It'll be tough for Axel Weber.
He's not a banker, he's a professor of economy and an emission banker, and he'd probably need time to work.
Then we take responsibility for the bank's strategy, which just once again proved that it deserves the title "Bank of Europe's biggest scandals"
Because UBS, however, is huge - until recently, has been the world's largest asset manager - but has been slandering from year to year from one scandal to another.
Nothing, it seems, the proud Swiss bank will not be saved.
It started out as a financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS enjoyed excellent reputations.
The image of a quiet and solid but also intelligent asset manager is combined with ambitious goals: she also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
So UBS 2007 fixed on one side with $1.6 billion more money for rich customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, she went as an investment bank into the biggest bank league in the world.
That made sense.
A former banker and a later long-term professor of banking in Curychu Hans Geiger says, "I always told my students at that time that UBS was a good bank model."
"From today's point of view, you ask yourself, "How could I have just been wrong?"
He was very wrong.
For the first time in 2007, it was evident that something in UBS was missing correctly.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, who has so far been regarded as a highly intelligent and also a brilliant banker, retreated surprisingly.
A few months later, he realized why he left.
The bank's investment division wasted Subprime papers and had to write down billions.
To stop this, UBS warned of an increase in capital of really 13 billion francs.
That is why it has actually found investors, however, that it would have recently covered its nose: an opaque Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so discreet that no one knew its name.
But it was just the first attack.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to admit new billion losses, the President of the Management Board Marcel Ospel, 2006 the second best paid board in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS was faced with its misinvestment in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be saved by the state.
The National Bank bought ten billion problem securities from UBS, and the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs on a mandatory variable bond, which could be a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it has such a large bank in its territory.
Finally, the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 was more than five times the performance of the Swiss economy (see picture).
"One more time we couldn't save UBS," says bank expert Geiger.
The first disaster is followed by the second one.
For several months, UBS has capitalized on this in a tax dispute with America and has shown willingness to issue the data of rich customers who, if possible, have been taxed by banks.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million - as a return of unauthorized profits from these transactions, including bribery.
By doing so, UBS found itself more or less open that it was helping to reduce taxes.
At the same time, she lost something that was reprehensible to her capital in the competition for rich customers: a saint of discretion.
After this scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer what was before.
Following the resignation of the Head of the Representation and the President of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customers' money.
So the bank lost its credibility over the course of several months in both central business areas: in investment banking due to bad speculation and asset management to help reduce tax.
And just when it calmed down again, just when it was thought that UBS had recovered again, this unfortunate trade anababage came in here: the only dealer wasted 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
And it is clear: with risk management in investment banking, this is probably not yet in place.
"Adololi's case has probably found that the risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, an economist and a financial professor at the University of Zurich's Banking Institute.
The financial director of the large German banks is also sure: "The UBS problem is that it does not control risks."
At the same time, it was precisely the idea of taking care of the Swiss bankers long ago to become observers of the world's big assets: no too high a risk, so the security of the money - also from this side of the Alpine Republic has broken the world again.
Treasures of Swiss banks have become a symbol of unsurpassable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly quality chocolate.
The UBS Centre in Curych still fits into a cliché of good Swiss private banks - it's just a little bigger.
It's already classic.
The bank has its main seat in the Kyrgyz Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to the Lake Curys, which is framed by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the rentals of shops are among the highest in Europe.
Clothing like Tiffany's will be found here among Swiss traditional shops like Sprüngli sugar shops.
For centuries now, Swiss banks have been living here: from the National Bank through the Palace of Credit Suisse to the elite private bank like Julius Bär.
UBS is entering the reception hall with heavy rotating doors.
Inside are walls covered with marble, facing them with powerful leather chairs, next to the bank's logo a big direction to "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for: security.
However, this idea was sometimes suppressed or betrayed by the Swiss banks, both the Swiss Grand Banks, UBS and Credit Suisse - as one small Swiss private bank chief discovers.
His name would rather not be read in the newspapers, he would finally close up, like all Swiss bankers, as well as both big banks.
UBS has probably increased too much, finding out - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Americans have also expanded.
The Swiss probably don't have anything to say about it anymore.
"And if they had, they would have adapted to the English ways long ago."
Indeed, it was England's investment banking, which UBS changed, that led to its first high profits and then the defeat: no European financial institution lost as much money as Switzerland Grossbank in the jungle around Subprime.
October 15, 2008 was a obvious disaster.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of a small seven-million-nation country took on the greatest rescue action in the history of its people," writes author Lukas Hassig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros were approved by politicians to save from bankruptcy by the large bank.
How could that happen?
If he's talking to Swiss bankers, he sees a problem in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss major banks joined a powerful group.
A bank that was already too big for small Switzerland - and was still growing.
At the same time, it was helpful that both different bank predecessors of UBS were complemented: one rich but sleeping bank in Curych with a heavy asset management and poorer, but internationally more involved.
Suddenly, internationalised investment bankers came to the advantage of a lot of money that could solve a big roulette.
Two names are associated with this rise in UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS and Marcel Ospel Group from 2001 to 2007, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a team of futures," says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, humble man who knows a lot about models and statistics and Ospel, a man who's running his feelings around the stomach that's been completely developed from banking science."
But Ospel relied on Wuffli at the end.
And at the end, Wuffli probably admitted decisive mistakes: "You probably thought his models were real," says Geiger.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Clearly, pride has been a thing of the past.
UBS employees clearly remember the meetings of the leading staff, on which the group leader Wuffli repeated the same password again: Fight Goldman Sachs from the throne down.
The US bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She said "League Tables," a serial who documented the success of the bank at that time.
In it, UBS was trying to place it all the way up.
It's been a few steps.
In the foreign exchange and stock trade, she took part in the games at the top.
However, business advisors who have been entrusted emphasize one weakness: In international interest trading, in the "Fixed Income" banking language, there is probably a big gap behind the largest banks.
UBS probably has gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close this gap, the UBS decided on an adventure that almost became a reality.
Hunger after growth, both the bank itself and its fund have invested in securing the risks to the American investments of Subprime.
It developed into a powerful machine that packed valuable papers into American mortgage loans and transferred further - but it also kept its own risk.
Also when the other banks were long looking for the east.
"In the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was in flames, UBS was buying," says bank expert Geiger.
The size of the euphoria, the depth of the fall.
One manager after the other had to leave when trying to clean up was harder than he thought.
The positions at UBS have become a catapulting seat, and to this day they have been hopped.
Whoever runs the big bank now has almost impossible work to do.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that all the close business models have disappeared.
Bank expert Geiger already has the idea: End of investment banking, concentration on property management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to go that far.
But the investment banking is going to kill hard, so clear it's now.
Next Thursday, the new head of the bank of Sergio Ermotti wants to present the world with his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italy was understood only as a transitional solution when the bank suddenly broke up with its predecessor Grubel.
In the meantime, he sat down: He had a long time to run UBS stores, reported to the Turkish bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank to return to its position in the mid-1980s.
The 3500 seats are jammed.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who's her?
What does he want to make money for?
These are questions that Axel Weber is already asking.
Publicly, she's just saying she's going to be in Cury's apartment.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on the US stock exchange.
The threatening recession in Europe has freed US investors from the courage to start a week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome did not achieve the intended impact.
The industrial production on the continent ingested in the womb the hope of stabilizing the debt crisis.
General relief of the exchange of government in Rome and Athens could not be imposed
The euro has dropped towards the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass last week was considered half full, not half empty - now but penetrated to the front problems again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
In particular, the financial values were found on the sales cards.
The Dow-Jones standard values index noted a 0.6 per cent decrease in trade at 12,078 points.
During the course of the trade, the barometer was located between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The broader S&P-500-Index ended at 1251 points, decreasing by one percent.
The Nasdaq technology storm index lost 0.8 per cent and came out of trading with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, Dax had a reduction of 1.2 per cent among 5985 readers.
The industry in 17 countries using the euro has significantly reduced its production and prepared for the end of the gap.
In September, companies produced two percent less than in the previous month, as reported by the Eurostat Statistical Office.
"We are no islands, but depend," said Steve Goldman of the Goldman management.
Europe may not recover so quickly from the recession; moreover, there are other signs of banking weakness.
The investment legend of Warren Buffett just confirmed this view: he said in a CNBC interview that it would probably not be clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis.
That's why it's probably too soon to invest in European state loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett left the old principle for decades and entered the American technology industry.
Its investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM increased the share rate of the traditional group and allowed it to rate at first almost one percent higher against the trend in the course of the trade.

Smart holes expand in cities
In many places the hawks are placed full of "problem birds": however, these highly intelligent animals cannot be pushed out of the city long ago, experts say.
Some like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: the gates are already part of the city’s image for centuries, yet in some municipalities there are people’s complaints about the uncleanness and noise caused by animals.
However, there is no remedy against "problem birds" so far under surveillance.
Havanas are probably not able to escape the city anymore, experts have announced at the first Symposium on Gates in East Africa Leer.
There, experts from all over the community consulted on possible eastern areas.
Looking for alternatives in cities
The nature defenders also drove the problems of cities from the exodus of specially protected fields: The use of chemistry in agriculture is likely to destroy the traditional area of life to an increasing extent.
Hunting, growing building and planting typical trees for nesting birds make life difficult.
The crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 nesting pairs are, inter alia, in the Westphalia Soest, in the northwest, inter alia, in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Brém and Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project to kill crows during the rural period called for a negative title.
Critics have called for the capture of animals into the traps of birds and the killing of the claws especially brutal.
"Normal expulsion, fear, doesn't bring anything," so much the urbanist and landscaper Werner Klöver from Leer found.
The removal of nests by spraying water or planting trees often has undesirable consequences, said also environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are retreating, the great colony is smearing and dividing into other places."
Fear can only be thought of as an exception in hospitals, pensioners or schools.
"We have to live with them, we're not getting away from them."
Without the surrounding area, the problem of cities cannot be solved, was the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
The combination of the removal of animals from sensitive habitats and their attraction to settle in other locations is thought to be a combination.
"Information table instead of chain pills" advocated the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens because of a completely different treatment with animals: "One fever in the face we can finally stop by ourselves."
Ms. Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein Ascherberg's scientific discovery of the path on which they provide the information table on the life of a highly intelligent Havran full.
In the meantime, the project is to accept tourists.
Also at the criticism of the noise caused by the bird, Mrs Jürgens had her own opinion: "Here is every volume of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and lustfulness of animals are legendary: the Havrans do not only use help to reach the Paml, but even as a help, they will make their own tool.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge have recently tested the behavior of the four ungulates, how far the bird's intelligence reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that the stones must bring together the structure to reach the larvae.
Without great training, they knew what size and shape the stone must have to cause the collapse of the flat.
In the second attempt, anointed crows had to solve a more flexible problem.
In a barbed - down war, researchers placed a small jar of larvae.
In turn, the birds could not reach their own advantage.
However, the researchers put pieces of wire there.
All four animals formed a hook, which was used as a tutor to hunt from the pot of the container.
Three of the four ravages of the field have even succeeded with an ambush.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal for the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks have not risen.
Favorite Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland with the 2012 European Championship.

Jiracek scores for Czech Republic
Finally, he stood in the center of decision-making Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding.
After the action against Helder Postig in Bosnian criminal territory, Stark decided for Schwalbe and gave the Portuguese a yellow card. (36.)
On the other hand, Stark carried out a controversial criminal coup following the action of Fabio Coentra, which Misimovic certainly changed.
But after the break, the European Deputy Master of 2004 explained everything with four trumps.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also completed the last doubts in the 81st minute.
This is what the European Master of 1976 will do in the fifth row for the European Championship.
Coach Michal Bilka's team with legionary Bundesligy Michael Kadlez (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomáš Pekhart (1. FC Norimberg) were lucky and had to overcome a terrible second in the initial phase.

Black Hora had its greatest opportunity when the Duo of Steven Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic fired in the 40th minute from the border of criminal territory just around the Czech branch.
After the break, it had to be the first time to save the place of the already defeated Czechs World Class Bracelet, again reducing the attacker FC Soul (50.).
The branch shortly before the conclusion finally explained everything.
Turkey was missing a football miracle from Zagreb at the time.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turkish in Zagreb did not exceed 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink almost certainly has his place on the third round of the World 2002 championship to be released, Croatia must enjoy its fourth participation in the final round of the European championship.
In front of 31,000 spectators at Maximir's stadium, Turkey should have almost a historic start.
Selcuk Ian hit only a bullet in the seventh minute from a distance, attacker Kazim could not even hang the reflected ball in the bra.
After this terrible second, Croatia took over, but still more and more control.
Even after the interruption of the Croatian branch, they didn't get it.
In addition to Mario Mandzukice from VfL Wolfsburg, who has been releasing tortmund Ivan Perisice since the 62th minute, the legionaries of the Spolk League were Daniel Prnjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt).
Trapatoni goes to the European Championship
In Dublin, Ireland celebrated its first European Championship in Germany since 1988.

Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) equalized for guests.
Ireland had been at the beginning of the pace, but had to wait until 23 minutes before Robbie Keane from Los Angeles had the first chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian defence prevent the possible lead barrier.
In 32 minutes, it was far away.
After Paul London's unsuccessful defense, Ward was on the scene and pushed the ball through a line to state 1:0.

Massacre at personal level
An emotionally strong new book by Peter Englund entitled Beauty and Grief: The Confidential History of the First World War (The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War) begins with such a long list of emerging characters as you close your head.
One advice on how to maintain yourself at the moment: Carefully remove this page and make a bookmark.
For you will be very familiar with all the people in Mr. Englund's novel story and this list will serve you as a navigation - as a Mayan - at a time when you will feel confused and lost in different situations, as well as men and women in the story.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also a new deputy at the Swedish Academy, which gives the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book we're talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite aptly, as "antihistoric work".
It contains several very well-known names, important contracts or famous battles, on the other hand, it almost lacks ambassadors, energy journalists and discussions on tactics and equipment.
It's not even a book about what happened, the author explains, rather, "the book about what it was." It's mainly about "feelings, perceptions, experiences and tastes".
"Grace and sorrow" combines war experiences of 20 more less fat men and women, on both sides of the barricade, from students and botanists to horoles, doctors, rescue drivers and officials.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others will become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go crazy or die.
Their lives smell like candles lit in churches - new ones are added to the network of fates while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund's book is different from the classic historical novels.
The idea is that the first world war was just a horrific burial battle on the West Front.
"Beautiful and sad" explores other places where war dramas took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book solve problems by falling on their bees nests, must spend Christmas in the shade of pyramids or face the presence of many tse-tse.
It's almost from the beginning, it's a very sensitive reading.
The war will swallow people's lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling gunfire.
When you start shooting at work in the distance and you're a woman who's at home with her children, will you run away or stay?
Who's actually getting closer?
Almost no one understands what's going on, even why the whole war was torn apart.
"Vakuum arising from lack of facts," Mr. Englund noted, "was filled with conjectures, thoughts, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and fams."
"The beauty and sorrow" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmrough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are all taken from biographies, letters and other material already published.
The descriptions of their lives can sound frightening and fascinating, but thanks to the involvement of the few moments and details are completely alive and credible.
Many of them talk about suffering and dealing with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says, "Refunds, all over the place."
"The replacement of coffee, the appearance of aluminium, the imitation of rubber, paper straps, wooden buttons."
She's still going on and describing the food replacements in Germany.
It refers to "mass made of liquefied rice cooked in wooded fat (and supplemented by falsified wood bone), tobacco from dried roots and dried potatoes, boots with wooden shells".
It mentions that there were "837 registered meat substitutes in the production of parks and 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and stamina.
One American finds in himself inner impulses to savageness and brutality, which says about war: "You will finally understand that this is a human nature. Not to sit in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, evening newspapers or a good book and pretend that this mask represents civilization and that behind that scratch I don't hide any barbaric in nitre."
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he is most likely to die soon and that no one will even notice it but to grieve.
"If a person finally makes peace with his sacrifice, he would at least wait for it to happen before the sights of the grateful audience," he writes.
Instead, he seems like a "defendant who secretly hangs him."
Further notes concern the departure of old Europe and the emergence of new threats.
"The conflict with the more economic competition and competition," writes Mr. Englund, "the war between factories."
He caught what he says "a new species of the coming century: a provocative and ideologically sworn mass murderer in a dress cut to the peace that carries out his bloodshed without rising from the table."
People behave totally unexpected, subjugation is in conflict with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes the soldiers who deliberately tried to catch a sexual illness from the prostitutes to avoid service on the front.
"The most serious example of this behavior was the trade with the gonococcal nest, which the soldiers bought and tortured in the hope that it would end in the hospital," he writes.
"The most confident ones have even thrust him into the eye, which has often blinded him to the end of his life."
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Gravese, Mr. Englund's prowl is fresh, but it is not obvious, which is very appropriate for his human theme.
In dozens of small outputs, it captures the way in which the war "demonstrated totally insurmountable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolutions, religious hatred".
People start asking why their leaders are forced to fight.
The best books on the first world war were mostly more than the complex narratives worked with signs, such as "First World War and Modern Memories" by Paul Fussell or novelized as "On the West Front of Peace" by Eric Marie Remarque.
Mr. Englund gives preference to an unconventional notion.
His book has the most confusing conclusions, which he has no period in popular scientific literature.
But I won't betray him to you.
But you'll look like the author just jumped out of the book, pulled a page out of the list of heroes out of your hand and burned it.
After the previous error this time for a minute precisely planned case
She was attended by hundreds of police officers, some of whom were used in street riots.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park should be almost empty at the time.
Nobody knew about the action except a few high-ranking officers.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence highlighted how many problems the police department had to face during the operation.
Cases from the last few weeks should not be repeated when, for example, the use of pepper sprays against demonstrators, which violated the rules of the department and, moreover, the sympathy of the public was shifted to the side of the squatters.
That is why a police operation aimed at cleaning the Zuccotti Park from demonstrators was launched after up to two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
The leading representatives were inspired by operations carried out in other cities.
Massive training for crisis behaviour took place in Randalls Island, which was a preparation for action in Zuccotti Park.
Leaders have reinforced so-called training to suppress anxiety - anti-terrorist measures involving the rapid movement of a large number of police officers - with a focus on the urban part of Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to move to the park came literally "at the last moment" someone said that the events were originally explained only as "practice".
"I know a few police officers who were also invited to this event, and certainly no one told them that they were going to Zuccotti Park," said a person who spoke only if he remained anonymous.
"The fact that he's going to Zuccotti Park, they only knew the highest position in the department."
One of the reasons for the secrecy was the lesson that had already been given to the city.
On 14 October, representatives of the city had to clean the park plan, but then they went down from the plan, because as soon as the demonstrators heard about it, they added them before the start of the operation into the park for the entire hundred.
Tuesday's actions were attended by policemen from various units, including raid groups from around the world - dozens of police officers who are usually used to strengthen the districts with higher levels of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day in the park he was coming and leaving a large number of people again, so one hour at night was the ideal time for the event to start.
"It was appropriate to do it at a time when it would be in the park as many people as possible," he said.
Before the units went out, they set up between the streets of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge bridge, trucks of emergency units with skylights and ampliances.
The light and the recorded message coming from the amplifications of many demonstrators scared.
When members of the ordering units entered the park in their blue windmills, many demonstrators packed their things and left.
Police claim that until 1:45 in the morning, she didn't reach the only state she wanted to give the demonstrators time to pack things up.
Other police teams have been watched as they gather on the edge of the park so that they can enter it if there is a need for an arrest.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
The chief spokesperson of the police department Paul J. Browne claimed that this was for their safety.
Many journalists, however, hold the view that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing her units in action, and some police officers were also rude to them.
Mr. Browne claimed that the television cars on Church Street leading along the western border of the park could film without problems.
The police went west and mixed up with a lot of personal confusion of protesting things, including bags and Igelite bags full of clothes, followed by teams from the Hygiene Department who immediately scratched everything that was left in the park.
Some demonstrators who refused to move were pulled out of the park. Documenting image materials appeared on the Internet a moment later.
The most vulnerable group of demonstrators flocked to the vicinity of the kitchen in their camp, which lay near the center of the park.
Some have created tartaras, and the police have begun their methodic arrest.
About ten people in the camp centre joined each other.
And two people tied themselves to the tree, Mr. Kelly said.
Members of the emergency services were called to intercept the locks.
By 3:30 p.m., there was no arrest in the park, Mr. Kelly announced.
The whole operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police said.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were detained in the park.
Most of the arrests took place because of "the organisation of extremities and the placing of resistance in arrest," he explained.
Joseph J. Esposito, chief of the police department, was the highest-ranking uniformed officer in the department.
The operation was also personally attended by Phil T. Pulaski, chief of detectives in the department.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "he didn't participate in the operation," Mr. Browne said.
The second group of police waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it was necessary to call her.
On Cortland Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south of the park, there were raids.
The police then developed a protective belt away from Zuccotti Park.
In one place, policemen were seen, many of whom were equipped with shields, as people continue to push beyond this border.
There were about 28 people on the north border.
The wildest events of the night took place south of the park.
About five o'clock in the morning was seen one demonstration south of Pine Street, as he jumped on the hood of the police car, and several others who dropped the air from the police van.
At one point, a piece of a puzzle flew out of the dock.
One police officer and one protestant were hospitalized at the end of the operation.
The committee's union of assistant workers will complain about the city's release
The committees representing hundreds of school assistants, who lost their jobs last month, are planning to complain about the city on Wednesday. They claim that the leave was not necessary and that it was discrimination, due to the undue impact on schools visited by poor students.
The Court of Justice is probably the last option remaining for the District Council 37 committees in their attempt to reverse the decision on release.
On 7 October, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parental coordinators and other staff members who were among the highest paid city employees lost their jobs.
The city's representatives categorically rejected this charge.
At the meeting of the City Council last month, Minister of Education Dennis M. Walcott said that discharge was part of the June budget.
One member of the board immediately questioned the fact that the budget did not specifically deal with the release of auxiliary workers.
Representatives of District Council 37 announced that they had already filled out the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education that they would be suing it. On Wednesday, they approved a press conference, where they formally announced the complaint to the Supreme Court of State in Manhattan.
The defendants will be Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education, while the complainant will be eight released workers, all of whom are African-American or Hispanic, as will most of the other assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesperson for the City's Legal Department, said that the city had not seen the complaint yet, and that is why she won't make any accusations.
According to a draft complaint that succeeded in obtaining the New York Times, the committees focused on the number of people released in poor parts of the city who wanted to support their allegations of unfair conduct.
They point out that while schools in the Staten Island part did not fail at all and in the Upper East Side only at least, in Brooklyn, in District 23 in Brownsville, 17 school assistants were lost and in District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx, even 46 assistants were released.
She recalls that at the School of Public School 36 in Harlem, five out of eight assistants lost their jobs, even though it is a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. The complaint says: "It is not a neighborhood full of language parents who can make money to compensate for the deficit in the budget."
The budget of the Public School 36 was reduced by 3.26 per cent this year and the school also lost money when the city changed the way the bonus finance was calculated for each registered poor student.
Committees, in addition, argue that the directors of secondary schools could be confused by the way in which the document approving the release of parental coordinators was written.
The document used the word "excess" to describe the action, thus cancelling the position, although this word is used much more frequently to describe the teacher's move from the school's payroll to the available employees' database whose salary is played by the central authority.
" Sixty-six parent coordinators have been released," says the complaint proposal, "and not just moved to the database in the position of available employees."
Mission is at the end, Congress is ready to accept the agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, it seems that the Republicans and Democrats at the Congress agree on something concerning the uprising in Libya.
Before that, however, the revolution had to succeed, for a long time the ruling dictator Muammar Kadddafí had to be arrested and killed and the participation of United States units ended.
On Tuesday, the Commission on International Relations of the Senate will decide on a statement supported by President John Kerry (Mass.) together with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which he should thank the Libyans for their successful establishment and the American units for their "statehood".
"With this statement, we want to assess the courage of the Libyans who began to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express support for their democratic efforts."
Those words may seem innocent, but no debate concerning Libya has been easy.
During the summer, lawmakers from both sides were constantly negotiating with the White House on the adoption of a series of declarations for approval or the rejection of the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented resolutions authorizing limited use of the US armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the House because of the differing views of both sides, so it had never been voted on in the Senate.
However, on the same day that this proposal was rejected in the House, the Chamber also rejected measures that would stop the financing of US operations in Libya.
The US mission in Libya literally read in the legislative cleanup - Congress criticised the way President Obama's mission is running, but his members obviously did not interfere enough to stop supporting him in his work.
The courage of the convention finally led to other events.
The rebels were killed by Tripoli in August, and on October 20, Kaddafi was killed.
The mission of NATO officially ended on October 31st.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The Commission on International Relations, in its statement, "gratifies the Libyans for their immeasurable courage and extraordinary courage that they have exercised in their efforts to free their people" and "glorifies men and women of the armed forces of the United States and their allies, who have engaged in an operation to protect the Libyan population, for their extraordinary stamina and professionalism."
The statement also states "the national interest of the United States in the successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya is confirmed."
Will the new proposal receive full support from the Commission for International Relations, or will the legislators be redeployed to two-half, as was the case when the June proposal was adopted?
Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), chief representative of the Republican Party, was appointed to the Commission.
Lugar's spokesman on Monday said he hasn't seen the final version of the new proposal yet.
This week there will be a vote on an addendum to the Constitution, which would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority for almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, promoted by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first addendum to the Constitution on the budget or other subject to be voted on by the whole House or the Senate.
The other legislators have, for the time being, not yet succeeded in suppressing their proposals until the vote itself.
Goodlatt's proposal is just one of 68 supplements to the constitution that were presented at the convention and touched on a wide range of topics.
Some of them were the same -- the same proposal presented to the House of Jehovah -- and some of them were only for minor exchanges.
Only 15 versions of the balanced budget supplement and another piece of paper that would like to "regulatory federal expenditure" can be found in the House.
Some of the proposals are identical, but their supporters - especially the Republicans who want to improve their reputation - can boast of their "authority".
The result of the regulation of the budget, which was approved in August, required a vote on the supplementary budget to be taken by the House and the Senate.
In March 58 senators voted in favour of an optional declaration in support of the creation of such an addendum.
In addition to the budget, several members also want to discuss the number of times the members of the Congress could serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of times that may be served by the President.
Deputy Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a range of supplements that would guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
The permanent proposal remains the addition banning the marriage of couples of the same sex and the addition banning the burning of the State flag.
Some legislators also want to allow the abolition of federal laws in the event of two thirds of the state being set up against them.
Although members of Congress seem to be very active in designing various supplements, they do not significantly deviate from the average compared to previous years.
At the 111th Congress, 77 additionals were offered, while at the 100th Congress there were 66.
Their activity is even pale in comparison with the beginning of the 20th century when, according to the statistics of the Senate libraries, members offered more than 150 supplements every two years.
However, they were not much more successful than today's politics.
The last addendum, which was added - 27th addendum - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Depressed, but not defeated," said Gifford in his first TV talk since the shooting
Ten months after she was hit by an immediate shooter at a public meeting with Tucson voters, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) discovered on Monday night on state television, sang along with a melody from the Broadway Show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that more than returning to Congress is worth healing.
Giffords appeared in the "20/20" series at the ABC News station with Diane Sawyer. It was seen that the windworks were still making trouble and needed help during the walk.
The whole show documented her difficult reconvalescence, which was necessary for the injury caused by a bullet that went through her head in front, penetrated her left half-brain, and came out of her head.
Three months ago, she suddenly returned to the House to participate in a triumphal vote on the debt ceiling.
In his first television interview from the ice shooting, during which six people were killed and 13 others were injured, Giffords laughed, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "hard".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, she said, "That's pretty good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hourly special part of the "20/20" series, which was broadcast in the evening of the release of this couple's new book, entitled "Gabby: Story of Courage and Hope".
The special was tracking the whole Gifford reconvalescence since the 8th January shooting.
On the videos that Kelly recorded during the first week, see Giffords in a hospital bed with his head shaved and long scars all over his forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can't do more than raise one or two fingers at the time.
A few months later, Giffords is caught sitting in a wheelchair and the therapist is teaching her how to perform simple activities.
Headache.
Oral spraying.
And then, her first word, "What."
During a few days, Giffords said another word -- "toast" when she needed changes in her breakfast.
The video sent by ABC station shows that the critical role for the recovery of Gifford's music: Congressman sings on them along with the melody therapist for the song "Girls Just Wanda Have Fun" from Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" from Tom Petty.
During the conversation with Gifford, who spends two hours a day on therapy, Sawyer discovered that from the day he was shot, he didn't remember anything.
Her husband said that Gifford had read the paper on the shooting by March 12th, when she first asked who was the six that was killed during the incident.
From the shooting is a suspect Jared Lee Loughner, who is detained in a prison in Missouri, where under the influence of violent drugs, he is awaiting trial.
"Many people died," said Gifford's Sawyer.
"Horrific, horrific, horrific."
Kelly Sawyer revealed that at one point his wife said during the reconvalescence, "I lost."
"So I told her right away, Gabby, you didn't lose," Kelly described.
"You just got the truck.
But you can do it, you can get together, and you can go back even stronger than ever."
Military units meet more with compassion than with respect
That event was a gala evening on Wall Street, which cost millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who don't have a roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about powerlessness, frustration and loss.
There were hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and sailors running around him.
A gloriously dressed man stood up and throbbed eagerly.
"Men and women serving in the army were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who managed the spring benefit.
In addition to this, Admiral Mike Mullen, who saw the role of military units in a somewhat different way, was also the chairman of the committee of chief of staff.
"They were all presented as poor people," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure that's what the organizers thought.
I know you do.
But what I saw wasn't respect.
So completely wrong impressions just illustrate the slight relationship between the army and often measured, sometimes glorifying the American public.
The army is certainly included in praise for its victims.
But these praise stands for something, the soldiers say.
The public is becoming more and more like a person in the uniform who feels sorry.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led units in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some can support us is to put us in the role of unhappy souls."
This topic is very sensitive to the military commanders who do not want to appear ungrateful or show themselves to the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger they had to face once returning from Vietnam was much worse.
As a result, most words of pity are uttered in silence and in private among war veterans.
When two retired Colonel Mark Cancian's sons returned from the fighting operations where they served as members of the Marine Corps, their father warned them that people outside the army would look from two angles at their service.
From the point of view of some, he will feel respect and admiration because they have defeated enemy rebels and visited exotic places.
In other words, it will spin its head if "no evil, violent veteran is covered under the surface," said Cancian, who participated in the fights in Iraq and after his return took a place in Washington in the government.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some people who were interviewing him were incredibly pointing out if he could cope with the stress of working in Washington as soon as he was back with the fight.
"When you talk about your service, you have to count on negative reactions," Cancian taught his sons.
The anxiety of the army partly stems from American greed for war.
The success of the battlefield only rarely results in recognition in a country that has only a small awareness of its own army and in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan finds only little of its own advantage.
"As a nation we no longer consider military heroism as usual in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno, who led US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, political and public recognition focuses mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are designated for the number of actions they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The army faces increasing pressure to take strong action against rape
This week, it will decide whether the trial of 28 women and men against the army will be initiated due to alleged inaction in the event of rape.
If not, they are prepared to file a complaint with hundreds of other proposers.
The first class of soldiers Elizabeth Lyman was reportedly raped by her army colleague for 25 years and was pregnant at the 11th week.
It happened in October 2008 and she went to the spouses at the Miramar airport in the north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend, she hit her male colleague with a 12 beer box.
He asked her if she could join her so they could have a drink in her room.
"In my head was a warning light," Lyman described.
But the native Texasan ignored her objections completely.
I thought, "No, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
She claims that only a few minutes after they entered her room, her husband walked over to her, threw her into bed and raped her.
This week, 18 November, Lyman and 27 other existing or former members of the army will be waiting for a verdict that could have a historical effect. This will be played in Arlington, Virginia, and will be about whether the charge against former Minister of Defence Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought to trial.
The indictment states that Gates and Rumsfeld failed in the fight against the proliferation of violence in the army, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
The charge was filed in February by Washington lawyer Susan Burke and the complainant had 17 members at the time. However, during the following months, their number grew to 28-25 women and three men, who all claimed to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the army and that the army had failed in investigating, punishing and any persecution for righteousness.
Burke claims he's going after the highest-ranking army commanders, because the problem is starting with them.
"The army is a directive system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent efforts to introduce measures against such acts?
Burke also claims that she has contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, many of which could be part of the other complaints filed in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than collecting all the charges in this case - she put all the eggs in one basket, as she says - she makes complaints in several different cases if pressure is not needed.
The Defence Ministry team is led by the United States State Representative Neil MacBride, who, together with his associates, has initiated a rejection of the case.
The judicial documents received by Newsweek are a detailed discussion of the defence strategy - in principle, it is that current or former soldiers cannot sue the army for injuries suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to the 1950 Supreme Court Regulation called Faires Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for the injuries suffered by soldiers in the active service.
"The alleged injuries concern the military services of the complainants," the document says.
The Ministry of Defence refused to speak on this matter.
However, things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially not allowed to serve in the fight, it is only about vocabulary: in modern wars it is only difficult to find a clear front line.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, women's troops played an even more significant role, especially in the area of communication with civil women in the war zone.
As a result, 150 female soldiers fell among these wars - two thirds of them directly in battle.
There's been time for modernization in the army, too, explains Burke.
She's not alone in her fight.
At Yale School of Law, visitors to the Veteran Seminar on Legal Services prepare a complaint at the four main military academy for the supposed development of an atmosphere that fosters hatred for women.
Regardless of the non-profit organisation of the American Vietnamese veterans, the case is based on a complaint against the army. This complaint focuses on the diagnosis of " personality violations", which was allegedly found in the victim of rape, to have the army shut down to their release - according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati belonging to a group of human rights fighters Service Women's Action Network, is a very common practice.
In December, her group had already submitted a motion for a complaint against a state organisation for the treatment of veterans, accused of discriminatory practices which should have occurred in processing requests for assistance from persons claiming to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
In Congress, nine separate proposals were presented by a group of senators and Members from both sides and proposed a series of corrective measures.
According to the Office for the Prevention and Resolution of Sexual Violence of the Ministry of Defence, 3,158 sexual attacks were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains largely unreported and according to the Pentagon’s own estimates, this figure corresponds to about 13.5% of the estimated number of 19,000 incidents that occurred in that year.
The report issued in March also includes the rate of criminal prosecution of suspects: in 2010, 20 per cent of the cases reported in the army - half against the civil justice system.
In the case of Deputy Burke, the plaintiffs describe the attacks only as the first of the entire series of traumas.
For example, the first-class army, Lyman, reported alleged military police rape not an hour after coming to him.
During the night, she said, she was asked to repeat details of her rape eleven times to various police, doctors and commanders.
She underwent all the tests necessary to identify the rape and in her bed was found the blood of an attacker - from the wound she had inflicted on him.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman completed the hearing before the court, during which she was asked questions as to whether she loved her friend on the day of the attack.
Six persons were summoned to testify to the reputation of the alleged offender, who was finally acquitted of his guilt.
"I remember the day the judgment was issued," Lyman says.
"I felt like I was giving birth right there - with a scream I ran out of the courthouse."
"They put me in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, "It wasn't his judgment.
Lymans were ordered to visit a military psychiatrist who had finally diagnosed a personality disorder that he described as unfit for service.
In January 2010, the army was released without honor and therefore without any claim to service.
Whether the case of Lyman and the other plaintiffs moves to another stage or not, it's a long run, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University of Law.
However, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to move into further stages of negotiation."
However, between them and the verdict is the said doctrine, which has been criticized since the first time the light of the world has seen.
I am alone a life-long critic of the Phares Doctrine doctrine.
The army is several decades behind, because their duties do not allow the same level of motivation and deterrence.
He adds, "The odds are tougher against them... but it's important for them to try."
Only when good people are willing to fight will change.
Unless decided in their favour in the hearing, Burkevoá, the complainant's lawyer, gathers hundreds of others who are prepared to file a complaint and starts working on other cases relating to this matter.
"Let's not stop the army from fighting on this issue where reform is not coming," he says.
Or until we die, according to what's coming.
Walls have eyes: How scientists examine you on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of legal extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the July killing riot after which 77 were killed in Norway, participated in his first public hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was certainly not alone in the cyberspace: during the preparation of the attack he spent a lot of time with his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting the legal group on social media sites.
After the tragedy this year, scientists want to learn more about these people.
How do you find them?
Easy - just go on Facebook.
"We realized that reaching them is not really so difficult," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by the British research team on European digital populism.
The content of personal information on Facebook is so comprehensive, says Bartlett, that scientists have enough to make easy use of advertising on the pages and, thanks to its absolute accuracy, they have identified a sought-after demographic group - something that marketing workers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team across Europe has found half a million fans of right-wing groups, focusing on them and sending them adverts. However, instead of calling them to the newly formed group or offering them some diet products, they were called upon to fill out the questionnaire, which raised questions about their level of education, their relationship with violence and optimism in view of their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to obtain results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different rights groups in 11 European countries - without having to leave the office at all.
"It's a completely new way of doing research," notes Bartlett.
Some of the results are not so surprising: on-line law-enforcement graduates are all young men who support the growing rate of immigration.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind the screen."
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists and political researchers use these pages to study everything, from health problems to social trends that hide state updates, contributions to the walls and press "I like" buttons.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each of them will provide on average three different data, which from this social network literally does "information supernova", which is behind the development of many new research. The number of academic works, whose name appears on Facebook, has risen against the status of almost 800% five years ago.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it allows them to study people without having to bother them somewhere on the street.
"It used to pay that if you wanted to conduct a survey among people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You should get to a party where you'd never be let go," says Bartlett.
"This is what Facebook is all about - just go straight to them."
Others argue that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid social and health problems.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren from the University of Wisconsin, a research team found that university students who had discussed their drinking outcomes on Facebook were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who were silent about it.
Moren proposes that the student's peers monitor the site and come with an offer of help to a student who publishes too much drunk status.
"The problem cannot be solved unless you can diagnose it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moren and Director of the Center for Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle.
"We've found a way to identify the children who are in danger that we shouldn't have a chance to find out."
Facebook constantly searches the data of its users.
The information team developed statistics on relationship status and Valentine's Day, electoral participation in 2010 and the satisfaction ratio of the nation (mainly using the information they had access to - Internet freedom defenders have long claimed that the site should have its information treasure access to research as well as others).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching whether they like it or not - an exchange for the possibility to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you need to provide your personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don't even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect data offline. However, online data is accessible to everyone.
"I don't think most users would even think scientists could look into their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study that he conducted using his students' public facebook walls.
"When it comes to them, they take it so that information is only between them and their friends."
Then it is also to consider the question of methodology.
Even in offline research there is no guarantee that the entity is absolutely honest.
There is no way to verify on Facebook how much information on the profile and contributions on the wall is true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two totally different things," Selwyn explains.
That is why Selwin, who has been researching new technologies for many years, believes that the pen and writer remain the best possible tool to be used in research.
"When you go out into the real world and talk to real people, it's something that can't be replaced," he says.
"Social research should be about society and social activities - and a hell of a lot of social activities are still being played off-line."
"Frozen and non-human": Anders Behring Breivik participates in his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who admitted to establishing two attacks during which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself as a "defense" fighter during his first public hearing in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and among the Norwegian Templar Knights," he declared before the court where 500 people gathered.
"I object to the court, because the mandate has been given to you by organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I admit to my actions, but I don't admit to them any guilt."
Judge Torkel Nesheim Breivika interrupted during this monologue because "he did not want to give Breivik an opportunity to use this hearing as a stage from which he could vote."
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who brought the prepared speech with him, to allow his relatives to address his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivika in custody for another 12 weeks, prohibited him any contact with the media for 4 minutes, and announced that the authorities would have full control over all his visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
The hearing was attended by about 30 relatives and survivors.
Some have come to the hope that they will be able to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he's held firmly under the castle.
Everyone participated to move the case to a quick closure.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," the NRK commentator said to one of the survivors.
"It wasn't pleasant, but I can tell myself that after seeing and hearing the suspect, I moved mentally a little further."
Breivik, in dark clothing and blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. On arrival and departure to the building without difficulty looking at the present journalists and surviving into the eyes.
Despite Breivik's bizarre idea that he's part of a bigger "resistance" movement, the judge found he's not crazy, and noted that there's no evidence that he's got a partner.
For someone, it can be a comfort that the June 22 attacks seem to be the work of the only extremist and not a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically reduce the sadness and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the whole nation.
"I'd like her to look like a creature, but it's not," said the relative of one of the victims.
"If I did, everything would be much simpler."
7 lessons from a lost conversation with Steve Jobs in a movie going to movies this week
As soon as Steve Jobs died on October 5, the views of the people who compared him to Henry Ford began to appear and chose him for his genius as the greatest modern inventor.
For the recently re-released Job's interview, which was missed for a special movie that is going to film this week, it will be for all fans of Apple that his creative mind perfectly understood the trade processes and workflows behind his products.
He was an amazing designer, a snowman and a self-employed member of the hippie movement, but also a pedantic organizer and a man, who every detail goes into the smallest detail - he believed that many entrepreneurs suffer "the idea that a really great idea is from 90% of their work... [but] between the excellent idea and the excellent result product is still a long way to get to work."
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on the TV show Triumf of Computer Fools, who discussed the emergence of personal computers. During the filming, a unique, more than an hour talk was played.
At that time it had been ten years since Jobes was forced to leave Apple, and had full hands working with his new computer company NeXT, and looked impatiently at how the wide public would accept the Internet.
The TV show finally used only a short part of the entire discussion of Cringely and the original copies of the interview betrayed that they had lost in transport.
Shortly after Job’s death, however, VHS copies were found in the director’s garage.
Just this material, slightly cut, forms the basis of the 68-minute Steve Jobs image: Lost interview, which is going to selected movies this Wednesday and Thursday.
To someone who has voiced his dissatisfaction with the provision of longer conversations here, Jobs is even surprised to learn that he can talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And it also turns out to be a very thoughtful man.
Four times during the conversation, there will be a longer pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, when it is to see how Jobes' answer perfectly thinks to be the most accurate and the most accurate.
There are also moments when Job’s perfectionism floats on the surface, when Cringelly’s questions act impatiently and move him to get to more important problems and topics faster.
The interview was recorded before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone and there are fearsome prophetic thoughts in it when Jobs evaluates what other companies are doing well and badly, offering their own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
One thing is to read Job's postmortem evaluation of his career, but at Job's, which we see here as an inspiring dream in the bloom of his genius, is something raw and inspiring.
He has his own vision here of how things could and should look.
It didn't take long, and after he said his thoughts, he also began to put them into practice.
A quick summary of the seven scenes from the Lost Interview, which is definitely worth noting:
How he learned to run the company:
"During the years of the company, I always asked myself: Why do you do this? And the answer was always the same: Well, that's how it's done."
No one knows why he's doing what he's doing, never thinking deep about business.
I found out.
Jobs continues by describing its efforts to simplify accounting in Apple.
He was completely confused by the way the costs were recorded - often started with the "standard costs", about their height he could only think of. At that time he decided to go his own way - he developed an automatic tool that ensured that the commercial costs could be determined in a moment.
As he did the vegetable on the papacy:
Jobs remembers the Blue Box, which he set up with Steve Wozniak - a device that enabled people to travel effectively to the telephone company and call anywhere in the world free of charge.
The device was already written in the past, but Job’s enthusiasm when the Blue Box describes it as a tool of power is literally contagious.
They will tell how the device was tested with Wozniak using the paid phone and during the call they were transferred from one AT&T network to another while using the largest number of satellites.
"Not only did we get halfway around the world this way, so when we screamed on the paid phone, it was just a minute later from the second door," Jobs laughs.
"We were young, and we found out that we could set up ourselves a thing that is capable of managing the infrastructure for billions of dollars around the world."
The two of us made a small thing that could control a lot of bigger things - it was an incredible experience, and I would never have raised Apple without it.
Jobs continues with the description of the joke that Wozniak and Wozniak almost reached the end. Through the Blue Box in the middle of the night, they called to the Vatican and asked whether they could talk to the pope, while they were best known for Henry Kissinger.
Gradually, they were summoned to speak to an American diplomat in the middle of the night, and just before they woke up to the phone and the pope himself, the two of them were confused and the listener lay down.
How he fell in love with technology (and called with Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12, and he was looking for spare parts to build his perimeter, he found a number on Bill Hewlett's phone list and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute interview, Jobes already had a secured summer brigade in Hewlett-Packard.
"It was the only company I knew at the time, and it shaped my view of what such a company really is and how to treat its employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited a company research lab in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
He was big as a suitcase, had a CRT monitor, and I fell in love with him right away.
As a teenager, I did high and high in HP, I leaned around the computer and started writing programs for him.
How does innovation come about:
In several jobs during the interview, he's talking about how he's inventing new products.
At the beginning of his career, when he sold a few plates with flat connections, one customer asked him to put the entire computer together for him.
He only had 30 paid days during which he had to invent, disassembly and add the finished equipment.
When he was later in Apple, he recalls the problems they faced when developing a computer mouse:
"I remember fighting pretty wildly... screaming at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] when I stopped having fun, I went out and found a designer."
About ninety days later, we were able to produce a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big a company is breathing:
Long before he led Apple's resurrection, Jobs had deliberately predicted that many industrial leaders would stumble in their vision and lose their market share.
"Let's say you're working with IBM or Xerox, so you're doing better copies or printers, so what else?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company can no longer be more successful.
At the moment, there is already plenty and marketing, so companies are taking over people who are concerned about this, while people who are concerned about their own products are being pushed out of the decision-making process.
The technological genius, which has led society to its unsurpassable position, is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - handicrafts and technical knowledge are necessary.
That's exactly what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could literally own the entire computer industry.
She could have been ten times bigger than she is, she could have been a Microsoft in the '90s...
Instead of winning, however, they won the losing.
How does innovation take as an art form:
"There's still a long way and a lot of work between a great idea and a great result product... and as that great idea develops, it's changing and growing."
You'll learn a lot about him during that time.
You have to join the whole series of compromises - certain things simply do not make electrons, glass, robots or factories.
You must keep 5,000 things in mind - different concepts - and put them together...
Finally, it depends on the taste - you try to think about the best things that mankind has ever created, and in a way you try to avoid what you do.
Picasso said good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been ashamed to break the best ideas.
Macintosh was so wonderful and successful because the people who worked in it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians and the best computer experts in the world at the same time.
Without computers and new technologies, they would be able to do amazing things in completely different sectors.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with opponents of the Health Care Act at the time of their trial
On the day that the Supreme Court sat at the closed doors to discuss a politically controversial question whether to accept an objection against President Obama's Health Care Act, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were participating in a celebrated dinner sponsored by the legal firm that will take part in the proceedings before the court.
The event took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the proposals.
One of the cases before us was the prosecution brought by 26 states questioning the radical reprocessing of health care, which Congress approved last year - a law that mobilized conservative activists worldwide.
In March, however, a 5.5-hour debate is expected, which will further distort the presidential elections, which are planned for 2012 and will be in full swing at the time of the decision.
The lawyer who stands before the court, who will try to challenge the law, will be most likely Paul Clement, who served as the United States Attorney General for the George W. Bush government.
Clement's legal firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinners of the Federalist Society, which has been defending conservative legal principles for many years.
Another company that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, is represented by one of the trade associations of law doubting, the so-called National Federation of Independent Enterprises.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which they are in the process of making a huge financial contribution.
Dinner took place at a Washington hotel several hours after the trial on the subject of the case.
It was attended by, among others, Mitch McConnell, the highest representative of the Republicans in the Senate, and confirmed opposition to the Health Care Act.
And the host's introduction?
It's nothing new: These two judges have been participating in the Federalist Society's action group for years.
And it certainly isn't about anything that would be contrary to the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempted from compliance with the principles of conduct that are subject to lower federal judges.
However, if it were not for this, their behaviour would certainly fall under principle C4, which says that "the judge may participate in actions which are directly related and other organisations for the purpose of obtaining financial resources, but the judge may not be a speaker, an honest guest, nor be included in the programme of action."
However, the relationship between Scalia and Thomas between the two law firms acting in the case, as well as companies with a huge financial interest in this case, was rich enough to alert activists calling for ethics in the government.
"This shocking violation of ethics and cowardice towards the code of conduct is contrary to the assertion of several judges that the highest court is acting in accordance with the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause.
"The judges drank and had dinner for social benefits together with legal representatives waiting for their case to be discussed before the court."
Their presence and assistance in obtaining funds through this action undermines the feet of all claims of incarceration, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little understanding to their critics and showed them that, without problems, they also combine their judicial duties with the actions of groups such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas Ginni's wife is a highly conservative activist.
In addition, conservatives suggest that the ethical problem is mainly with Judge Elena Kagan and not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as a general prosecutor for the governments of President Obama when the first objections to the law appeared before the court.
Kagan's critics press on her to refuse to participate in the case, and they claim that she was fighting for the law at that time as much as she could now be uninterested.
Kagan didn't mean she was going to resign.
Boeing received a record order for 18 billion US aircraft
Aerolinks Emirates order 50 two-wheel Boeing 777 aircraft with the possibility to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner flights to Aman Air, for which it charges more than USD 1 billion.
When a company gets an order for 50 pieces of its products, most of them have no reason to celebrate.
However, if the company is the manufacturer of Boeing Co. and the price of these 50 aircraft totals USD 18 billion, it is something else.
The same important report is also where Boeing received the order: Middle East, expanding the golden pot for future aircraft orders.
According to the forecast issued on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its biggest order on the weekend in history with respect to dollar values for commercial aircraft - 50 two-way Boeings 777.
Sentence order came from the Emirates Airlines in Dubai.
Boeing’s 2011 Dubai Air Show announced that airlines have the possibility to buy another 20 aircraft, thus saving the total value of the contract to USD 26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air airlines ordered six Boeing 787-8 machines, sometimes also known as Dreamliner, which boasts significantly better fuel consumption and passenger equipment.
The total price of these six planes exceeds USD 1 billion.
"This is an excellent report for the entire Boeing company," said Neal Dihora, an analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these specific customers is very high."
Many of the airlines in the Middle East belong to the darknessier nations of heavy oil.
This means that not only do they have money to pay for aircraft, but they have an increase in the price of propulsion materials - most of which are damaging airlines, because it is one of its biggest costs - it is not so decisive because the country itself makes a profit at higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders due to fuel price increases, Dihora says.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The Airbus SAS contract, which was intended to attempt to disrupt Boeing’s dominant position with its A350 transport model, strengthens Boeing’s leading position on the market with a large-scale aircraft.
Boeing’s victory comes four months after Airbus’ representatives announced that the first flight of its largest A350 aircraft would be removed, which is the direct competitor of 777-300ER.
It was because customers demanded a greater use of aircraft and flight, so the manufacturer took time to add more power to the engine.
Boeing Co's share price rose by 1.5% to 67.94 USD.
The Mexican president's sister was allegedly defeated in the Michoacán elections
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Faust Valleyon of PRI, was helped by drug dealers in the lobby behind the governor's chair.
It seems that Sister Felipe Calderona, in the violent state elections, lost the governor's position in Michoacán. On Monday, she declared that one of her opponents had helped drug dealers to win.
Preliminary results contributed to the leadership in the government elections of the western state of Faust Valley by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The actions of members of organised crime in the entire electoral process and especially in the course of yesterday's elections are alarming not only for Michoacán, but for our entire country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a discussion on the Sunday after Sunday's elections.
"They threatened our candidates, the members of the public opinion group... they were having the polls, they were building road raids... and they were letting people vote on the PRI order.
The PRI party ruled in Mexico for seven decades until 2000 when the presidency was lost.
However, planning a quick return to power and victory in the elections in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
PRI hopes to win in July in the presidential elections.
It seems that Valle has defeated Calderon, who led the election the day before, just very tight.
Calderon, the candidate for the Conservative side of his brother National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Valjeon as a winner.
Third, Silvano Aureolis, the candidate for the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, has been held by the government. For the broken and poorly persecuted party, before the 2012 presidential elections, is a very unfortunate loss.
Aureoles also refused to accept preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the state-owned capital of Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug dealers and offers other candidates for recognition of the results.
Michoacán has long been controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
This is the native state of President Calderon, and it was in Michoacán that in December 2006 the war against repurchasers began.
The violence, however, continued.
The mayor of the PAN, the successor of Luisa Marie Calderon, was murdered just a week before the elections, and many of the candidates for the elections were cast out of fear.
However, whether the results of the elections in Michoacán look for the PRI side or not, winning the side will help to get a new impulse.
The expected representative of PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Pena Nieto, from Wahington Valley, congratulated and said, "I think this victory might be very encouraging in view of the coming year."
ADB calls on Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to be prepared to help save the eurozone from its serious debt crisis, otherwise a global decline in the world economy, which would also have a negative impact on economic growth in Asia.
Rajat Nag, Director General of the ADB Bank, based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world must "do everything in their power" to help quickly recover the currency block through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the States of the Bric Group [Brazil, Russia, India, China] were following all European challenges "too uninterrupted" and said that Asian financial assistance in combination with European leadership and funds would help to bring about the long-term deterioration of the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is appropriate," he told the Financial Times during a discussion at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia may be protected to a certain extent, but definitely not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it."
The European Monetary Association has been experiencing a severe debt crisis for several months.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs have risen dangerously and the Italian and Greek governments have retreated.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised concerns that the global economy could be rescinded into recession, and calls began to emerge to unite and help the eurozone find solutions to the emerging front economies.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian support would be directed through the IMF, but noted that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of loans from the European Union Financial Assistance Fund, the European Financial Stability Institute - would provide the Asian partners of European countries with greater negotiating opportunities.
Anand Sharma, Indian Minister of Trade, said that "India will do what it can," to help the Eurozone, because its own economy now suffers from a decrease in exports and the outflow of foreign capital.
"No one wants the Eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We face a difficult task and must maintain a high rate of growth."
"It's not an alternative, it's an absolute fact, because otherwise we could find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies, such as those indica­tions, have nothing to do with European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashtosh Varshney, professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to explain aid for Europe to 1.2 billion Indians when 800 million of them live from $2 or less per day.
"One could find out that the Greeks go to retirement in their 50s and enjoy vacations on the beaches, which would probably be hard to explain," he noted.
Lee Howell, Director-General of the World Economic Forum, likewise questioned why Indian resources should be used to maintain well-paid employment for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and lost sectors, such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the eurozone crisis is threatening with a "dangerous domino effect".
The Bank's forecast to reach 7.5% of economic growth in Asia between 2011 and 2012, is now facing the "risk of decline" due to the European threat.
He stated that vulnerable developing markets had to create "unforeseen spending plans" to protect them from the decline and significant flow of capital from their economies.
Warning from the Pentagon about possible defensive cuts
On Monday, the Minister of Defence Leon Pannett put his hand in Congress when he warned that tearing automatic cuts in the budget could endanger national security and cause a financial chain reaction beginning in the Pentagon and continuing across the battlefield in Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will have to reduce the budget by $450 billion over the next ten years, but now it is afraid to reduce by another $600 billion if Congress is unable to conclude an expenditure agreement.
"The effects of these cuts would be destructive for the entire resort," Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that Congress' failure to reach the budget agreement and hence the so-called build-up would result in 23% drop-outs and many new projects being stopped.
"Because of such a huge reduction, which is used in this disproportionate way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or ship projects - you cannot buy only three quarters of the building or ship. Furthermore, there could be serious damage to other modernisation efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We will also have to separate many of our civilian employees, and since the reduction is going to take place so quickly, we will also have to send almost certainly civilians on forced leave to be able to meet the target requirements."
"These changes can be exasperated by the faith of those who take care of our army and seriously damage its readiness."
Finally, the scars will touch the battle units, Panetta announced.
"Although the accounts for financing possible war operations in the overseas world are not directly affected, the more recent operations will be adversely affected by major changes in the other budgets," Panetta warned.
"There will also be cuts in contractual staff, which will result from the delay of agreed contracts to support the war effort of our people."
"The situation of paid employees will be reduced, from which late payments will also be made to suppliers and subsequent violations of legal and political support."
Both Senators of Pannett wrote ten days ago and asked him for details of the possible effects on automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of the stay at the Ministry of Defence could cause a rapid deterioration of the view of the United States as a world military power."
"We are strictly against this tough measure," the senators announced in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Pannett's letter.
"It's not a conclusion that we could live with, and we definitely don't want to sign it."
"The planned strikes are a threat to national security of the United States, which we should not allow."
"It will only be seen whether Pannett's letter and fresh warning will increase the pressure on Congress to approve the budget and increase the votes calling for the release of the Pentagon from the list of restricted areas.
In recent discussions on possible cuts, the panetta was as open as possible, although he himself moved to his high position in the Pentagon with long years of experience in approving the budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was going to go into a tough fight.
At a press conference held a minute a week, the Minister of Defence pointed out a brief picture of what his resort can expect - a shell of an army inside which will be missing the core.
"It'll be like a ship without sailors."
"He'll be like a brigade without a munitions."
"It'll be like a flight without trained pilots."
"It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of soldiers, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to complete the mission," Panetta said at the beginning of the Pentagon speech.
"He will be like a unit without morals, unprepared and unable to equalize the possible enemy."
"As a result, he will welcome the aggression..."
In the Annex to McCain and Graham's Panel, the letter specifies how the reduction will result in a "significant operational risk: a late response to the crisis, conflicts and disasters; a significant limitation of the possibility of landings and landings around the world; a foreseeable unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
Furthermore, the Panel added that some of the largest defence projects could be expected to end, including those that have already been tested, even those that are only in early stages of planning.
For example, the F35 aircraft project, planned by a new bomber, a new generation of ballistic submarines, a new coastal battleship and a new ground combat vehicle, was designed to replace the army and the seabed with humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of F35 aircraft would save $80 billion over the next ten years, but its supporters claim that it is another necessary step in improving the army that is needed to deal with potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to Recognize the Lie
The summer view of recent news headlines suggests how serious and widespread lies and deception are in everyday life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, has a full hand job accusing him of sexually harassing several women - both sides claim that the other lies.
Managers at the University of Penn State were accused of false testimony when they tried to hide the records of a retired football coach sexually assaulting a boy.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy arrived, as US President Barrac Obama said with the microphone released, the Israeli President of the government of Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
The lie has been able to destroy all careers and enshrine the stability of many countries.
The New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool out of himself when he published information that was immediately distorted by unmistakable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of using the funding from his campaign to try to hide his non-marriage relationship.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that shot around Bill Clinton when he lied during the second period in his sexual relationship with Monica Levinski.
It's just stories about cheating at school and at the university all over the place.
There are cases where teachers themselves give their students test answers only to make them look good in their own judgements.
Mentors who should teach vices send a message that lies and deception are acceptable.
How many deceptions do we meet?
Studies show that you are in between 10 and 200 cases in one day.
Suppose a lot of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that during the first ten minutes of the first meeting in life, foreigners had lied three times.
Lying, or "lying," is a necessary skill that everyone should gain, whether for personal or work reasons.
However, it is not a social game that would be similar, say, Sharad, when a person will say, "I have you." The identification of deception is a serious science sector working with scientific data collected during the last six decades at prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most old myths about lies have been distorted.
Liars look in your eyes.
It's not like they're shaking, cocktails, reds, or wet.
However, do not export yourself from the fact that it is kind of difficult to watch and discover lies.
A trained liar identifier can reveal the truth from a substantial construction, minor facial expressions, the way to create questions and their timing.
I spent a few years collecting scientific knowledge from a vast and developing lying industry, and it is clear that the discovery of deception is a modern skill that can be easily learned and can help you very much in today’s difficult world - especially if your duties include hiring, arranging interviews, negotiating or conducting people.
Good liars can read well in others, let them pour themselves into caution, direct their emotions and intuitively realize how the other party accepts them.
We know from the research that extroverts lie more often than introverts that men utter more "self-centered" lies, while women say more lies "to others" - most of them to protect some feelings - that women lie less often to their partners than free people (but most people say lies are "immortal").
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.
It's called "the initial observation."
He'll be able to find out later what to compare with.
Note the attitude of the subject's body, his smile, his work with the voice.
You should know if someone is always tying his legs so that you don't unfairly accuse him of lying just because in the middle of the meeting, he's starting to thrash his legs.
Then try to determine the lines of false verbal and nonverbal behavior.
However, take it only as warning signals, not as evidence of a lie.
People who lie can stop moving the upper half of the body when they try to remember their dream story, the tip of their boots can turn to the door, push to the east, significantly change the body's attitude or give up the "relieve after the conversation" - excessive exhausting breath and change the position when it is difficult to answer.
People conducting interviews often issue a false signal that there is an interview at the end, just to see how the wave will look after it's over.
Take the subject's language as well.
Famous is the story of how Scott Peterson once crossed the line and used the last time he claimed his murdered wife was alive, which scattered the entire state search for her body.
Misleading entities can also say in measure: "I had no sexual relationship with that lady... Miss Levinska" or the difficult question is repeated.
The most common verbs are just very inconspicuous.
Someone can use a lot of "smoothing language" when answering the difficult question, "Well... to tell the truth... from what I know... according to my best knowledge."
In such a response, we do not know too much about the facts, and often this is another warning signal.
There is no magic that could reveal every lie, but it is possible to acquire the skills by which lies can be made.
By means of these skills, a person will have a greater chance of not finding a liar and a cheater in his personal and work.
The controversial plan for the construction of an oil pipeline will be redirected after the threat of delay of approval by the US Government
A few days after Obama's government threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - which has honored the committees but calmed environmentalists - the construction company announced that it is willing to redirect the project to make things move again.
TransCanada announced on Monday evening that it is moving the planned route from the ecologically sensitive area of Sandhills in Nebraska, and is convinced that the project will be approved.
This decision was notified by the company at a press conference in the seat of the Nebraska government.
TransCanada column Alex Pourbax argues that the company is convinced that the construction of the pipeline will eventually be approved, even though it will lead a different route.
This notice came after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated last week that it postponed the decision on the federal project authorisation, from which it would not carry out studies of possible replacement routes, which could not be affected in the Sandhills area of Nebraska and in the Ogalla watershed, a large underground reservoir.
"This is really moving forward," said Republican representative Lee Terry from Nebraska for Fox News.
The new ecological assessment commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would probably withdraw any decision until 2013, i.e. the year following the elections next year, but the authorities refuse to play any political role in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a request from the foreign ministry and expressed his support.
1,700 miles of long pipeline will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From the province of Albert to the refinery in Texas, it will flow 700,000 barrels of oil daily.
This way, six states will have to be breached.
This project hates environmentalists completely, but it is loved by workmates who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will appear when working on the pipeline.
However, the legislators in Nebraska set up and considered the introduction of laws that would force the company not to interfere with the Sand Hills region and the water supply of Ogallal, the main source of drinking water and moisture.
The current environmental impact study commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project would have only a small negative environmental impact, but a source from the energy industry said that the department's general inspector ordered a new review of the whole process of the initial study and focused mainly on two issues.
It was once that the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a consultant to Hillary Clinton in 2008, did not present a conflict of interest in the program.
Then, whether the company that was hired to conduct the original study was not chosen inappropriately because it had connections to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of having a battalion for her.
The New York family claims that the singer Patti LaBelle suddenly broke into the vestibule of their Manhattan home and frightened their daughter so that she gave up her fear.
The eight-month-old Genevieve Monk was so terrified that she suffered "changes in personality, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," claims her family in a lawsuit filed before the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
10 November last year, visual technician Kevin Monk, his wife Rosaanna, a teacher at school, and Genevieve were planning a family trip.
When Kevin Monk parked the car, Roseanna Monkova met down into the vestibule of their house in the Riverside Boulevard and took Genevieve with her.
Rosaanna Monková said she stopped at the door for a while and just put her baby down.
"Someone came up behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said "yes," and I went to pick her up."
LaBelle punished the pregnant woman suddenly.
"In an aggressive tone she said, "You shouldn't put your daughter at the door," said Rosana Monkova.
"I said to her, "I don't care about your opinion."
She got angry and started talking out loud, screaming out the simplest expressions...
She had a bottle of water and started waiting for me.
They say Genevieve got hysterical arrest.
"I said to the woman, "Look what you did to my daughter."
LaBelle to her mother - who was still in charge of Genevieve - threw her away and had to stop her when she was escorted to the waiting car, said Rosana Monková.
In the meantime, the daughter cried so much when she came back, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter asking LaBelle to apologize, but they did not get any answers.
Lawyer and vocalist LaBelle singers don't answer our phone calls to make a point of saying the whole case.
The complaint requires closer unexplained compensation, but the family legal representative, Sam Davis, said that the case was taken free of charge and that the family plans to spend all the money they have spent on charity with children with cancer.
"The aim is to force Patti LaBelle to accept responsibility for her actions," Davis said.
"This behavior is totally unacceptable, especially if it is intended against a school teacher holding in the arms of an 18-month-old."
The climate has derailed the economy
During the first year of the government of Maria López Valdez increased unemployment and insecurity in Sinaloa, decreased foreign investment and with them the economy
The year 2011 will be recorded in the economic history of Sinaloa. This is the first year of the government of Maria López Valdez, which itself is called the government of change. This government has brought with it great expectations, in terms of economic progress, but because of the adverse climatic conditions at the beginning of the year, no growth has been recorded and even the main indicators of economic development have been reduced.
Low February temperatures have caused millions of losses in agriculture, limited the potential for growth in the state economy, are aware of the decrease in economic activity by 3.6% in the first half of this year, and there has been a historical decline by 31.16% in agriculture, which has disrupted the dynamics of other economic sectors.
According to a report on the damage caused by the Mexican Rural Sustainable Development Council, damage was recorded at 582,835 hectares of cultivated land, of which 78.03% were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07% were found to be partial damage.
The decline in economic activity until November has led to a steady increase in unemployment in the state. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, unemployment rate in the state has increased during the first three quarters of the year. From January to March, 55,053 people in Sinaloa were unemployed, representing the unemployment rate of 4,53% of the working population. In the second quarter, unemployment rose to 5,28%, and between July and August, the average unemployment continued to grow and reached 6,19%, representing approximately 74,000 unemployed.
Less liquidity
According to Gerard López Cervantese, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly, based on the steps taken at the level of public policy.
"We are witnesses of increasing unemployment, which is linked to various factors. Among them are, among other things, the loss of liquidity on the market due to the limitation of resources resulting from legislation approved by the Congress in relation to the fight against money laundering. For people who illegally use dollars, it is not easy to make them, invest them or use them for something," he stressed.
Suspension of migration
López Cervantes stated that there is also a demographic factor to increase unemployment.
"The number of people leaving for work abroad, in the United States, has decreased, however, for reasons of the inability to enter, and also because even though these people are getting abroad, it is difficult for them to get a job.
Untrusted
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is also worsening due to the growing uncertainty prevailing in the field of working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the state's employees are working without reducing social security administration.
Other features of the labour market, such as low wages, are added to unemployment and insecurity. In this administrative area, the lowest wages are from all over the country, as indicated by the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5,352 pesetas by September, deeply below the national average of 7,375 pesetas.
Abbreviation of foreign direct investment
Along with the decline in economic activity and growth in unemployment, the most significant decrease in foreign direct investment over the past 10 years has been recorded in 2011. According to the Ministry of Finance, direct foreign investment of $630,697 has been achieved from January to June, representing a decrease of 87.74% compared to $5,143,312 for the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the State Government's Ministry of Economic Development is making investments of 17 280 million pesos a year.
Dluh
In relation to the economic downturn scenario, the government requested in July a state Congress to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos. It would be intended to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas with a view to revitalising the economy. The local Congress approved a loan of 2 600 million pesos. In November, no debt benefits were recorded, and that was in no sector of the state economy.
Reaction
According to representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government of Maria López Valdès pointed out the lack of government management.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chambers of the Transformation Industry, stated that in 2011 there was a lack of reconciliation between the individual sectors, including the state's own government.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa has been truly inconceivable during this year. We need to work hard to get the land we lost this year. In 2012 we need to double our efforts, the lack of harmonisation of efforts by all of us, and in particular the proper and synchronized functioning of this new government. Let's hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Deficit economy
Loredo López stated that the events as freezes at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and limited its development and growth.
"A weak economic movement has been caused by a number of events, including frosts. One of the main consequences has been slowing down the economy, which has not been remembered fast enough to generate momentum again, which would enable it to achieve an acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services. Therefore, at the end of the year we felt deeply under expected forecasts," he said.
Redefinition of dispatch
According to Theodore Salazar Uriarte, President of the Employer Confederation of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, it is necessary to push the state into more dynamic productive activities.
"In general we note that it is working. We believe that a long-term plan should be drawn up to redefine the objectives and economic direction of the state, because it is important to mobilise all the potential of material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
Work that is ahead of us
President Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future, which would better govern the government's efforts.
"I would generally say that the government has been trying to achieve good results in various areas, some progress has been made in the area of economic development, but it is important to make a long-term plan," he said.
He stated that the current administration had shown progress with regard to public policy management.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the government is trying to be polite. I can say that there is work done here and I think the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us," he said.
Sentenced for 8 kg marijuana
The resident Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days of punishment for holding eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic informed that the convicted dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted of a criminal offence of endangering health, specifically for holding marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by the Mexican army on 7 June 2010 at the Cipriano Valdez street, opposite the 80th station in El Castillo, Navolato.
Dealer drove in a type of pick up white color delivery. In a car in a pouch he had a black bag and a small bat. Soldiers found 8 kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured man has remained available to the Judge of the Second Division and the proceedings remain internal within the framework of the Centre for the Enforcement of Offences.
Contributions to projects
Social projects, which are part of programs such as Habitat, saving public places and 3x1 for migrants, face the danger that they will not be affected by the end or that they will be very late due to the lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The Director of Urban Social Development has stated that if construction work has so far gone ahead, it is now threatening that the state government will not be able to provide the relevant supplies that require more than 11 million pesos for three programmes.
He stated that the total investment in these three programmes is almost 50 million pesos. The state accounts for 25%. To date, only the Federation and the city added to the work.
"They're supposed to secure nearly 12 million and although the year is about to end, we've got nothing at all, and even though we were supposed to get a piece in July," he said. "In order not to waste time, we started projects and continue very well, but we lack money."
He stated that last year, for the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the state failed to meet the relevant supplies, so at the beginning of the new period he had to ask the city to borrow more than 7 million loans from the government.
"We already had a certain thing in the past six hundred years, because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programmes went on. To get to the programmes mentioned this year, we had to get funds that would cover what did not finish the state," he explained.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment from the state representatives regarding the transfer of these resources, he stated that the request was sent to Armand Villarreal, the secretary for administration and finance to speed up the management and the corresponding percentage reached as soon as possible.
"They were supposed to give us 12 million, and although the year is coming to an end, we haven't even got a weight."
The Court approves the "end of analogous transmission" in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of analog signals digitally is one of the most important changes the world has ever experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court of State (SCJN) rejected the constitutional appeal brought by the Senate and the Ambassador against the presidential decree, which wanted to speed up the so-called "proposal of analog signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021.
A minority of the four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his authority when he issued a decree stating the individual steps leading to the transition to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the appeal lodged by the Senate was rejected because a qualified majority of eight votes were not obtained in order to enable the court to express its constitutionality or non-constitution of the said decree, which remains valid.
The draft judgment drawn up by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Olgo Sánchez Cordero proposes the possibility of declaring a decree unconstitutional because the regulation of all radio and television issues is a matter which is, under law, replaced by the Federal Commission for Telecommunications (Cofetel).
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument both the Senate and the Ambassador's camera supported the constitutional dispute in an effort to combat the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero adopted the requirements and suspended the application of the decree and all the actions described in it leading to the transition to digitisation.
The meeting of ministers also decided to reject the complaint submitted by the Ambassador without entering into a debate on a proposal which also concerns Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the Federal Executive could not structure through general standards measures to prepare for public administration.
"I don't think that even if she did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory authority," and it reminded me that planning public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector belongs to the federal executive, who has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
The replacement of analog signals digitally is one of the biggest changes that the world has experienced in recent years. It is related to better use of radioelectric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
It is believed that to remove the change would mean to remove the benefit from the digitisation that requires a decision on matters of public interest. Digitalization does not only have a technical dimension, but "is also concerned with economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he stressed, these questions "require the operation of the entire system, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the state. It includes a whole range of competences that the Constitution entrusts to the government of the state".
He recalled that a number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to the digital system and had done so through their governments, even though highly specialized technical authorities were available.
He stated that it is not possible for the government to bring an inconsistency decree into the administrative area of compliance with legislation prepared to a certain extent by the Congress.
In Michoacán they analyze the possibility of counting "voice by voice"
According to the prep published, the difference between the first and second seats in the governor's elections is not an integer of 27 per cent. So far, the votes of 879 of the 6074 electoral districts have not been counted.
The possibility of counting "voice by vote" appeared in this year's elections in Michoacán, where according to the data published by the Pre-election Results Programme (PREP) there is a difference between the first and second seats in the governor's elections of 27 per cent, and this has not yet been counted in 879 of the total of 6074 electoral districts.
In this context, the President of the General Council of the Instituto Miquelon (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral authority approved a number of measures that should harmonise local standards with federal electoral reform.
As will yet be recalled, Michoacán has not officially confirmed its political constitution or its State Electoral Code or the Electoral Law. The State Congress has approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force in this election period, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel has recalled their publication within the prescribed time limit in the Official Journal Act with some objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of State (SCJN) resolved a constitutional dispute initiated by local legislative power and declared the head of state in the constitutional reform "inappropriate and illegal", because it has no right to "approve or veto".
On the question of the possibility of counting "voice by voice" María de los Ángeles Llanderal replied that the approval of the relevant measures by the General Council of the IEM would enable the local electoral authority to carry out partial and total counting.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, one or more electoral packages, will be possible under the following conditions: election results do not agree; there is no record of counting and calculation in the relevant policy or there is no President available; or if there are errors and obvious violations of the electoral results.
In addition, the overall recalculation of votes in all polling stations will be possible if there is an indication that the difference between the potential winner of the election and the candidate in the second place is less than or equal to one percentage point; whenever an express request from the representative of the party and/or the coalition proposed by the candidate in the second place is made at the beginning of the meeting.
The overall recalculation of votes will also be possible if, after proper counting, it is found that the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, and also whenever there is an express request from the political party whose candidate has ended in the second place. In such a case, the electoral packages in which partial counting has been carried out will be cut.
It should be mentioned that in such a situation there are elections in Morelia, where according to the PREP there is a difference between the first and the second places of the non-total 0.16%, although 129 of the total 923 electoral districts have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered in the Fire Mountain, confirmed by the family.
The rest of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés was transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown. During Monday, the ceremony and the back-up mass will take place.
According to the family, it was the Colonel's last wish that his ashes be scattered in the mountain of the Fire.
After receiving the highest honors in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuil on board the plane of the Mexican Air Force. The family and the closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
In the afternoon of the Colonel's ashes arrived at the chapel in the Nazario Ortiz Garza class, where family and friends also came.
At 5:30 p.m. there was a separation at the Institute of Technology in Saltillo, which was organized by his former high school staff and members of the American football team, who Felipe Bacio was also a member at the time of graduation.
"He wanted to go back to Saltilla and his wish was that his ashes were scattered in the mountain of the Fire. That's what he always told his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, a sister of the pilot.
According to her, the colonel fulfilled all his wishes, was at the top of his life, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young and went to college in Colegio del Aire in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some did not believe it because they said he was even driving a truck, yet he always went after his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "he barely came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him as when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
A young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopan to promote his uncle, so he is convinced that he died when he was his favorite thing in life: flying.
They gave him the last goodbye.
With Felipe Bacio Cortés, deputy commander of the Mexican Air Force, we were relieved of all the ways that Governor Jorge Torres López, citizens and the government of the state, the Mexican army through the six military zones, the Mexican Air Force itself, leading representatives and students of the University of Technology in Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and where he emerged in both study and sport.
Bacio Cortés died in the past days after the helicopter that was driving. There was also on board a secretary of the government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all the officials of this state.
At 18:05, the remains of the Saltillen relative Bacio Cortés (scattered) arrived to be handed over through the funeral service to the Mexican air force led by Major Jaime Martinez to the space where his family, his daughter Amanda, and Cristina's wife, mother, nephews and other relatives, students and teachers met.
Three dead bodies have been found on Cadereyta NL
Several hours before the arrival of the military representatives, they represented 11 persons detained in this area for crimes related to organised crime.
The bodies of three men killed in various parts of the body and head were found on the abandoned ship of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo Leon.
There were 1.5 kilometres of Cadereyt's road to Santiago, at the level of the area known as El Castillo.
People who moved in these places noticed that a chat room with a brewery-coffee tray had been open from time to time.
When they looked inside, about three feet [3 m] away, they noticed the corpse of three people, so they immediately alerted the competent authorities.
One of the people was wearing a yellow sports shirt and a dark cotton pants and was not wearing shoes. Next to it was a man lying also in a sports shirt with white stripes.
A few meters later, there was another body dressed in a red sports shirt and blue cotton pants.
All three lay facing the ground.
According to the data obtained on the scene, all three persons were likely killed elsewhere because they were not hit.
Messages were found on the floor of the chateau addressed to one group of organised crime of the other and also a series of bullets trails, both on the building and on the door.
In Cadereyta, 11 suspects were detained
The National Defence Secretary presented 11 persons, including youth who were members of the criminal group, who operated in particular in the area of Cadereyta and who were associated with rape, murder, prosecution and illegal burial.
According to the information published at the first attempt on 11 November in the Los Alveros colony, 8 persons were detained and one person detained was released.
Three property and mobile phone were secured, confirmed to be members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
The next move took place on November 12th at 6 o'clock. Military personnel were on duty in the Rancho Viejo area in Cadereyt when they noticed a car without a SPZ and two people in it.
After stopping the car, they took a look and discovered one gun, a trigger, and 18 bullets.
Then, on the basis of these statements, on 13 November around 14 a.m., one of the complicities in La Frauda was detained.
They were accused of illegal burial in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday, a new Italian government will be appointed
The appointed President of the government, Mario Monti, will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to present to him a new government that will face the crisis that holds this country over the collapse of the economic disaster.
The appointed President of the government, Mario Monti, will meet with the Italian President tomorrow to present to him a new government that will face the crisis that holds this country over the collapse of the economic disaster and which has put the whole euro area at risk.
The Presidential Palace has issued a report announcing that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorg Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can create a government.
It is expected to represent a government with a complex majority of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti announced that he would present to the president the results of his talks with the political parties in an effort to create a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner for Journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say he would be able to create a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
"The frame is now well marked," he added.
Monti has completed the process of creating a government in just three days, which is much shorter than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to fight the political and financial crisis, which has resulted in debt reaching an unsustainable level.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Montim, must approve a strong package of economic measures that the European leaders require, and only this will be possible to restore Italy's navigable credibility.
Monti is under great pressure to accelerate. Due to the instability of the markets, they have exceeded interest rates from Italian bonds BTP with a ten-year validity of 7 per cent limit, the level when Greece and Ireland had to apply for rescue.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian employers' organization Confindustria, told reporters after meeting with Montim: "We have said that we are very supportive of this government".
We believe that this government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this delicate situation.
Monti's hopes for success were greatly reciprocated thanks to the support of PDL Silvia Berlusconi, whose crisis forced him to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are intended for good results," Angelina Alfano, the media secretary, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, the largest Italian party, is important because so far, the entire number of its members have turned against the government with the technical majority that Monti is making up.
Support to Parliament
The new Montenegrin government must have strong support for Parliament in order to promote non-popular economic reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in this effort could lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks added to the pressure and warned that Monti's failure could mean disaster.
Monti started talks with political parties, committees and business groups, youth and women's organisations on Monday.
The round of proceedings will end on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed President of Naples on Sunday, which enabled a very rapid process in response to the crisis.
After a short decrease at the end of last week, when it was already apparent that Berlusconi was giving a demise, the interest in Italian bonds had returned to the critical border and were thus reacting to uncertainty as to whether the new government president would succeed.
To save Italy, whose public debt is moving to EUR 1.8 billion, would be beyond the scope of the current financial reserves of the euro area.
Monti stated that his government should remain in power until the next elections that are scheduled for 2013, despite the general forecasts that the politicians are only giving him time to make reforms, and then announces the early elections.
Monti stated that he would like to join his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this government must be composed only of experts to bring Italy out of the difficulties the country has experienced because of the financial pressure.
Political sources have said that mutual mistrust and disagreement between the parties complicate attempts to join the government and political personality.
Spanish participants in international matches more frequently than Costa Rican
Of the 22 Spanish footballers, ten cross the 50 international matches.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 successful players reached 50 matches.
A huge contrast on the Costa Rican side, compared to 22 players from both countries who met today at a friendly match at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
While the world and Europe champions, number one FIFA monthly rating, have on their account a wide range of Class A inter-election matches, Costa Rica has only Michael Uman's defender, who as the only player played 50 international games.
This number reached last Friday at the Rommel Fernández Stadium in the fight against Panama (0-2).
Spanish footballers who play in the Utkaja stars and in the powerful clubs of the English first leagues have been holding intensive activity on league championships and home Cups and high-level matches within European Cups such as the Champions League for the Year.
We must also add the experience of the national Spanish team in the complex competitions for the European and world championships.
Costa Rican players, on the other hand, have very limited opportunities for foreign matches in the area. There is, for example, Concacaf, which is considered to be the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the largest number of foreign matches from the Spanish representation has on his account the Blogger Iker Casillas, who last Saturday before England (losing 0-1 in London) reached the former Blogger Andoni Zubizarret with 126 international matches.
Casillas will come up against Costa Rica today and win a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona's key player, has 106 matches on his account.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially declared UEFA last week along with other Spanish players who have a hundred matches on their account. Among them the mentioned Zubizarreta is 126 and the middle attacker Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Charles Puyol, with 97 matches, got close for a hundred.
The following are Xabi Alonso, 91; Fernando Torres, 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both 81; Andrés Inista, 62; Cesc Fábregas, 61; and David Silva, 53.
On the Costa Rican side and close to Michael Uman, the left wing of Junior Díaz moves with 48 matches and Bryan Ruiz with 45.
In addition, only 5 crossed the 30-game limit: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofefifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
Minimum number of matches.
With less than 30 matches in Spain, Gerard Pique (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31) are represented.
On the national side with less than 30 matches is Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
Not more than 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
The best shooter in Spain is David Villa with 50 goals and followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the ecclesiastical side, Bryan Ruiz, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its tour on the occasion of a 20-year anniversary of existence
"The road to Costa Rica is a dream that becomes a reality"
In an exclusive conversation for Viva, founder Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam said that the group is ready to offer one of the best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
We have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the group itself assures them that the possibility of playing at Costa Rica is a fulfilled dream.
That's what the baseman and founding member of Jeff Ament said, who spoke exclusively to Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is located on the South American continent as part of a tour on the occasion of a 20-year anniversary of its existence and will be at a unique stop in Central America on Sunday 20.
This day will take place from 19:30 at the National Stadium together with the English band The X and national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is a sample of the interview that you will find the entire review on La Nazion's website.
Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are enjoying?
The road to Costa Rica is also our dream that becomes a reality.
In South and Central America, we barely had a second and a half experience.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation, and it's a beautiful country and I believe we'll be able to kill here for a few days.
So we're so glad we can bring you our music.
I wonder, because here the group literally adores, the fans are having these days preparing very intensively.
What do you say to your most rock lovers?
Thank you for staying with us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years before we got to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and sorry for us that it took so long.
Some people are already talking about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Is that causing more pressure in you?
Some of the biggest shows we've had in the past 21 years have been on the horizon for a few weeks.
We've had some great shows in Sao Paulo, and we hope that's how we got into the form of a Costa Rican concert.
We're really looking forward to the concert.
We love this country, we like to serve, we like jungles, and for both activities Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you meet Costa Rica and her waves suitable for surfing?
We have a lot of surfing friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo.
My friends are going to surf Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico. These are the best surfing places, and so we learned about Costa Rica through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tour, you've prepared a huge show with a lot of songs.
What were you planning on doing on your presentation at Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, we have no limits on what we can't do.
We'll try to show the best show with various songs. We'll try to play some songs from every album and introduce our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 compositions and everyone likes other compositions, so it's hard to choose which songs we'll play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven't played for a long time, we focus on them and we're also surprised because we remember why we liked them so much and that we may have forgotten about them.
So it's more interesting for us to show, and that's why I think it's more interesting for people.
This tour celebrates 20 years of art trails.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yeah, I'm sure it is.
First, I don't think any of us could have imagined that we'd be in a big rock band and we'd be staying in it for more than 20 years.
We realize how much we have been given and we realize that we can still play together.
We love each other and we like to create music.
We're lucky we can look at places we've always wanted.
We couldn't get any better.
What did it mean to you that you were an important part of the generation of grunge?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group in which the great ones are represented.
The people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It's surprising when a movement comes from a group of friends, it doesn't happen very often.
From time to time, there will be a group in the city, but it is much less common to take five to ten groups from one city to another.
We're proud of it and we're honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we play with some.
Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on the tour. We are lucky that they are all our friends and we are honored that we can be part of this movement that arose in Seattle.
It is also very unusual for a group like yours to stay together and have the same members after those years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which is already much longer than the usual duration of the group.
I think first of all, we're all lucky that we're still in this world, and second of all, we're playing our part in the fact that we're always interested in each other.
All of us are close friends, and this has made it possible for us to open the music paths that leave every person enough freedom for his own experimentation.
We trust each other, we respect each other's music, and I don't think it could be better.
Your relationship to the word of glory was not easy, but thanks to your success you can do what you like.
How do you find balance?
The more we grew up, the easier it was to find a balance.
We try not to go too far, because it is very easy to fall into this trap of dwarves and people who love our music.
When you realize that people have come for music, remember that you have to respect music and what you have given it. You can't let yourself be taken away by being famous, rock stars.
How do you remember another Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote great songs, and at first it was something great.
As a band, we have existed for three years and we have never released any albums until after Andrew Woods died.
It was very frustrating, because it took so long. The most important thing is that even today we are friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us. When I listen to some song or watch pictures, I remember Andy, how amazing how I was with him. It was always the joy to work with him, laugh, play music or football and so many others.
She was an incredible person, and we miss her so much.
The Las Robertas National Chapel will be entrusted with launching a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose them as the first jumpers?
Yes, production sent us videos with a few suggestions and we liked this group the most. That's why we're curious what Las Robertas is offering and must be very fun.
Why do you always change the words of Yellow Ledbetter alive?
That's Eddie Vedder, so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he adds the first thing he thinks he does.
Who's influencing you as a basstalt?
A lot of people.
I'm the first to be attacked by Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many of them that I could talk all night about bassists that I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the brunge, though it's no longer fashionable?
I think we've all always felt a light separation from the word grunge.
When you say grunge, I imagine groups that I mentioned as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time. And even if today such music is valid, it's something great because it's music that is worth listening to and groups like Mudhoney today play better music than ever before.
At first, your music was slightly cloudy and is now more positive.
What's behind this change?
This is interesting, because I feel that in the new album there are some compositions that are easier to rip, but there are also songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very cloudy, although they may sound positive.
At both of them, when Ed played it for me, I cried, and it's deep dark.
I think if you grow up and have some trauma in your life, you lose a family or a friend, these things start to affect your art and music, and these two songs for me represent this.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again due to medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital on Tuesday, where he will be tested for muscle loss, which he suffers from in the lower limbs, informed his curative doctor.
The 72 - year - old Fujimori, who repudiates 25 years of deprivation of liberty for human rights violations committed by his government (1990 - 2000), suffers from several diseases, including cancer of the tongue, for which he has been operated four times and is currently under control by doctors.
Ambassador Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told Canal N television station that Fujimori would undergo tests at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases in three days, where they should find out why he is suffering and why he is losing his strength in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga said that, in his opinion, Fujimori could obtain mercy for humanitarian reasons, but the former president himself does not want mercy because he feels innocent.
He was operated four times because of the cancer of the tongue, matched 18 kilograms, and added to these problems other diseases such as severe erosion gastritis, spleen cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulation problems in the legs, appointed a doctor.
Fujimori has been serving a sentence since September 2007 at the National Directorate for Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, 25 people were sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people who killed the killing squad of an illegal army in the first years of his government.
Mujica on a visit to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by the Uruguayan President, José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and businessmen, will start on Tuesday's visit to Mexico. Its aim is to achieve the expansion of trade between both nations and to address the political issues in the region.
On Wednesday, Mujica meets with her Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón. It is the most important meeting of a wide-ranging meeting with representatives of politics, trade and representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayan presidential office.
The meeting of both presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political issues between both countries," the Uruguayan president's office published on its websites.
According to local media, Mujica will try to persuade Calderón to support Uruguay in a dispute with France, which occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy listed the South American country as a G20 tax haven in Cannes.
In his speech to Sarkozy, he threatened that the countries that would continue to remain in the position of tax havens would be expelled from the international community, which called for a negative opinion from Uruguay and for consultation with the Ambassador in this European country.
Mexico is president of the G20 since November. The G20 is a group made up of the most powerful developing and developed countries in the world. With the said Latin American country, the agreement on the exchange of information to prevent double taxation has been concluded since January of this year.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has sought to concreteise the fiscal exchange agreement with the aim of obtaining from the "black paper" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which are countries that have not implemented all the international standards of tax cooperation required.
From a commercial point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have since 2004 concluded the Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which has strengthened trade between the two countries.
The vocal installer runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been struggling tirelessly for over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the evils of Bowser, but has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title that comes this month into all the shops around the world has been created from the beginning to use all the features offered by the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
"Mario is a character that has to say how stereoscopy without glasses works," said a press officer specializing in Nintendo in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during a video game presentation in Madrid.
Alvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game specially created for this carrier", because so far successful images such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" have been adapted to existing titles.
Speaker Nintendo said that in addition to the picture is 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and gasy game.
Alvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", whose task is to attract less comfortable users.
Once you have reached this level, you can go to the "second wheel" on the level games that are more demanding this time.
Moreover, users can choose real time between "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. But it will be necessary to play in 3D in order to overcome the most diverse challenges and "not subject to optical error".
This new Super Maria entry in 3D also assumes the return of the character to a portable console, which has not come to pass since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo plays into the notes to those who follow and repeat a successful formula from previous works. It is based on the fact that the installation of a man will have to go through dangerous abandoned platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds news in the movement, in the surroundings, in the costumes and also among the enemies, Luigi will also appear "game".
Colom approved Portilla's release to the United States
President Alvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had taken steps to issue former President Alfonse Portilla, who is supposed to be responsible in the United States for a conspiracy to wash 70 million dollars.
This is the end of the process aimed at meeting Guatemala's demand for a northern country that requires Portilla to be issued so that it can be tried.
At the Colom press conference, he confirmed that his decision was in line with the independence of the judiciary and that he remembers that the criminal court had already ordered the issue.
He ensured that during his term of office, he "did not interfere" with the judicial decisions and allowed all the publications he had obtained on his desk.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be released for murder and serious health damage and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's action means a step in the execution after all the judicial and constitutional authorities have been exhausted to conduct proceedings against the former President who ruled in 2000-2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be issued after its legal situation is resolved in Guatemala and will be guaranteed respect for human rights.
Portillo was searched for innocent in the event of a return of 120 million to the Ministry of Defence at the time of his presidency. This process preceded the issue, but the Ministry of Public Affairs appealed and returned the case to the game.
Trinije helped 6000 young people in danger
The organization was born to help children without education, not to feel on the edge of society.
For the first 25 years, the existence of the organization of social support for Trinity is very important: 6,000 young people who were threatened by social exclusion have been helped.
To this end, a long number of jobs have been acquired for this social group.
Yesterday's anniversary also served to present a balance sheet under the solemn act that took place in the former Fabra and Coats factory premises and attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijo's organization was founded in the Trinitat Vella quarter of 1986 with the aim of helping young people with low education, without work dealing with drug addiction or in a situation where they could fall into social exclusion.
Yesterday's meeting in Sant Andreu was attended by a large number of representatives of organisations and institutions who have worked with the association over the past 25 years.
The diverse political representation, during the election time, showed the uniform nature of the work carried out by the Trinity.
Together with President Generalitat, Arthur Mass, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, former socialist education adviser Ernest Maragall and former deputy mayor and current environmental and socialist councillor Richard Goma participated.
In the large hall Fabra and Coats were also provided with current Social Welfare and Family Adviser, Josep Lluís Cleries, and Director General of Social Work in La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinijo had been born in a very difficult time and that today's time also presents a number of obstacles, but added that the work that the association has brought to this day is "a good foundation".
The President gave Trinijo an example of how to fight adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is not for this organization and for the work it does, nothing new," he said.
There's been a ban on the house where giant parties were held
The sailors built 11 out of 13 apartments in a building in Balmes, 51
12 occupiers left the house yesterday afternoon without putting up with the resistance
It all testifies to the fact that the nightmare experienced by the neighbors at number 51 in Balmes Street is finally over.
Yesterday 12 people voluntarily left the building, which they illegally resided in, where they organized giant parties, which they built next door. They left the building from the court regulation, without having to interfere with the police.
After the operation was completed, a lock was replaced on the door to prevent recurrence.
"From now on, the entrance will be monitored," the manager said.
Occupants who took 11 out of 13 apartments in the building - the remaining ones are inhabited - took all electrical and partly and water appliances, also painted the walls and left behind all kinds of waste, especially alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments there were huge parties, which lasted up to two days and which brought the rest of the tenants.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to the European Press that during the time the building was occupied, the markets fell by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque points out that the occupants of the building did not compete because they sold drinks for 3 euros, where the discotheque is worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment company had to respond to the noise claims of the neighbors. However, the problems did not affect the visitors of the discotheque, but the residents of the house being taken away, and in particular those who attended regular parties, whose frequency and intensity in recent weeks have grown, depending on the distraught inhabitants of the neighborhood.
The disco owner explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building and had forgiven her rent for nine months.
City police have also confirmed that over the past few weeks they have received more complaints from their neighbors about the situation.
The president of the city group of the People's Party of PP at the council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week demanded that "the building be immediately moved and ended with problems of civil coexistence which the neighbors suffer and destruction of the area".
The president explained that only one step had been taken before the summer, but in recent months the occupiers have reached all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments, and even in one of them there has been theft.
In this regard, he added that "it is necessary to end impunity and to be consistent when it comes to the effects on civil liability that occurred in the building".
The city police also cleaned the building in Nou Barris yesterday.
At 3:30 p.m., the police arrived at a building 35 on Mont-ral Street after she was summoned by neighbors who saw four people enter the building.
All four were immediately detained.
Park or mountains?
Architects met on the occasion of the publication of proceedings which bear more than a dispute regarding fees
The municipal election procedure on 16 gates opens again a debate on the role of the Collserol Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-80s, at the time of the largest bloom, the Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB) was already invented, this self-government printed several pamphlets in support of the Collserola Park.
The pilot defined the mountain as a large metro park in Barcelona.
More than that, it was complemented by a numerical comparison with the New York Central Park.
After CMB disappeared in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many as the upper boundary of Barcelona. The Catalan metropolis is one of the few that do not focus on the north - south but up (mountain) - down (sea).
The qualification of Collesola as a natural park goes this way.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wildlings instead of Yogi bears.
This was the position until September when the mayor announced a mega competition of 16 competitions for the same number of entrances to Collesola.
The gate, of course, records more of the park's thinking.
It's either this or someone's trying to put the door on the field.
So the only question is: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both from a purely organisational point of view and based on a reflection on the city, this issue becomes the focus of all Barcelona architects.
It's already the same thing as two members of this old caste chosen when they meet in the lift hand.
And that's exactly what one of the rare similarities between what the three Barcelona architects think and the leading university professors think.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The election procedure has its own justification.
According to Roldán, after the question of the Gulf side began, "you must also discuss the "mountain side", so Ildefonse Cerd's speech on green apples was not affected to the end.
"We must come from the principle that the longest Barcelona park is the beach.
Among other things, your great availability.
Collserol is more complex," said an architect, for whom the name "the door to Collserol" in itself is "lexicological paste": we cannot imagine them "as entrances to the park, but rather as a delimitation of areas where it is possible to operate".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayon, with the experience of the world of urbanism characterizes a proposal as "intellectual challenge" referring to "some dangers".
The danger stemming from the "inexistence which today represents the project of a public place" after the experience of the 1980s, which had in the field of the Forum "its own drumming of songs".
The first fear is the very definition of the boundaries where it should be built.
"Something to define means to take another step already," that is basically to move on.
"There is a need to keep in mind new urbanist and planning tools, because the current (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (GPM)) can cause a real hole."
If we focus more on the question, Modol believes that the valley slope of Collserol can be "considered a park", but the Barcelona part is not, for reasons purely topographical.
The Modol also recalled that there is already a work done by Patronat de Collserol, which "should not end in the trash", although it welcomes the fact that the council member offers his team to hit the project from the "first moment".
Moreover, it understands that the proximity of the mountain and the city is a kind of failure that allows architects to get involved in the debate, but "he doubts" that it should be this technical profile that will lead multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skill") that should be created: "architects should only be tools".
Bayona points out that the answer to the question that called this game is complex, because in the basis for the selection process there is a lack of the global vision of Collserol: "There have been 16 selection procedures that deal with all the axis of the mountains - the sea, but there is no further study that would look at the area and understand it as a whole".
This means that at least he has applied for all 16 election procedures.
Otherwise, the project of one gate may affect the concept and definition of the neighboring gate architect.
In his opinion, the councillor should guarantee that the zone immediately above Ronda de Dalt should provide throughout the area of equipment that would ensure a gas transition between the city and the green.
Casino passed Jonási Larrazábal, which will be released
After 72 days of imprisonment, the legal officer Cadino Red granted mercy to his brother, Mayor Monterrey, in the process in which he was sued for alleged extortion.
Manuel Jonás Larrazábal spent 72 days in prison, and now he will be released after the legal officer Casino Red granted him mercy before the Second Criminal Court in a given district, which discussed the case of an interrogation in which the mayor's brother Monterrey was accused.
After the assassination of Casino Royale owner Casino Red, Sergio Gil Garcia, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás had to apply for an economic quota to allow the city council to operate illegally in a betting house.
Following a public complaint, the State Prosecutor's Office began the criminal prosecution of the Punishing Brother. On 2 September, he was detained and imprisoned for 30 days.
After 4 hours spent in front of the Public Ministry Agent No. 3 for property crimes, he was transferred to Prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo, the capital of the state.
He remained in this place for the next 49 days after the second regulation was issued to the prison and the public ministry agent withdrew the possibility of co-sponsored or organised crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to a criminal court in Cadereyta for suspected extortion of the owners of Casino Red as one and a half million pesos. However, he remained only a few hours in prison with moderately heavy surveillance because he was threatened with death.
The leading representatives allowed him to stay in the city halls in San Nicolas de los Garza during the process.
On 25 October, he was ordered to be arrested by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who declared that, almost two months after the investigation, sufficient evidence had been gathered to prove Jonah's guilt.
This Monday, the legal officer Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, delivered to Judge José Luis Pecin and asked for mercy for the brother of the mayor of the region. On this basis he will be able to return to freedom soon.
During the legal proceedings with the representative of the Public Ministry assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gomez whether the damage had been corrected and which of the partners decided to grant mercy. But the lawyer made it clear that the name would remain hidden.
On the basis of the official file 197/2011, the lawful mercy of Jonási Larrazábal shall be granted. In the proceedings against him, no complaint will be possible. Nor can we ask for damages or punishment.
After re-trialing with the legal authority around 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazábal Breton.
The secretary of the court, Jorge Yanez, arrived in the prison in San Nicolas de los Garza to inform Jonas that he had been granted official mercy and his case was deposited in the archive.
He also informed him that the judge had issued an immediate regulation on his release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome presented details of the plane crash, in which the secretary of Governor Francisco Blake and seven others died.
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) informed that the results of the accident investigation, in which the secretary of the government of Francisco Blake Mora died, and seven others, indicate that the helicopter hit the site directly with full force, without the pilot having a chance to attempt forced landing.
At the press conference Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communications and Transport, stated that before the launch of the aircraft, the pilot found that climate conditions allowed for years.
"Parts that appear testify that the unit has come into contact with the field several times, the wings have been intertwined into the trunk of the trees 25 meters from the place where the unit has lost the body."
He also informed that the unit was intended for 19 persons and therefore met all requirements for the transport of staff.
Furthermore, he stated that no parts were found on the ground on the basis of an investigation carried out in the field of rape.
"In the search, it was found that parts of the aircraft were not located elsewhere, so the plane hit the ground as a complete one.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 people, meeting all requirements for the carriage of persons.
The terrain shows a slope of up to seven to thirty degrees.
The Secretary has ensured that at the present time it is most important to obtain the fastest results. However, the investigation may take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, announced that at the time of the attack, the helicopter of the Presidential General Staff was moving at a speed of travel and an accident occurred in a soft retreat.
"This information supports the hypothesis that it was a regular transit operation during the accident," he said.
At the press conference, the representative of SCT Pérez Jácome appointed six basic examination points:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the aviation standards, the flight was carried out in accordance with the visual flight rules, which means that the crew must see on the ground during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
The AICM reports indicate adequate conditions at the start, according to which the aircraft is heading at the border, between the DF and the State of Mexico were visible layers obscured at low altitudes.
Selected paths:
It is likely that the dark crew was looking for a lower area and greater visibility to the Cuernavac valley.
The location of the attack.
The collision coordinates and the last record of the helicopter from the radar agree, it is likely that there has been no loss of control before the attack or a failure of the flight path.
Dispersal of aircraft residues in a restricted area:
The information we have currently available enables us to assume that the damage has occurred on the same track and on the other hand.
The layout of the aircraft residue indicates that at the time of the attack on the ground the helicopter was celestial.
There was no fire or explosion.
There was no evidence at the scene that there was an explosion or a fire.
The final results of the investigation indicate that several solid contacts could occur.
During field work, aircraft residues were found up to 9200 feet above sea level, the terrain is being refurbished, and the altitude is ranging from seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show pictures where there was probably a breakdown along the routes mentioned above.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter could have reached contact with the country in several locations.
After a careful survey of the area surrounding the accident, no remains of the helicopter were found in the area larger than the area of the landing, which reinforces the belief that the helicopter was in a condition where the helicopter was still stationary.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance launched a gene research that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research in order to identify the gene responsible for children and adolescents. The research is carried out with the support of experts from the IPN Institute.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting research aimed at discovering a gene causing obesity in children and young people. Research called "Genetic obesity in children and young people" will be able to obtain results regarding overweight.
In a report by the Research Medical Unit in the field of biochemistry from the specialized hospital of the National Health Centre of the 21st century, Miguel Cruz López explained that a multidisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutrition experts and social workers was established.
This team is supported by experts and students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and from the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
Joining the research can also be a wide public, with or without authorization. People can come to the IMSS sports centres in Valle de México, where they will conduct tests with young people every 8 hours.
He stressed that the research started at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Centre (Mexico State) and since 8 October this activity is also carried out at the Nezahualcoyolt Sports Centre (East Mexico State).
Once data are obtained from 500 children to 600 children, the study will continue at the Sport Centre of Independentia (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Sport Centre Morelos (south of the Federal Centre).
He explained that the aim of this research is to identify the components and importance of genetics in terms of the development of obesity and to identify risk factors for children and young people in Mexico and thus prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Day of Diabetes, which is celebrated on 14 November, he recalled that the aim is to gather data from three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14 with the consent and supervision of parents for the application of specific nutrition questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also be asked about the physical activity and family history of inherited diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause disease such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He explained that an anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist), blood pressure are measured, glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin are determined every Saturday, and genes are tested (an attempt is made to identify genes that participate in the development of childhood obesity).
Cruz López noted that this research reflects the concerns of the health care professionals about the alarming increase in the child’s weight.
'Health surveys carried out between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years there was only 77% obesity among boys and 47% among girls. There was also a dramatic increase in overweight,' said IMSS expert.
He stated that one of the reasons for the search for indicators is the belief that the country's population differs from other populations in its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% of Indian-American genetic equipment, 30% European and 5% African.
He explained that the general genetics of obesity are usually explained as inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calorie) and stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of participants is that they will receive an overall assessment of the state of the children, which will determine whether they show any known overweight or obesity.
He pointed out that even the presence of acantosis (acantosis) on the neck and the forehead suggests that the individual is likely to suffer from metabolic problems and pre-diarrhoea conditions.
The information is confidential so far, doctors hand it over in writing to parents and explain to them all the measurements and changes in life - style that they have to make in order for their children to avoid disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary way of life that means a lack of daily physical activity, full-day sitting before television and using means of transport instead of walking for short distances.
The excess also causes a large caloric intake, which is greater consumption of sweetened drinks, carbohydrates (tumbles, bread, pizza, burgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and genetic burden, which is the subject of this research.
In Asphalt from UNAM there will be no exodus
Rafael Herrera, a scientist at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, creates modified asphalts with polymers and thus creates a mixture with better functionality, regardless of climate conditions and temperature
If it was properly cared for by lightning, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200 thousand discharges after each rainy period in the Valle de México Metropolitan area, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, a scientist at the Chemical Faculty (FQ) of UNAM, who at the same time added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt discharges were adequate, there would be a significant limitation of the discharges, or even could be completely removed.
In his lecture The Technological Cause of Fever, which he made in the International Year of Chemistry, announced that a laboratory under his direction develops modified asphalts with polymers, which should produce a mixture with similar characteristics asphalt, but at the same time greater mechanical strength, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Nájera believes that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely warm climate, for example in some cities in the north of the country.
He explained that asphalt, the most heavy part of the oil, is a collection of hydrocarbons molecules, molecules with a large molecular mass called asphaltenes, and others with a low molecular mass called maltenes. Together, they supply asphalt with a typical viscoelastic character.
The viscoelastic character of asphalt is that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves as liquid, at 120 degrees it has high viscosity and at 50 degrees it is almost solid, while at low temperatures the asphalt tends to collapse, added.
This means that asphalt resistance in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to weather conditions and temperatures, the expert on chemical engineering noted.
A scientist at the Chemical Faculty observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de México are covered by a flexible painting, consisting of six types of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the top layers is the asphalt cartridge, made of small stones in the asphalt and then compressed.
He stressed that every stone that forms a stick is tossed with asphalt.
When passing the car or creating the pressure, it is possible for the forces in the tank to spread well.
If it were modified asphalt, it would spread even better, a chemical engineer would think.
He added that on the asphalt cartridge there is the last layer called the coating, made of fine stone, that is, sand poured into the asphalt.
Since this layer will come into contact with the vehicle ramps, it must have greater mechanical strength than the asphalt cartridge and must ensure the friction of the vehicle.
Given that as part of the suction, a heavy load will have to be carried out, it must have a sufficient thickness and must pay attention to the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor that needs to be remembered. In particular, water has a great influence on the function of the asphalt cartridge.
Once the area is wet, the water spreads inside and it's hard to get out, it causes all kinds of wetlands to soften and thus create mollusks.
He explained that during the production of the cracks, as the first discontinuing film of the coat and until then there is damage to the asphalt cartridge. However, there is no damage at one time, but it is a process that should be stopped by the first signs using suitable maintenance programs.
As a member of the National Science System, he also explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in the creation of the mollusks, and therefore the thickness of each layer of the paint must correspond to the weight of the vehicles and must guarantee that the load does not exceed.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that asphalt is still waiting for us, and research is at the outset. For example, it is worth mentioning asphalt emulsion, which is already available in other countries on the market and allowing for easy repair without having to use high temperatures.
What did the Valle candidate miss about becoming a new Miss Columbia?
Analysis of the factors that contributed to Melina Ramírez Serna's failure to get Miss Colombia crown.
So Vale gets the 14th title of the first multi-mission.
Valle del Cauca did not reach Miss Colombia again.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied that she felt on the podium of the winners, got a silver crown and a scarf, on the basis of which she became the new first multimissis of Colombia.
On the basis of the results of yesterday's final in Cartagena, in which Miss Atlántico was defeated and stabbed, the department was given the first title. Melina thus joined the representations of women from Valle del Cauca, who were finally declared the first vice president. Among them are Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellina Ayala (1979), Lorena Alzate (1981), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blance (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcès Aljuraldo (2000), Aljure (2000).
The question many are asking.
The result is the defeat of a great favorite that has shown in all previous wheels that it has to become a new Miss Colombia, and not become free of charge the Royal Police and the most beautiful face of Joel de Volgue. These titles have been achieved, for example, by Italiana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who subsequently took the title Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury had decided to appoint her as the first multimission is the fact that she did not convince her answer to the question: "Which book did you like most and why?" by Martin Murillo Gómez of Leamos' literary edition.
The candidate answered the question:
"Read more. I believe very much in the role of literature, I think it's one of the forms of culture. The book that influenced me most in my childhood was the "Small Prince", a very deep book.
It is a book that is part of the world literature that we should all know, and today I have a book from Irene Nemirovski, Russian authors, called El Ardor de la sangre.
However, this answer was not welcome because of the term "culturalisation" and the second because the candidate did not explain what the individual books mentioned had noted.
After the end of the celebration, Melina declared that she was calm and happy with the result: "The world is wise what is going to happen, it will happen.
And you people, read if you can.
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed her favorite position.
The Bogotá journalist pointed out that from the beginning the candidate was the most popular, unpopular, and the one who brought all the previous prices (Gastronomic challenge Oster, the title of the public for the best art dress and the Queen's mother), aroused the envy of other guests, shook the queen, who then burned on the stage.
It was visible during the first presentation of beaches on Hilton and during two screenings before the final coronation.
Even though she was on both, she was aware that she was lacking the power and flame that the Magdalena and Atlántico representatives had.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "As Home" program at the Canal RCN, believes that Melinda has won the title of the first multi-mission confirms the fact that the candidate, who gets the most titles during the competition, finally does not leave with the crown of the queen".
In addition, Valle has been more rude to the media in recent days and has not been paid back.
Another hypothesis is that Vale was unable to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Competition of Beauty.
Just on the border, two days before the election, the international jury member Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who would be aware of the social needs of her country.
"In the competition Miss Colombia beauty itself is not enough, it is necessary to see something more than physical beauty. It is necessary to focus on social feelings. It is important that the candidates are involved in such projects before entering the competition," she explained.
It also speculates that Valle's candidate lost points because of her lack of background and fibrosis, which was visible on the back of her ass. But this is quite contrary to the jury's verdict, which chose her miss "natural beauty" for the most healthy body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who prepares for the queen, admits that Melina didn't have the best body that there were better girls here, "but problems with fibrosis on her ass, which in my opinion was not too familiar, dressed her up until the last day".
In the meantime, journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos is believed to have made a mistake when she underwent several surgical procedures.
"Surgery is okay, but they didn't make it in Valle.
The body was never her strong side and here she chose her tax."
Because of this award, which was first given by the National Beauty Assembly, after a survey of the swimsuits, there was a cruel prediction that had been fulfilled. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymondo Melini wanted to avoid finally having to give her the highest crown.
Whether it is true or not, it is certain that Melina has started today the year of her reign, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in various international competitions, where she will be named the National Competition itself.
However, it is recorded in history as one of the queens who, despite the overwhelming success of Cartagena, did not reach the highest crown.
This was the work of a cali resident who identified Alfonse Cana's corpse.
A fingerprint expert from Cali went into history as a man who confirmed Alfons Cana's death.
The work of these officers is key.
On November 4th last year, an expert on CTI fingerprints in Cali entered history as a man who confirmed the identity of the highest leader Farc: "Alfonse Cana", through comparison of fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working in the CTI department, this week was a week of the series at Elizar González, a man from Puerto Tejad, who has been working in the field of judicial research for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career González worked at a councillor in Chocó, where he often had to spend more than five days in the laundry to get to the place where the dead were to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the main city of Valle and, after graduating from the courses, began specializing in fingerprints. This science deals with the study of skin cutting, which is hand and foot.
During the week of the operation against that Alfonsi Can, Eliezer was told to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night, he went to Cauca in a helicopter from Palmir.
He knew he would have to identify two dead men and suspect that one of them was the man who led the oldest guerilla in the world, so they asked her to take a card with Guillerm Leon Sáenze's fingerprints (his real name).
However, when he came with the investigating team to the place where the dead man was, he didn't recognize her because of his physical vision, and he looked completely different from the media.
He had no hair, dressed as a villager in the area, without glasses, much more quiet.
But the prints don't leak.
Along with Galton's lupus, ink and transplanter and light, Eleazar began to compare the fingerprints of the dead with the records from the map.
Her eye was not disappointed: it was Alfonso Cano.
That very night, a man from Puerto Tejad was assigned to confirm to the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was really the Supreme Commander Farc.
Looking for traces
For the dactyloscope from Sijín de Cali, the recognition shown by President Juan Manuel Santos to Elizar González at the press conference of Operational Services against Cano is very important.
A lot of people don't know our job.
Dactyloscope is an exact science, without the possibility of a mistake that can play a key role in deciding on criminal acts.
In addition to the identification of the dead, these people assist in the investigation of criminal acts such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the persons captured.
When caught, many delinquents present false documents or have no papers at all.
We take their fingerprints and we're looking for them in the database.
The investigator reported that in case of injury, he had to remove a piece of wall in the house, because in this place he was more determined to pull out a treasure full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult, because they are not intended to take prints, but in this case we were able to obtain the print of the whole hand and identify the perpetrator who participated in several thefts," he reminded.
Fingerprints may also confirm or reverse suspicion in case of murder.
Recently they found a dead man with a bottle of alcohol around them.
On the basis of the investigation, it was found that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder and that the print on the bottle actually confirmed it.
Although it's not 100% confirmed that he was a real killer, it's obvious that he appeared on the scene.
An expert on fingerprints from CTI explained that the prints are "stamped with chemical or physical reactive substances" from the articles.
When it appears, a transplanter or tape shall be used for their collection.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, which is the delinquency database, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that at present there are still many Colombians whose data are nowhere to be found," said a CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI television program.
Just like everything that trembles, there's no gold, not anything you touch, there's no trace left.
However, if it can be used, appropriate comparisons must be made.
"Insurgency" protests in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators were pushed into the Zuccotti square, where they wanted to live.
A large part of them waited for an order to clear the area and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Movement Obsess Wall Street provoked on Tuesday representatives of New York when they tried by court order to get back to Manhattan Square, where they were expelled in the morning, and then tried to pick up another New York park.
Hundreds of demonstrators pressed to the Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get by a court order that allowed the "damaged" to return to their seats. The second part of the movement reacted to the cleaning by taking the park to the north of the city where further detention occurred.
"If the court doesn't allow us to go back to the square, we'll sit somewhere else and we'll continue in the legal battle with the aim of returning to Zuccitti, both through the assembly and through such peaceful demonstrations," said one of the speakers of the Wall Street Movement, Mark Bray.
Bray made clear that the answer to the "comfort" to the removal of the camp, which was ordered by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg himself, reached the court where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced removal of the camp and allowed the protesters to remain here.
In addition to the "heating", another park was taken to the crossroads of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the ferry land in Trinity Church.
At least one hour they managed to take the place, but then the police came and held some protesters.
The organization ensures that several hundred people have settled in the area, and a delegation of religious representatives has also come to express support for them, as well as trying to negotiate with the police.
In the meantime, Zuccotti, which is a private property, remains closed. A trial is expected to be held on Tuesday, during which the law of early evacuation should be analysed.
Some of the displaced demonstrators even broadcast and distributed copies of the court order and even gave them to the officials who were watching the square, which caused "some small clashes," said Bray, who condemned the fact that some policemen were demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from moving members of the movement "Ocupa Wall Street" or from using "laws that were published after the beginning of the strike, or from preventing protesters from accessing the park with shops or other places they used previously".
Mayor Bloomberg stated for the press that, in view of this court order, the city stopped the reopening of public space and the protesters pointed out that local laws did not allow them to return to the state and packages.
The highest representative of the city has personally defended the early removal of the Zuccotti Square, an operation in which 200 persons were detained and joined because the protesters were "infringing the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the evacuation of the premises because it was "a place where people didn't protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases to harm others", because "some businesses received dangerous letters" and "neighbored neighbors feared the quality of their lives".
"The early cleansing was alarming and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests for the benefit of the American working people," added the speaker, who accused the mayor of "disregarding freedom of expression".
Representatives of the "Ocupa Wall Street" movement also stated that they planned to organize "great actions" on Thursday in cooperation with community and committee organisations to remind them of two months after the protests took place.
Pamela Anderson will introduce Miss Maria to a special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bublé and other important Canadians will appear on the television program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was assistant to Tim Allen at Home Improvement, swimmer at Baywatch, bunny at Playboy, wife of year-old musician Tommy Lee and now an actress and model will be Miss Mary in a special Christmas series of Canadian television.
The private television station CTV announced today that Anderson, along with the singer of sentimental songs Michael Bubblele and other important Canadians, will appear in the television program "It's and Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December and will be enchanting Ms. Maria.
CTV today showed pictures of the television program, in which Anderson, also known from Internet home pornographic images, appears with his ex-husband, "Mötley Crüe" engine, Tommy Lee, as Miss Maria holding in the oak doll representing Jesus.
As Joseph appears on the scene Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently acted as a moderator for the tour "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" Charlie Sheen.
Crome Anderson and Peters are featured in CTV's special Christmas show by the Canadian singer Bublé, who was married at the end of March in Buenos Aires with the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, who is close to the controversy.
Bublé recently called American Kim Kardashian at one of her concerts in New York City a "cat".
Japan returns to life after a devastating earthquake
GDP is growing by 1.5% thanks to household consumption and ending the fall period that started in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, now recovering from a devastating earthquake that has grown into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that the country has had to face since World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government have counted material losses to 300,000 million dollars, a wound that despite the difficult global situation is well maintained.
After three quarters of the fall, the GDP value between July and September came to such a position that it was possible to turn the page with definitive validity: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% annually.
The results of the second quarter - for Japan tax year starts in March 2012 - also predict the highest rate of growth compared to the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be explained in part by the purchase of machinery necessary for the restoration of the areas destroyed by earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis.
Companies increased their investment by 1.1%, spending decreases by 0.9% over the period from January to March. This is the first reduction after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy is based solely on the momentum that forces us to use the crisis to get out of it, or to rebuild infrastructure.
Japan has woken up, especially thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1% due to increased expenditure on vehicles, roads and leisure activities.
%s (cancelled)
Flows were entrusted to the internal market when yen - Japanese currency - became one of the "saving values" for investors fleeing from the euro area debt crisis and from the disturbing forecasts of the United States.
With more currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for the country whose economy is driven by the financial health of large technological groups.
For example, Toyota or Sonya had their weak results in July to September just a yen course.
While markets remain the border countries of the EU, the Yoshihiko Noda government is cautious.
"We have to pay attention to the risks that persist, such as the destruction of certain foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid increase in yen," state Secretary for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa said yesterday.
And indeed, perspectives are not at all encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) clarified that most Member States showed clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator, which foresees a disadvantage in the world economy, has shown that the economy of major powers is slowing down.
It dropped by four tens to 100.4 points versus 100.8 in August.
The eurozone has even been reached on average at level 100. It has reached a level of 99.13 points.
Athens again spreads uncertainty
Papadimos says the savings measures will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitments
With rapid and risky border guarantees and the uncertainty that has prevailed again, Greece is increasingly involved in the labyrinth that leads to the exit from the great debt crisis in Europe.
The view that the "agreement" of the new transitional Greek government is given more of the requirements of Brussels than the real conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday, admitted that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the 100-day period that he received in his appointment is likely to be short for their application, the chairman of the Conservative party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, announced that the new economic measures would not in any case support and reiterated his demand to issue new elections on the expected date of February 19.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decision of the October 26th summit," Papadimos said yesterday during a parliamentary debate, which will take place tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the government.
A package with 24 programmes to support employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, Samarase's message does not explain any doubt about his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to the help of the transitional government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else."
The chairman of the Conservatives went a little far away to the EU and the IMF. These organisations are supposed to unlock the 8 billion Athens urgently needed. However, he also stated that he would not support and sign any commitments regarding the implementation of the savings measures.
The European Commission, which has already had an impact that caused Papandreou to play with the referendum, stressed yesterday that its requirements are inexhaustible: it does not block any aid unless the new government and representatives of the main parties sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
Speaker for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the Troika will return to Athens "very soon" and will deal with the new government on what "needs to pay for the sixth part" 8 billion.
The Greek prawn has so much more to do with.
Queen Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen raises Spain's position in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has achieved a significant position at global level in terms of microfinance".
The Queen of Sofia yesterday recalled that in the last two decades, the country has become the second donor of the planet in terms of this instrument of cooperation, whose essence lies in "that it is a tool of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind. It is a tool based on trust in man".
The Queen yesterday launched the 5th World Microloans Summit in Valladolid, with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this kind of operation "is absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015. "In particular, it is the achievement of the objectives to achieve a reduction of half the number of people living with less than one dollar a day, i.e. the amount that determines the poverty threshold".
Spain "will continue to work" and expand the network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and takes responsibility for this task", stressed Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and benefits of Summit, which will last until Thursday, "to ensure the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", which are intended in particular.
"We've already reached a lot" and "many challenges are still ahead of us."
The Microloans Summit is intended not only to be a discussion forum, but also a platform that supports "basic objectives".
Her Majesty explained that the aim is to ensure that 175 million poor families have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and that 100 million families get over the poverty threshold under which they currently live.
The concept of microloans extended to Spain and to other states of the world after "what the advance of the idea of Muhammad Yunus on this journey" said the Queen and added that it was "an act of justice and necessary recognition".
The father described this instrument as a "wonderful idealist who set out on the path to combat poverty".He met with his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to meet directly at the site of his loan policy.
The first worldwide summit in Washington and other meetings, such as the Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006. "At all these meetings, I was able to detect constant development, explained the Queen, who, thanks to her support for this project, earned the title "head of the family", which she was given in Valladolid "the movement of the poor".
The Queen of Sofia concluded her speech by urging the participants to engage in discussion and search for solutions and thus to continue in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Ministers Trinidad Jiménez said solidarity "is an ethical imperative" to which all democratic states must be guided.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to combine cooperation with developing countries only with the Balohabite period, because this cooperation is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez believes that micro-loans represent a "serious and honest policy to eliminate poverty", and now more than ever, governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow solidarity to become the victim of scars.
For Spain, microloan is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success that celebrates the concept based on that we give confidence to the people that everyone else closes the door. Mayor Valladolida, Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed participants in a city that "opens its doors to the spirit of solidarity that is contagious".
The CDU proposes to elect a European President on the basis of general electoral law
Without any serious difficulties for the Chancellor and the President of the Christian Democratic Party Angel Merkel held the first day of the Christian-Democratic Union (CDU) Congress in Lipska on Monday, 14 November.
The issue of Europe's future was not originally on the programme, but it became in the autumn, especially in order to be satisfied with the members of the government's policy on the river today and perhaps tomorrow towards Italy as a salmon.
The proposal concerning the President of the European Commission, submitted by the European Commission, was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine out of 1001 delegates objected and 10 delegates abstained.
A few minutes later, Wolfgang Schäubl, a very pro-European minister of finance, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summarised in the slogan: the response to the crisis "not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not just because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
According to the chancellor in Europe, "the time of change has come."
This could be expressed by changes to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the control of the European Union over the budgetary policies of the euro area Member States, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general electoral right "to give Europe one face".
In any case, this is one of the ideas of the draft adopted by the Congress, which is clearly the inspiration of Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is unlikely that all the twenty-seven countries will agree quickly on this revolutionary step: against Britain and the leading CDU representatives, Nicolas Sarkozy, will also take the same position.
But the direction is out.
Similarly, delegates rejected a large majority of the proposal to assess the weight of each country in the representation of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of its economy, which would obviously result in strengthening the weight of Germany.
Concerned about calming the climate inside her, the Chancellor made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she did not seek to obtain a congress of "small" European states or states that are in difficulty willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal on Europe is devoted to one paragraph of the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Just not directly.
When she recalled that just two hundred years ago, there was a bloody battle in Lipska.
In fact, it was one of the most obedient defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is a fraud in the case of incapacity?
The UMP and the Government of Offensives against Incapacity are being launched following support.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 December, and will visit the Social Support Office, where he will speak on the topic of the fight against social fraud and the redistribution of solidarity since 2007.
As a follow-up to this offensive, which stems from the will to make savings in the context of increased stress, it is not less clear from the point of view of the legal presidential campaign, the legal majority wants to focus on labour incapacity.
First of all, because of budgetary savings, the government intends to impose on private sector employees the fourth day of incapacity before they start receiving support in the disease.
Clearly, without the agreement of the company, an employee who is sick would lose four days' wages, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks causing a lot of bad blood, but which Les Echos said could bring €280 million.
And also measures that would be accompanied by further measures of symbolic reach: to give public employees one day of unencumbered incapacity (to date they have no incapacity against three days in the private sector).
While these issues are the subject of discussion, the legal majority also launch the subject matter of fraud aimed at irregularities related to disability.
"The controls will be much more extensive and more: if you arrive, you will return," Xavier Bertrand warned during the interview with the RTL station provided on Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification appear to be somewhat unreasonable in view of the truth of irregularities in the workplace.
These were, in fact, the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and the political effort that brought their fruits.
The French are no more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
Let's stop at a few official numbers first.
According to the Caisse nationale d'assurance disease (CNAM - State Health Insurance) more than EUR 237 million were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Health Research and Documentation, in 2008 they presented daily compensations with their €11.3 billion 5% of healthcare expenditure.
Of this amount, 46% were related to parental contributions and labour losses and 54% were related to disability, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
So only 2.5% of health costs.
According to the Alma Consulting study, the French had an average of 14.5 days of incapacity compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
The average that conceals certain deviations: another survey published in 2007 on the work opportunities pages of Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees questioned replied that they had not chosen a day of incapacity.
Another study, this time carried out by institutions of hospital insurance, explains that in 2010, 37.8% of the unemployment rate was less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to 3 months and 11% from 11 years.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are no more than elsewhere prone to incapacity for work.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence (for health reasons or not) increased in France between 10% and 11.8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in Great Britain and 18% in the Netherlands.
Misleading in the event of incapacity for work represents only a very small part of the opposite of work in black.
As far as fraud is concerned, these are just a small amount.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic controls aimed at incapacity for work for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM found that at 1.5 million controls 13,8% of 285,000 were carried out due to short-term incapacity "unauthorized or too long", i.e. 37 050 cases.
In the case of systematicly controlled failure of more than 45 days, 11% of cases of "unadapted or unauthorized" were counted at 1.2 million, i.e. 132 000.
A total of 169 000 "unauthorized" cases for several million employees who were incapacitated.
A number that represents much less than the number expressing work in black.
According to UMP MEP Dominique Tian, the author of the June report on this issue, this figure would represent between EUR 9 and 15 billion missing in the year's tax collection, more than the total amount of daily refunds and, therefore, endlessly more than the frauds associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply the new rescue plan
Greece will need a new rescue programme to restore its economy.
On Monday, 14 December, the Prime Minister Lucas Papademos spoke before Parliament and added that the hundreds of days given to his government would not be enough to complete this task.
"In order to re-establish our economy, we need the support of our European partners and the new saving budget plan," the chief of government said when he found his first public speech on Wednesday when he started the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament.
The implementation of the decisions adopted at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, because our country's participation in the eurozone has been added to the game.
As a result, Mr Papademos assumed that the country's public deficit would be from now to the end of the year "in around 9%" of the rough domestic product after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right to reject a new economic measure
On Monday, the leader of justice, Antonis Samaras, expressed his support for the already approved measure to try to avoid the debt crisis, but noted that his party did not commit itself to any additional cost-effective measure.
"We will not raise our hand for any new measures," Samaras stressed at a meeting with the MP for his side of the New Democracy.
We have voted against the objectives of reducing deficits and debt and combating waste, but we are against any policy that would protect economic recovery.
Mr Ollim Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU are not blocking the necessary loan of EUR 8 billion without a written guarantee from all the parties that support the envisaged measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word is sufficient and that he does not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalise euthanasia and assisted suicide, experts say.
According to the report of the Royal Canadian Society, the Canadians have been denied death.
In the field of palliative care, the Commission urgently demands that governments, health care institutions and doctors work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cancer cases.
The Canadian company lives on the idea of a death row.
Only 9% of Canadians really accept the possibility of talking to their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die, and they make a decision in this regard.
This is one of the conclusions of the extensive report by the Royal Canadian Society, which involved six experts working in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This Commission recommends that the Government amend the criminal law in such a way that it allows assisted suicide and euthanasia, if this option appears necessary in a patient considered competent to take such a decision.
At the beginning of the experts are quoting a recent survey by the independent agency Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in the 40 countries of the planet.
Despite Canada's 10th place, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death".
Medicalization yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, we are informed by experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society.
And despite the desire to die in a home that most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in a hospital.
This average applies to Canada as a whole, while in the province of Quebec this figure is the highest among 86% of those who died in the hospital.
As regards the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to the conclusion that they are opposed to the position of the federal government, which has already said that the criminal law concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide does not want to change anything.
According to experts who have also undergone controls in all countries where these approaches are lawfully or are not considered criminal, there is no evidence that this decriminalisation causes any abuse in the application, i.e. euthanasia or assisted suicide of persons who are not or disagreeing.
On the contrary, Mr Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed more than a dozen cases of these seizures at a teleconference yesterday in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalised.
"Eutanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"The assisted suicide is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are prone to euthanasia
Note that according to an analysis by Angus Reid in 2010, 85% of Canadians have already expressed themselves in favour of euthanasia because they believe that it will enable people at the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that legalization of euthanasia will not mean that we are sending a message that the life of the elderly or the disabled is less expensive.
As far as those involved in assisted suicide are concerned, 41% of those questioned consider that they should not be prosecuted.
In the case of maintaining or interrupting patient care, the situation is less clear, the authors say.
They also propose in their list of recommendations that criminal law should state that the withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legitimate refusal is not punishable.
The Commission of Experts also requires that medical professionals be trained to respect the refusal of treatment at the end of their life without fear of criminal prosecution.
In the field of palliative care, the Commission urgently demands that governments, health care institutions and doctors work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cancer cases.
Finally, in the case of palliative or final calming already widely used in Canadian health facilities, the Commission requires that it be considered when it no longer serves to reduce physical pain, euthanasia and to be subject to the same procedures.
Benefits of other experts
Some experts on medical law have already expressed their reservations regarding the conclusions of the report of the Royal Canadian Society experts.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, described the position of the experts-signatories of the report as "extreme" among others because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to the sick in the final phase.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who would be tired of his life and who would have more than 18 years of age could ask to help him commit suicide," says Pierre Deschamps, who was born yesterday.
P. Deschamps also underlines that it seems as if the authors of the report built autonomy of people over all other values that create the social bias of society.
Because "in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions."
Medical Law Specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she described as "the manifestest for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Canadian Society, doubts in particular the dates of the report on the absence of doubts in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalised, i.e. in the Netherlands and in the US state of Oregon.
Jordan's king calls on President Assad to resign
The lady's talking about "compulsory"
Syria is still more isolated
Bashar al-Assad's supporters protested yesterday before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Syria was intensified by President Bashar al-Assad, who supported Russia and spoke of a "completion" against its country.
Two days after the withdrawal of Syria's membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union stepped up its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, a country neighbouring Syria, took an interest in the opinion of President Assad's departure.
Jordanian King Abdullah II was yesterday the first ruler of the Arab state to call for President Bashar al-Assad to be killed in Syria, where about forty civilians and members of the military forces of the regime were killed," he said.
"If Bashar had any interest in his country, he would have to give a demise, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," said King Jordan, a country neighbouring Syria, in an interview for BBC station.
For his part, Turkish diplomacy chief Ahmet Davutoglu has stated that the efforts of Turkish mediation under the Syrian regime undertaken since the beginning of the year have not been crowned with success.
"Those who do not live in peace with their people in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said with a protest against neighboring Syria, against which Turkey is applying the toughest line further.
The United States was pleased to see "enhancement of consensus against Assad and unfair treatment of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries like Turkey are applying the strongest tone" towards repression in Syria, Mark Toner, spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As the Syrian Human Rights Observer announced, during this time 16 civilians and 19 members of the regime were killed in the city of Deraa in southern Syria.
According to this NGO, two other civilian people were killed in the area of Homs by "shooting and concentrated shooting from heavy bullets in the city of Jobar".
However, at the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moualm's press conference, the country "was on its way out of the crisis".
He was also alive to respond to the decision of the League of Arab States to suspend Damascus membership, which he considered to be a "dangerous step".
Syria's not going to move", he added with the assurance that "the plots against Syria are not successful".
Following its decision to suspend Syria's membership, the League of Arab States is currently considering the "Citizen Protection Mechanism" and is planning to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
The French Minister of Foreign Affairs Alain Juppé is also favorably inclined to send UN observers to help protect civilians from repressive regimes that he considers to be "paranoid".
The new special meeting of the League calls for a return to Rabat tomorrow to take note of an opinion on a plan to resolve the crisis decided on 2 December and to expect, in particular, the removal of armies from the cities affected by conflict and the release of prisoners of protest.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov saw yesterday's decision of the League of Arab States as "failure", while China offered Syria to adopt a plan to resolve the crisis, but completely avoided support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti requires time and sacrifices for Italy
The next head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the markets for some time to be able to form his team and start implementing a program that will contain "victims" in order to regain the credibility lost in the last few months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner discussed with the political parties yesterday before meeting with representatives of lawyers and employees.
It should consist of a relatively narrow office composed of technocrats not belonging to the parliamentary parties.
"Monti was talking about an important programme with many victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the appointed Prime Minister.
The President of the Gianfranco Fini House expects Mario Monti to ask Parliament to express confidence by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti presenting a small team of twelve ministers to President Giorgi Napolitan.
Mario Monti commented nervously on the financial markets yesterday and asked for time.
In "democracy, precise deadlines" are valid when it comes to the preparation of the government and its programme, he stressed and added that "it is certain that markets will be patient and understanding".
Its appointment as president was initially welcomed, but concern was once again revealed after the unexpected fall in the euro area industry.
The appointed Prime Minister should make up a team involving, in particular, technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to adopt "policy".
He expressed his conviction that the new government would last until 2013, i.e. until the date of the next elections.
According to President Gianfranca Fini's photo gallery, the new government will get Parliament's confidence by Friday.
Mario Monti promised to act with extraordinary urgency and with the aim of "renewal of Italy as a strong article" of Europe.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn's spokesman stressed that "and with the new government our diagnosis of the Italian economy is not changing".
The European Union is convinced that in spite of the economic plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its objective, which is balanced in the 2013 budget, and calls for a new firm measure.
The head of the business association Confindustria Emma Marcegagli, who meets with Montim on Tuesday, focused on the need to revitalise the economy "because a country that does not show growth cannot comply with the deficit parameters".
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognised for his expertise and independence as a "professor" symbolizing, according to the authors, "the challenge to gravity" and "other Italy", is a "epochical change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism".
It'll be a great unknown time for his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy has to place state bonds by April 2012 at EUR 200 billion.
Soviet scientist helped Iran's nuclear programme
Soviet scientist Vjačeslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator for nuclear weapons, announced on Tuesday a U.S. NGO specializing in nuclear risk.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents unique from this UN agency when identifying a scientist.
Last week, MAAE reported its "serious concern" regarding the "Possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to the ISIS Institute of Wider-Talk from the MAAE by V. Danilenko (nr. 1934), he had been working for three decades since the 1960s in the Soviet Military Research Centre in Cheljabinsk, Ural, where he had been involved in the production of synthetic diamonds by means of an explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, the centre was to be abandoned to set up a company producing "nano-diamants" in Kiev.
His company's economic difficulties should have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before his return to Russia, he was then expected to cooperate with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, MAAE recalls the "clear data that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran" was based on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method well but who, as one Member State informed the Agency, worked during a substantial part of his career in this technology under the country's military nuclear programme, where it came from".
Anti-Muslim crime and crime increased by 50%
According to the FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racial and religious violence decreased or decreased slightly at the same time.
According to these figures, the total number of violence committed against Muslims rose from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49% of the increase against 13% in Catholic violence, 4% in crimes against Jews, and 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has risen very easily to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences according to the FBI.
"After the loss in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes stepped up again," the Human Rights First organization, which is concerned with human rights, stressed, "the growth of anti-Muslim violence is particularly important," the organization added in its communication.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be regarded as a serious human rights violation," says one of the leaders of Paul Legendre.
"The American government can and must do more to deal with these crimes," he adds and estimates that this could be done by improving police reports on "hate crimes".
"Hateful Crime" in American federal law is the legacy of the time of civil rights struggle.
This legal order was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish the violence associated with race, colour, religion, origin and now sexual orientation.
Twitter changes and likes more Facebook
The Twitter micro-blogging service provider introduced a change in design on Monday to allow its users to observe the activities of the followers, somewhat like her Facebook service.
New offers "activity" and "name" allow you to better and know the activity of other people who follow you or those whose responses (" tweets") you follow.
This allows you to know whether they allow you to monitor contributions, whether they are applying for new accounts, whether they have favorite contributions, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested "in August at a small percentage of users" before it was extended to the entire network on Monday, AFP spokesperson agency Twitter Carolyn Penner said.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive function, with terms somewhat incomprehensible (RT for repeated dissemination of someone else's post, follow Friday to recommend to follow another user) making the happiness of the initiatives, opens up a wider audience with a more comparable maniament to that of the networks grand public Facebook and Google+.
On the network users immediately consider the importance of this innovation in their tweets.
"It's unnecessary, it takes a lot of places and it looks too much like Facebook," says @jemb123.
"Function The activity will help me better monitor some elements of my Twitter," @dannykronstrom sent.
Austria
the entry of the gold rule on the balance of the budget into the Constitution
The Government of the Great Coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to write down a "golden rule" budget policy in the Constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid any reduction in the assessment of Austria by rating agencies (AAA).
It was the social-democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision at the conclusion of the Council of Ministers in a situation where the Austrian public debt is with its 74.6% higher than the criteria laid down by the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than the debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If the solvency of Austria was reduced by only one degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros each year on interest," argued multi-officer and foreign minister, Christian Democrat Michael Spindlegger.
Austria thus insists on the request of the Eurozone summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the Heads of State and Government have strongly requested that the reduction of public deficits and the achievement of the balance of public accounts be recorded in the Constitution or in the law of the same value by the end of 2012.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is closer to the "German model", Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, starting in 2017, the federal state's public structural deficit will not be expected to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the social countries, as well as the locals, will have to show a balanced budget.
The objective is to achieve a public debt under the 60% criterion set out in the Maastricht Treaty in the year 2020/21.
Strong Only
The node threatens new intervention in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese institutions would have to hit the foreign exchange markets again if they were to continue to strengthen.
"Let's strike, as we did last, if we find too much inconsistency" in the exchange course, explained the Senate Y. Noda.
On Tuesday, I just went back to the historical values that had forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo was only sold for dollars to reduce the value of Japanese currency, which had only recently won the dollar record valid since 1945.
But only since then has it been regularly supported by the purchases of investors who consider it a "safe port" in the worst times of the global economic slowdown and the European debt crisis.
The dollar again came under 77 yen on Tuesday, and the euro fell under a symbolic light of 105 yen close to the level that led to the last intervention.
Prior to the financial crisis in 2008-2009, it had a value of approximately 120 yen and more than 160 yen.
This increase in Japanese currencies is damaging to island exports because it exacerbates the price of Made and Japan products and reduces the value of profits obtained by Japanese companies from abroad when transferred to their domestic currency.
"Japan recovers" from the damage caused by the March earthquake and waves that devastated the Tokyo region in the north-east of the country, highlighted by Y. Noda, who fears that this incident will not only kill in the sheep of a fragile recovery.
The third economic power of the world restored growth in the third quarter (1.5% in view of the previous quarter) and this was the first time in a year due to a survey of export growth and household consumption of disaster-stricken.
But the Prime Minister determined that the high value was not merely a reflection of the national economy of Japan.
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Japanese Central Bank (BoJ), which started its political and monetary council meeting on Tuesday in order to take all possible measures leading to a weakening.
But the vice-president of this institution Hirohide Yamaguči pointed out that BoJ had already adopted "appropriate measures" indicating that no additional monetary deficits can be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Securities Emissions Institute increased its purchases of State Treasury notes by EUR 5,000 billion and increased the ceiling of the amounts devoted to the purchase of various securities to float with liquids.
Eurozone:
rates rise, storms fail
The risk of the debt crisis continues to undermine European indicators.
With the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better numbers of growth in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to grow.
The European storms, still concerned about the stability of the euro area, are falling into negative expectations on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, the CAC 40 index loses 1.4% to 3,064 points in 10 hours.
The Dax index in Frankfurt loses 0.4% and London 0.1%.
"With the new tensions surrounding the lending of the euro area states that are in difficulty, the stock markets around the world continue to generate only part of the recent profits".
"The nervous investors are just too aware of the risk of the infection," explains Terry Pratt, a broker of IG Markets, quoted by agency Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a reduction of 0.7%, which was suffering from the concerns of market participants about Europe's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
"Japan as well as the rest of the world has eyes focused on Europe and the change will only continue in a narrow corridor of variations until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilised," estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoši Investment Management.
This relaunching does not constitute a threat to the future of the euro area itself, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro is reached at the lowest level from a month and a half ago.
At 10 o'clock, the European currency has a value of $1,3570 at a 0.4% discount.
According to the brokers, the currency went down after the CDU party of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Congress adopted a proposal Monday that would provide for the possibility of leaving the euro area for countries in difficulty without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates away from the border 6%
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This morning, the yield of Italian ten-year bonds reaches 6.85% and the yield of Spanish ten-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions affecting the interest rates of the South European countries, but also in France, continue to exacerbate the concerns of market participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, strongly demanded in the market that he could remedy the situation in Italy threatened by the poison caused by the amount of her debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the implementation of the decisions adopted at the Eurozone summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is once again in a targeted market direction when elections to the parliamentary chamber take place in the country on Sunday.
The difference in rates ("spread") between the ten-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new historical peak.
Expecting euro area growth figures
Statistics say that France has recorded economic growth by 0.4% in the third quarter of the year due mainly to household consumption, i.e. slightly better than expected growth by 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies INSEE revised the number downwards for the second quarter to a decrease of 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And it's really the fourth quarter that economists worry about most.
For its part, Germany recorded growth of 0.5% during the same period.
The first estimates for the euro area as a whole are expected within 11 hours, while the European Commission has just pointed out the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
facts must overcome dogmats
If there is a subject that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term solutions or emotions, it is an energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of businesses.
It is natural for the election meeting to be an opportunity to reflect on such deposits and on a place that involves energy from the core.
The debate will only succeed if all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are explored.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic development is now triggering double electricity demand by 2050, if we don't want a significant part of the world's population to get rid of the important parts of life.
At the same time, there will have to be a lack of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity, and it cannot be forgotten that it is necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with a view to combating climate change, which is the theme that is currently missing from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident has no impact on any of these parameters.
And that's why Germany remains alone in its decision to refuse nuclear energy.
However, this is not the case in Belgium, which governs its decision to find another source capable of replacing itself, or Switzerland, which it considers to be the right building only for the last generation.
On the contrary, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue to make a decision in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to extend its park to one unit by rebuilding a one-stop power plant after the Three Mile Island power plant crash.
If a German model based on renewable energy is ever presented as an example, reality resists it.
The choice of Berlin is reflected in the price of electricity, an increased energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, a rapid increase in CO2 emissions from the construction of natural gas and coal plants.
All these unpleasant effects will be felt for months.
The case of Denmark deserves us to think about it.
The European champion in wind power plants, from which 30% of its electricity is taken, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to the irregularity of the wind, causing CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices to be 65% higher, about 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, our energy policy will pay our neighbours an electricity bill of 40% higher than the amount paid by French households.
While in the global economy, energy costs represent a key factor in competitiveness and guaranteeing the maintenance of industry in the national territory, French businesses benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would lead to a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make an illustrative beautiful declaration of the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
The price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, as they do not, in principle, oppose this energy, as public opinion polls show.
Note that energy policy has enabled our country to build a sector of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 jobs.
The strong export sector attracts large quantities of small and medium-sized specialised enterprises that cannot be transferred to foreign markets.
If France had decided to leave the core, it would have sacrificed a small number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and would have been EUR 6 billion a year, which the country earns for the export of nuclear facilities and services.
Which power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to function for 60 years while planning the collapse of its manufacturer?
When solving the energy equation, it should be admitted that there is no magical source for energy production, that there is no devilish one.
The development of low-carbon installations, nuclear installations and renewable energy installations carried out by the French industrial group AREVA testifies to the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is absolutely necessary to maintain the highest level of security.
In France, we have the State Nuclear Safety Authority, which carries out uncompromising and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new flamenville power plant.
Our teams whose professionalism is recognized have a sense of security in the blood.
In 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island has occurred under normal operating conditions and has been without human victims and consequences for the environment.
In Chernobyl the drama caused the concept of a reactor and unexplainable human error.
In the case of Fukushima, it seems that some forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that killed tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will take lessons from this accident just as it did in the past.
The fruit of this step and cooperation between the French and German nuclear safety authorities, operators and constructors is that the EPR-type reactor represents concepts capable of tackling such phenomena.
While all interested parties who wish to build a nuclear power plant consider that stopping its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to competitors in AREVA and EDF and to free up their way to strengthen their leading position in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to look for the best energy solutions for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machines control the debate so as to determine the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy implemented by Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised from different angles - the count of the police, the courts and the administration of detailed numbers policies, the compatibility of this policy with the status of "the land of human rights", which France boasts.
Recently, it was an administrative challenge, the object of which was foreign students, which became current when the Minister of Interior (see the Liberia Letter of 23 May) declared that France "does not need foreign talent, seats and maids".
But so far, it has only been re-elected at the corner of the economy.
It must be said that in this area there is quite a wide harmony between the left and the right.
Just a tone in 1976, Jacques Chirac made his statement that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country where there are 2 million immigrant workers" and on the left of Michel Rocard when he said in 1990 that France "could not accept all the misery of the world".
The only difference is the degree of greatness
In 2005, fear of the invasion of the hordes of Polish installers in French territory was shared to the right and to the left.
In both camps, immigrants are regarded as a burden for the economy and for the French company.
The only difference lies in the degree of greatness we dare to offer to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande restricts itself to banality when it states that common development will enable us to solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and the problem may be valid in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As economics Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in their recently published work synthesising the latest knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Definition Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, page 352): there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, wages and employment in the countries receiving immigrants.
Limitation of immigration protects growth and damages employment.
Concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those who are less qualified, and create pressure to reduce their wages.
But experience shows that immigrants are actually much more complementary than French employees by working in sectors where there is a shortage of employees.
Few qualified immigrants in sectors that do not belong to French employees, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where education is not available.
Positive impact on wages
Like a surgeon, there will be difficulties with work in a country where there is a shortage of anaesthesiologists, these additions between French and migrants have a positive effect on the wages and employment of French employees.
Giovanni Peri thus estimated that the growth of migration movements by 1% results in a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
However, it does not take into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributed to the creation of ideas and economic growth (the high proportion of naturalised immigrants among the American Nobel Prize holders; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
In European countries, migrants are also net contributors to social systems on average of 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that in Germany one immigrant will come to the age of 30 for his entire life to public budgets a net contribution (receiving minus expenditure) of EUR 150000.
Nicolas Sarkozy expressed his desire at the beginning of his mandate to become the missing percentage of growth "with appreciated teeth".
The teeth mentioned for the reflection of immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, European democracy remains to be contemplated
Democracy is rare and also very fragile goods.
The European continent should remember this, although it was invented in Athens two thousand years ago, during the 20th century the tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, Holocaust, gulags, as well as France in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the Colonels in Greece.
Some people could have believed that democracy would definitely triumph over its enemies, that it would be enough to make a choice and carry it out in the most direct way.
But it's already known from Napoleon that it was an ease of thought.
General election law, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can become a "trouble instrument" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, division and control of powers, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is just as it has been since the beginning of the political and democratic crisis.
The recognition of a Greek reference type yes will not have in this direction the value of a double revelation: a revelation of the necessity of a great return of political power, but also a revelation of the disturbing sense of its impossibility, its impossibility.
This ambivalentity must be thought to be overcome.
The truth is that the front line of democratic repression has moved today and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We cannot get anything if we require a number of national referendums organised according to necessity and disorganized.
White exposed to the European absolutist monarch or jump with bound legs to empty nationalist depths: what a choice for citizens!
No, we do not want guillotine knives, but a common, full-fledged, peaceful and uninterrupted exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - and we would not know where to stop - because the crisis is in Europe.
It is therefore the whole of Europe that is facing the dictatorship of markets and rating agencies that suffer from their inability and lack of solidarity.
This is the whole of Europe, which is humiliated on the international stage.
We are distraught at the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe, which slowly loses its sovereignty and with it each of its nations.
The management of the European project of democratic excellence is urgently needed.
Because only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, rid themselves of market governments and prepare for the future by investing.
The outcome of the crisis will be a European-level decision that will not be able to be taken without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise it will lead us to the graves.
After a long struggle against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today is strongly demanding the European Economic Government.
Wake up.
But think of it without stronger political and democratic integration, and living as such citizens, it would be a new madness and a new blind street.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
To create a republic in France, it was necessary to "be" Republicans.
The revolution in the interests of that could not be enough.
This lesson goes on.
We need to build a Europe that will be more economically integrated.
This can only be done by building Europe more politically democratic and true European democratic excellence.
Let us become Europeans to build Europe.
"Unplugged" chip cards are spreading
In the optimistic atmosphere it will open on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris the world shop of chips.
In 2011, according to the Eurosmart office, it is expected that an increase in world sales of cards with a microprocessor (bank card, SIM card phones) should end 11% to more than 6 billion units.
The most portable is a segment of non-contact technology that allows you to pay in bulk transport or manage purchases by just approaching a card to the reader.
This year should be sold worldwide 460 million digital cards against 320 million sold a year ago!
Their share should still rise in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and reach about 10% of the total market with chips (6,925 million cards).
After a long time in the APEC country, Europe acquires a spot in a non-contact payment.
About 26 million Visa banking cards are already equipped with this function and 75,000 payment terminals are accepted.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 visa-free cards were issued.
But big business chains work for two.
Carrefour thus issued 2.5 million pass mastercards this year.
To set up a higher rate of speed, it is necessary to equip their customers from now on.
"Two large French companies have undertaken to distribute systematically in the future to their customers a secure bank card," says Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is just the first step towards the means of payment for the future: the mobile phone.
NFC (Near Field Communication) technology is only a small number of devices available today to carry out transactions.
"They're late."
"But their real difference should come next year."
"We estimate their sales in the world for 2012 of between 80 million and 120 million units," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already getting ready.
The Bank's Agricultural Credit yesterday announced the launch of a test carried out in Caen, which will last from December to June next year.
The iPhone devices will be equipped with an extra 200 clients and employees to allow free payment.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société generale announced yesterday that he was preparing to introduce an offer allowing its customers to pay their mobile phone seamlessly.
Terrorist Front Reaches From Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links between Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-standing suspicion that there are bonds between the Al-Kajda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram is confirmed.
On Sunday, Deputy Minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria had been "unsafe" since.
"The manner in which both organisations operate, and reports of intelligence services show that there is great cooperation between them," he explained without further clarification.
It seems that Paris has similar analyses.
The investigation of the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January 2010 could help to illuminate the connecting bridges.
After the AQMI members were taken from one restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the following day at the same time as several of their abductions during the operation by special French units.
In the weeks following the attack, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several telephones with chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
Analysis of calls made leads to several people in Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), researchers are particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to the Nigerian who has long lived in Maiduguri, a town in northern Nigeria, which is a cobbled Boko Haram, and the other leads to the person who is said to be close to AQMI and the sect.
"It is progress, but there is no doubt to wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We have known for years that the sect has been enjoying external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming more active as a result," said Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, this "support" has been more and more evident in the development and performance of Boko Haram or in its operational procedures that now include human victims or increasingly complex explosive devices in the same way as those used by AQMI.
Since then, the international community in charge of Washington has developed pressure in Nigeria to consider the problem of Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities long considered the group as a community of enlightened mystics to be of little interest.
Fast success
The Boko Haram sect was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, school and fundamentalists of Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which in Haoussa means "West Education Is Sin", approves the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
Such a link in this poor region is a fast success.
The sect is politicizing and demanding strict observance of Islamic Sharia's law, while its supporters begin the fight against the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars and offices.
In 2009, the Boko Haram graduates became extremely active and attacked the police station.
The government's reaction is as usual still the same.
The army surrounds the city and the result is 800 dead.
The founder of the Mohammed Yusuf sect is captured and killed in prison.
Since then, the group has been radicalizing and leaving its seat in the north.
On Christmas 2010, he will carry out an assassination in Jos, where 80 people will be killed, followed by another in the capital of Abuja.
In June, it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram will attack the police headquarters during his first suicide attack.
And in August, the local United Nations Office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania across Nigeria to Somalia, is now worrying all security specialists.
Now, when Al-Kajda of Islamic Maghreb surrounded Mali and the game and Somalis from Al-Shabab movement operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new danger to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, in a conversation with President Goodluck, Alain Juppé said that France is in an emergency and is prepared to "preparate all information".
World According to Candidates to the President
In matters relating to China, Iran or Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are leading in simplification and ignorance.
Can America's weakened crisis manage the world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
At the hearing of the presidential candidates, voters might think so.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have repeated the holocaust statements and expert guidance on foreign policy, which is already traditionally a strong point for the Republicans.
Often unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran or help Israel flow among themselves.
Mitt Romney, the best candidate in the race for the Republican nomination "Grand Old Party", threatened the Chinese profession before the World Trade Organisation and their indictment "because of the manipulation of their currency", which is the theme of America's widespread migration of all parts of its industry towards Asia.
Worse, if this must contain the launch of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador of Obama to China, and the only candidate with some sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost shuddered at the attitude that "feels" emotions.
He called for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of President Obama).
But Huntsman, who's in the last polling stations, remains insubordinate.
To the image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if they failed to comply with the sanctions for stopping his nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll arrest Iran," fanfaron said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to increase military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in his duties to this partner.
The company Herman Cain, the second best to locate the candidate, shows a shameful ignorance of the documents.
He recently called for a sharp stand against the Chinese military threat because Beijing is "trying to develop nuclear capacities" - obviously unknown fact that China has its own nuclear weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to strike Iran, says he is ready to send an American army to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists prohibited by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and another candidate, Michele Bachmann.
Everyone is far from the Republican candidate John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy in 2008.
The opponents of the current president say Reagan also had simple ideas and yet won a cold war.
They remind us that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They stress the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the enchanted "boys" from Iraq, his excuses for Libya, and thus attributed him to a weak label.
But the attack is not easy.
The population assesses President Obama's national security policy, which removed Ben Ladin, rather positively.
Iraq has no confidence in military action leading to pollution.
And with the argument that it is necessary to rebuild America economically so that its leading position can be revitalized, Obama knocks on the right place.
Nord Stream, new port of entry for Russian gas to Europe
The remote North Stream pipeline connecting directly Eastern Europe to Russia and led by the bottom of the Baltic Sea began to function.
Must add gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas station, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the launch of the North Stream last Tuesday, a new pipeline that connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea.
Symbolically German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitrij Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte turned together to control the Russian gas supply valve into the Western European network.
This new pipeline will start to flow to Western Europe 27.5 billion additional cubic metres of Russian gas by the first pipeline of 1,224 km long connecting Petrograd region with the Mecklenburg-Pomorjana society.
The second pipeline to be completed by the end of 2012 will provide a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, which is the quantity equal to all French consumption.
And it is already recalled the possibility to build the third pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, the early completion of this huge building has the character of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries strongly protested against the project.
Nord Stream will in fact be able to deliver gas directly to Germany without being run by any third country (Poland or Ukraine).
In turn, these two countries are losing some power: the possibility of putting pressure on Russia at risk of closing its access to Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
The strongest expression was made by Warsaw when it did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet pact", with the withdrawal of the alliance between Hitler and Stalin in the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means that it is politically sensitive.
Western Europe has gained greater confidence in its purchases by supporting this Russian project.
But it is worth the price of weakening Europe's energy, because the project has created gaps between Europe from the east and the west.
Russia has barely succeeded in establishing its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries with high gas consumption, whose deposits are approaching its end.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new hub that connects us organically," said François Fillon at the celebration of the opening of this pipeline and demonstrated the point at which large gas contracts are both politically and economically.
All this explains the broad smiles of the leaders of Gazprom present in large numbers in Lubmin, the lead gas station.
The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical act.
The seabed tube is made of steel fitted with a concrete coating to protect it from the waves of seagoing vessels.
It lies at the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
During his construction, he had to avoid the mines of World War II.
"For their safety, almost a hundred had to be removed or destroyed," says Jens Müller, a spokesperson for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to impose measures to protect fauna and flora.
The tube itself is a long metal snake weighing 242 Eiffelovek, which has not been interrupted in its entire length by valves or maintenance stations.
A control panel was to be built near Sweden, but the leading project rejected it when the Swedes were only a little eager to see the Russian state company, as it was settled on their coast.
"In the event of a dispute, we will stop the flow of gas in less than 1 minute," explains Jens Müller.
In case of uncertainty, the gas contained in the pipeline will escape into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the authors because the answers were designed to cause anxiety once in 100,000 years.
The control of the external position of the pipeline shall be carried out by an underwater robot towed by a vessel while the inside of the pipeline is controlled by a device circulating inside.
This 1-metre-shaped device is inserted into the tube and is compressed with gas.
In order to complete the three-day journey at 3 m/s, it shall provide accurate information on possible metal parts distortions.
The remote gas pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without having to be less repair.
Gas circulation is simply secured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the end.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
The leading position remains in Gazprom, which holds a 51% share.
It was joined by German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunia and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies created a joint venture called Nord Stream entrusted with the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company has a residence in the city of Zoug, Switzerland, where tax is extremely advantageous.
Gazprom subsequently rented this company for a five-year contract, which can be renewed, all its gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will have a profit from total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," explains Jens Müller.
The financing of the pipeline was secured by 30% of the shareholders and by 70% of the bank loans.
The total labour costs should be €7.4 billion for both pipes.
For the GDF Suez group, investment costs amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that their costs will be reimbursed, as only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline comes from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on the sandy shore with pine forests.
The valves at a height of 4.5 meters form an exit gate of gas.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the coming gas before being transported to the German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has received one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
When full capacity is achieved, this will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - brand writer
The Italian company Moleskine, which was founded some 50 years ago, wants to re-establish the joy of writing.
It brings the smell of adventure, hours spent writing in the light of the candle.
The writer of Moleskine is easily recognizable by his black plates and his letters sent white colors as if they were old.
For the writer Moleskine, as we know him today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo living in Milan will then decide to place on the market a new design but distinguished writer.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, is included in the introduction of the new product.
The writer is inspired by the old manufacturing technique "moleskin" (skin imitation), which is used for example to adjust the surface of the spoons.
This type of writer was highly appreciated by writers and travellers.
"The Moleskine returned to the shape of an old and forgotten object that was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who since then has become the leader of the fashion brand.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales dropped by 26% to seat 12.7 million pieces last year.
The situation is remote from the first years when only 3,000 writers were created.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and exports to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to draw up an artificial portrait of the buyer, because the writer will engage businessmen as well as students or professionals.
The image of the writer Moleskine is that his owners are people of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open spirit.
A small Italian company, which initially had 12 employees, now has almost a hundred and since 2008 has two offices, one of which is in Milan and the other in New York.
She sends her writers to a bookstore and through a chain of FNAC stores to small shops in the middle of cities where she could plant her identity.
"We have followed the spirit of the times and this need for a new writing, through the stormy development of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature is accompanied by the development of the writer Moleskine: recently the brand opened the exhibition "Zacházka", where architects or artists exhibit their writer.
In August on the occasion of the film festival in Locarn, she also introduced new records of the writer recalling the leopard.
Moleskine benefits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifies its products: bags, diaries, pencils, notebooks ... The brand expands throughout the range of bearers.
The success that sparked the envy: in autumn 2006 Modo Modo was purchased by SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the proportion of unemployed people so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
Today is the 15th week for the employment of disabled people.
Through voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed people is twice as high as the average, which is 19% versus 9% for the entire population.
Is that adorable?
"No, says Eric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt Association, who organizes the Week for the Employment of the Disabled."
"The progress achieved in 15 years is remarkable."
"At that time, there was no percentage of unemployed twice, but three times higher."
"At least there's still a lot to do."
It should be said that for the unemployed, there are frequent obstacles to their entry to work.
These are older persons: 37% are over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have low qualifications: 80% do not have qualifications, and only 10,000 out of 2.3 million high school students are disabled.
And finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for disabled versus 38% on average.
In short, these are criteria that are particularly complicated to return to employment and which are "the core problem", according to Christian Grapina, Director General of the Tremplin Association, which was founded in 1992 to help businesses accept disabled workers.
So much for objective brakes.
There's still unspoken, ways of thinking that are definitely developing, but too slow.
The study conducted in April of the association IMS-Entreprerre pour la Cité found that survey managers have a "weak level of knowledge about disabled persons" with an "excessive idea of people on the wheelchair and mental or mental disabilities".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the target of 6% of disabled workers laid down in the 1987 Act.
The last known figures from 2008 indicate a status of 2.6%.
"Now we are moving around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, responsible for collecting fees from companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence is the number of "scattered" companies, as well as the amounts paid, which fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 companies to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also demonstrates true awareness, especially in large businesses."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of enterprises with between 20 and 49 employees employ disabled workers against 82% of enterprises with between 100 and 199 employees.
Gambling: "What luck"
Before Tuesday night (20h45), the French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match would bring them.
We're not going so far to write that there's a overlap between them, but the picture is symbolic.
The seats next to themselves on the stage stage of Stade de France were briefly and well Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard calmed down.
Five months after the angry gesture of his attacker in the fight against Turkey, a Belgian coach found only words of praise to his player.
"I am very happy with Eden and his progress, and the fact that he loves his country."
"I want to move forward," says a French Lille player.
As for the difference between his performance in the club and national team games," that's the same thing, it's justified."
"I've been in Lille for a year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I need to clear my badge."
Hazard, investigated against Romania on Thursday night for this fight against France, comes to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "fight".
There's no mention of the notion of "joy."
To play against Bleus, who has encouraged for 7 years and in their winning drawings in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan," he says.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" nature of this meeting.
More because "they are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," she recalls.
"We crossed immediately."
"Can play against them, it's just pleasure!"
Leekens spoke of "gloriousness" with good heart.
"Glorious" to fight "save - Christmas."
"Glorification" also found in the quality of "neighbors" that France became a very high-level team for more than a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna".
"Laurent Blanc did a huge piece of work," he sighed.
Although Belgium will miss the next European championship, a technical footballer would like to see himself in 2014 on a plane with French direction... Brazil.
"Our little Belgians will get big," he said.
"We're building something, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll realize it for the next match, including France.
Portugal very self-evident
Porto Bento's Portuguese watch launches with great optimism a strike against Bosnia (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
On the way, both teams missed realism.
"At the end of those 90 minutes we'll be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no shadow of doubt for him. Portugal's football representation, with which he's been driving since 2010, is qualified for Euro 2012.
Portugal shares luck in fact 90 minutes.
There is still one match left and one match left - Bosnia.
Aware of the Friday result (0-0) in the Bosnian Zenice hell, it seems clear that nothing has been won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour of weight, but it was not able to give him such a rare goal that he would be relieved.
"It's a good result, however, that contains the risk, because we didn't get out naked."
But at home at their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will stand before the audience, who should create a hot boiler there, even though the game definitely turns out to be "very balanced", says an optimistic but keen thinker Bento.
"We expect a very balanced match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can have a top," said a twenty-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance to be on the Euro 2012," still relativised successor Carlos Queiroze.
An indecisive Friday match in Bosnia forces Portugal to score and win.
An indecisive match can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to target.
"It's a good result, however, that contains the risk, because we didn't get out naked," says Bento.
"We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and that has players with great individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will be interested in developing the Bosnian team right from the start of maximum pressure so that "they don't have time to think."
Good idea, provided that this time it turns out to be realistic.
