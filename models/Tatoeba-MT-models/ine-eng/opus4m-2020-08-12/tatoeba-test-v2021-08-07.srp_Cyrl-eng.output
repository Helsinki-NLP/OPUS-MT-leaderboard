A man has a lot of desires that he doesn't really want to achieve, and it would be wrong to assume otherwise.He wants them to remain just desires; they have value only in his imagination; their realization would be a bitter disappointment to him. Such a desire is also the desire for eternal life. If it was fulfilled, man would become completely sick of endless life, and he would want death.
As long as a man lives, he hopes.
