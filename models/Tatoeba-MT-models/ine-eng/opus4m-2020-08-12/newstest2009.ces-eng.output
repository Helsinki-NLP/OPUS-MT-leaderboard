The Prague Stock Exchange went down to the minus at the end of the deal
After the early collapse, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected the losses.
Transactions with ČEZ shares have reached almost half of the ordinary daily trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange immediately began Tuesday’s trading on its monthly decline when it fell by almost six percent.
This time there's a fall in stock on Wall Street.
Even so, we see a market reaction as a result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, who refused to support the plan to stabilise the financial sector.
The fall in shares in Asia
The dramatic fall on Tuesday saw stock market shares in Asia, even though the indexes finally destroyed part of the loss during the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng stock exchange index recorded nearly four percent during the trade, but later part of the loss was wiped out and reduced to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which monitors the movement of Chinese stock on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, dropped by 3.8%, and the markets in Shanghai were closed.
Stocks on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but ultimately losses decreased by 4.3 percent.
The stock exchange in Taiwan has dropped by 3.6 per cent according to the black index.
"The timing of a rescue event in the United States is false and it affects the financial markets around the world," noted the head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy on its own, i.e. independent of the Chinese central bank.
The interest rates of Hong Kong are at the same level as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Ruddd, US legislators should quickly return to the negotiations and approve the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, he threatens to feel the effects of other countries.
Bloody pool of American stocks
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected a financial support plan totalling up to $700 billion (approximately CZK 12 billion).
The lawmakers thus ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the entire economy.
On Monday, American shares experienced a bloodbath and the main stock indices fell the largest in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost seven percent, and a similar decline occurred last in 1987.
The index fell before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal in the photograph had not passed, the index felt free.
Congress went down: The U.S. government can pump $700 billion into the bank
The highest representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed in a broader way to the agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system.
We'll vote for him at the beginning of next week.
US legislators broke through negotiations on the approval of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance for the US financial system amounting to $700 billion (approximately 12 billion crowns).
But it's not won yet.
Congressmen must complete some details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of the law and vote on it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on the ground of the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, Reuters, president of the Banking and Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, said that.
In the Senate, there could be a vote on the plan, according to the sources, probably on Wednesday first.
Economists believe that the adoption of a rescue plan should be the first important psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
Then, however, the complexity of the mechanisms that help markets to achieve in practice leads to "cutting".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We've made great progress.
We have resolved our different views on how the package should look like to stabilise the market," said Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat for Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still be on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met with US Finance Minister Henry Paulson on Sunday night to give a definitive form to the government fund.
It should buy from financial corporations non-sale mortgage assets that bring financial companies into serious losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are in the process of a final agreement of a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
We still need to continue in the health plan, but I think we're there," said Paulson.
Signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the stock markets that are rapidly declining.
According to the Norwegian Democratic Senator Harry Reid, the legislators are thus trying to reach a final agreement in Congress on Sunday.
They therefore want to calm down investors before trading in Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone where Congress decision could affect Monday trading.
However, it is not yet clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, nor will they be able to tie negotiations to any problem at the last moment.
Lawmakers hope it will be approved in the next few days.
The law, however, still recognizes a number of changes.
The total amount to be allocated to assist the system shall be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion should be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush called for.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amounts if it feels that the program is not fulfilling its function, following another 100 billion dollars and later the final 350 billion dollars.
Bush assessed progress in the negotiations
The President may vote in favour of this decision, but Congress may vote in favour of his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme, which was to obtain funds for the purchase of bad mortgage securities, which has been lost because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, has been preserved.
"We've worked everything out.
Photographic representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
With the progress of the negotiations, American President Bush is also pleased.
His spokesman Tony Fratto stated that Bush is pleased with Saturday's progress and appreciates the "opportunity effort to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of gold falls
The chairman of the Banking Committee of Senator Christopher Dodd, the head of the negotiator, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of savings, the timing of the financing of the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called "golden fines" for the directors of the participating companies and to set up a committee to supervise the fund.
He should run the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it and made great progress towards an agreement that will work and be useful for both the market and all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan is also calculated with the help of homeowners who have problems with pay.
The government should negotiate new payments at the mortgages it buys in order to reduce the monthly costs of payments for debtors and allow them to stay at their homes.
Mark: Psychological assistance
The proposed plan, according to the main economist Patria Finance David Mark, is a good idea, very difficult but will be realized.
"And that's because you don't know what mechanism and what price problem assets will be bought.
This will determine how the financial sector and government will share losses," said Marek for the iHNed.cz server this week.
If the plan is approved now, or at the beginning of next week, Mark's not so important.
"It is much more important for Congressmen to agree this week that they support this plan and that it will be consecrated as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on approval is now the most important," Marek stressed.
Fighting sharp knives: MP3 players against mobiles.
We'll figure out how to choose
While almost every mobile can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can phone.
That makes it clear that it's better to just buy a phone.
Still, there are plenty of reasons for a person to have his own player.
The choice depends entirely on the use and claims of the future owner.
You'll probably find it hard to get a top-priced gramophone at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
However, such music products on the LP boards do not originate and there is no objective reason for this from a qualitative point of view.
However, if you are pressed into your regalia with art rock, jazz or blues, you probably have a minimum dream about such a gramophone.
It is the same with music on the roads, i.e. music compressed, simplified - music in MP3.
There are also price and quality categories.
For someone, it may be unacceptable to lose eight thousand crowns as a player, just like Pink Floyd's fan, it'll probably be hard to test the earphone for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Decides whether or not to use batteries
Some peak music players can do a lot more than just playing music, but most phones don't happen.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to primary functions, telephone and essay, he can play music and video, both record, have a better camera, worse camera, and maybe he can navigate.
And if we take the smartphones and the communicators, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no ice cream can grill and no TV can take pictures.
The universality of the mobile also brings benefits.
The more you use your mobile functions, the sooner the indicator on the display will send you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy sharks.
A small cell phone can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, most of which is much less.
In this direction, music players (especially the simplest) are significantly more effective.
For cheap phones, therefore, count that they won't play you for more than a few hours.
If you're still here and you're calling there, get yourself into work to secure another charger - that's also true for expensive devices.
In MP3 players, you won't have this problem, and even the worst will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation at one charge.
Another problem comes when recording music on the phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices have a universal USB connector, and also not every one of them can be directly connected to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on a memory card, but only a small number of cards can be consulted without any reduction with miniature memory cards used in mobile phones.
You don't need any special software for players up to the exceptions (iPod).
Just fill in the music via USB from your computer.
Most of the mobile and players themselves are already creating a music library sorted by the name of the interpreter, album name, genre or need to be evaluated by the user.
Some devices only display the tree structure of directories like a Windows Explorer and some have both the skills (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with the operating system).
The players serve the strings, the mobiles are more skilled
When selecting a particular device, take particular care of battery strength, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output and of course the comfort of control.
If you have music on your hands and you listen to it every day only briefly in the tram, you will have enough of any cell phone that beats the MP3.
Which can really be almost any cell phone.
You don't even have to look too closely at the music formats of the cell phone or the player.
MP3 will manage all and the absolute majority of the music that will reach you will be in this format.
It is one of the largest and besides it, the vast majority of the devices can also handle music in WMA format.
AAC is less available (the format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobiles also allow for, for example, the purchase of music online.
It is enough to visit the relevant website of the operator (or other provider) and buy a song or album.
This service could already be a fall-out argument for a musical cell phone.
Unfortunately, the operator's offer is poor and limits most of it only to speedy radio hits.
Prices aren't the lowest either.
However, it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (whether through GSM, internet or wireless internet) will be controlled by the music industry in the future.
Most people's mobiles are still carrying them.
Whenever you get a taste of listening, you pick up your phone in your pocket while the MP3 player is forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you are always wearing a headphone or at least a wire free.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has almost every cell, but only a minimum MP3 player.
Probably the greatest advantage of music cell phones will be for a lot of prices.
The cheapest is usually under three thousand.
For three and four thousand crowns, you'll have a very decent walkman.
Most of you will, however, limit the absence of a normal ear.
The best and technically the most equipped phones, even with a 3.5 mm wall for a regular earphone, are worth 15 grand.
The advantage of the players is, among other things, easy service.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our choice) - player can really control everyone.
The minimum function, the similarity of control with a previously common cassette or perhaps a gramophone is obvious.
There is no threat of collision in the form of a malfunction of the mobile Internet and then of a huge data transfer account.
Which device to reach
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have slots on exchange memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy the relevant card, you'll get into two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported for basic models.
Only the most expensive ones can afford 8 GB of mercenaries.
If you already have a mobile phone and you want to buy another cheap MP3 player, please contact Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to lose more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners you prefer to reach out for specialized mobiles - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokie and Samsung).
These devices have a separate control button for MP3 and the comfort of the service is thus closer to the individual MP3 player.
It is also in the Sony Ericsson field, whose mobiles from the walkman series have identical user interfaces as a single-sold MP3 player.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery support (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), will take you MP3 players from the above marks.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Still, we're missing something here - a virtual operator that would have the classics cut it off.
Maybe she won't be missing for long.
We've written on Mobil.cz many times.
He also confirmed that the price of SMS is higher than that of the rest of the Union.
Following the last steps of the European Commission in the area of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation may arise - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lacking competition that would really want to get into battle.
Maybe it sounds paradoxical, but we have three mobile networks and penetrations over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to see the Czech market extremely competitive.
In this regard, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (CHTU) Paul Dvořák, who has said several times in the past that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic operator with its own network is not likely to have too much chance (at least he would already find it difficult to find a frequency).
But there is another option - a virtual operator.
It was just the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that brought a significant price reduction, which the classical operators had to react to.
However, before the entry of stickers like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, there were voices similar to ours in Britain.
But it turns out that there is a place for such operators and they can really be successful.
The rest of us don't have to walk too far for example.
In February of this year, we informed you about the launch of a virtual mobile operator in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator managed to get more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator.
At the same time, there is a Penta financial group behind Mobilking, which owns, among other things, U:phones in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, they need a lot less customers than a classic operator.
They do not bear relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world such virtual operators are usually profiled as low-cost operators - offering cheap calls and SMS, which is often balanced by a more narrow offer of services.
So Tesco Mobile in the United Kingdom is offering at least half of it cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a pretty good move and a bet on an unbeatable target group.
This operator is focused specifically on men.
"Administrative guys choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It's hard to say if a concept like that in Poland could catch up with us.
The press speaker Vodafon Miroslav Čepík has doubts about this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the offer of services."
In Czech Republic without a chance, mobile operators say
But it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not seem too hopeful.
It is more likely that Mobilking will be released in other countries of our region," Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, Penta’s financial group’s press spokesman, said in a telephone conversation.
In particular, she confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to this idea.
Rather, he is trying to do everything in his power to prevent any potential competitor.
In the interest of launching a virtual mobile operator, the GTS Nover group has been hiding for a long time, so it would like to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of Telephony O2 in the field of business customers.
"We are very interested in offering our customers not only solid but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly dealt with all Czech mobile operators on this option.
With some of them we have already made progress in the negotiations," says the press spokesman Paul Kaidl.
Maybe it's getting closer to better times.
Informal information suggests that we should wait for the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
For the time being, however, his origins have led to an unbreakable building of silence.
"At this point, we do not think that there is room in the Czech market for the creation of a fully-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific to other markets.
So far, no entity with a complex and serious project in this area has addressed us," he said in his statement to Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršená from the press committee Telefónika O2.
Other operators are also consulted on the specificity of the Czech market.
Press speaker T-Mobile Martin Kemr delivers in rare agreement with the statement O2: "We have not yet recorded any viable and mutually beneficial business project that could be built on."
And he adds, "In the T-Mobile network, it's hard to find a virtual operator by the end of the year.
At this point we would have to have a concrete agreement on the table so that it can be considered in this short horizon."
Vodafone contests its attention rather than to meet the requirements of its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepík says to this: "We are open to dealing with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
We think that from the point of view of customers is the most generous.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The mobile operator procedure can easily be understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to a price reduction and thus also to a reduction in profits.
Why, then, do you want to make it easier for such a competitor?
The fact that when it comes to the operators, they're going to have to pull one wire, and they're going to witness a tachany around the U.F.
Probably the biggest pressure towards ČTU went at the time of the U:phone from T-Mobile.
It bears witness to the publicly available information from the ČTU website.
But right now, U:phone fits as an argument why a virtual operator should not be allowed.
Martin Kemr said: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has also recently been strengthened by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
In view of the nature of the mobile market in the PRC, it is obvious that the entry of another player would impose high requirements on him and, above all, on his services."
As a result of this approach by mobile operators, however, it is directly affecting the full interest of the Czech regulatory authorities.
However, it is not only the attitude of the Czech Republic - unlike Britain and other advanced countries - that has no power to intervene in economic competition.
These are exclusively owned by the Competition Protection Authority (UOHS).
But he's got his typical attitude on the whole issue.
"The access of a virtual operator to the mobile market would be possible once a contract between a mobile operator and a virtual operator on the rental of the necessary infrastructure would be concluded.
No such agreement has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential stakeholders is probably not sufficiently interesting for classical operators," Christian Chalupa, of the Committee on External Relations, said in response to our question.
It is unlikely that such a statement will surprise the operators' representatives.
From the agency that is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses its position on the market, it is more than a respected one.
Especially when Kristian Chalupa adds: "In a foreign country where virtual operators usually operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile telephone services."
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the price decline is not, of course, in the interest of the ÚOHS.
In fact, the shock of the whole case is the emotional conjugation of three mobile operators resulting from their reactions.
The question is, if it's really just a coincidence, it's offered all by itself.
Just as the total price of petrol at the pumping stations is surely only by chance and a hard competition struggle.
"The Office in this matter did not look for signs of anti-competitive conduct, and therefore there is no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position, so they are not responsible for their behaviour on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market for virtual operators are probably also available to the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many issues.
There is, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTU, according to which telecommunications from the point of view of competition is the only market.
Then, of course, none of the Czech operators have a dominant position on such a market.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - the creation of a virtual operator always needs the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator -- he's totally logical -- on his network of monopolies.
So in a particular segment, it has to be dominant.
Even if we do not allow this argument, the UOHS should be minimally careful that the three mobile operators are acting in a similar manner.
However, the complaints of a number of interested parties (including GTS Novera) show that they have very similar obstacles when dealing with all operators.
The decommissioning of responsibility to ČTU is then a relatively common telecommunication trick that ÚOHS gives away from the whole matter.
We've already met with him in a few similar cases.
Regrettably, the recently adopted new telecommunications law with the extension of ČTU’s powers to the field of competition in telecommunications failed to establish, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
This must be known by the representatives of the UOHS more than well, but their interests are probably elsewhere.
That's what happens when no one sees.
At the same time, some pseudo-virtual operators that exist in Czech mobile networks remain unattended.
They are companies that issue their own mobile phone service prices, but are only partially public.
This is usually the case with a multi-level marketing company.
This is how Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their own mobile phone services.
The pricers of these companies usually only get to the chosen ones.
The magic is that the company acts towards the operator as a classic customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer then receives special prices (and other) offers.
The problem is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar resales.
"If there were cases you are talking about, it could be a violation of the contractual terms that we would deal with and could come to an end of cooperation with the company," answered Martin Kemr to our question.
It is unlikely, however, that a similar activity would not be tolerated by responsible people from mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned above, there may be thousands of customers.
None of the operators shall be prevented from doing so.
Therefore, these companies are profitable and, unlike actual virtual operators, they are not at all threatened by their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepík points out possible problems: "The law of similar speculation allows, however, the services of these companies only use a negligible percentage of customers.
Moreover, they must accept that the SIM card on their phone is not on their behalf, so they cannot fully dispose of it as normal customers of mobile operators."
That's what should be at least weird.
In addition, an additional question for ÚOHS is being opened.
If mobile operators are staring at a similar eye procedure, why are they blocking the emergence of a virtual operator?
It must be added that ÚOHS has a relatively strong power to detect a similar activity, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the operators' explanation that they do not have any such idea and their business conditions prohibit it.
When we won't be the dearest
As the text has fallen several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a significant decline in prices for services.
However, in virtually all countries where virtual operators were born, classical operators tried to defend their origin more or less.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - too small, possibly too saturated the market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, but at this very moment, regulatory authorities have been affected, not by the interests of mobile operators, but by their customers.
Whether by formal measures or by informal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator had been created and another one had been added to it.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities are overhauling the whole case as a hot potato.
From our experience, we cannot get rid of the idea that incompetence in these cases is more than appropriate.
But let's not throw the flint in the grain.
If the background information is correct and the virtual operator will appear really soon, the Czech mobile market may be shifting again.
If one of the operators has allowed a virtual mobile operator to occur, it will be difficult for the UOHS to remain inundated with the refusal (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we need to stop calling the road rather than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymna has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four implementations of the new version of the Czech State Hymna.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the Czech State Day celebrated the new recordings of the state gym where my home.
Hymnu just recorded the National Theatre Orchestra under the leadership of Jiří Bélohlávka.
There are four versions available - with a male or female solo song, in the congregational presentation and instrumentation.
The song was sung by Katerina Kržink and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the gymnastics are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krkek.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
The whitehead considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had previously told the Czech audience that he had deliberately chosen to sing the vocals of the singer with young representative voices, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning, I've been at both of them and then also with the congregation trying to make sure they have a clear dictation to understand the text well to make them laugh," he said.
The Czech State Hymna will celebrate the 175th anniversary next year.
A song Where my home sounded for the first time in 1834 on the screens of the Stavovske Theatre in the original Czech game Fidlovačka Josef Kajetan Tyla complemented with music Františk Škrup.
She gained popularity, and people spontaneously took her as their own.
The first song then became a natural part of the state hymn after the birth of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained after the emergence of the Czech Republic itself.
What's "new" hymna like?
Prague MDD for the first time on a chip
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be recorded in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date on which the first passengers will be taken to the metro, tram and buses who will have an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper cart.
At this point, he can arrange about a hundred thousand people who own an Opencard chip card.
Travelers can buy 30-day and 90-day and annual coupons (it will be paid as of 1 January 2009) and at the same time let them record on their chip card in the infocentres and workshops of the Transport Company in the metro stations Museum, Bridge, Hallesovice, Angel, Roztyly, Latvians, Kobylisy, Rajska Gardens, Kačerov and Luka.
Coupons can also be purchased on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
The service was used by over four hundred customers in the afternoon.
Those who start using the Internet can definitely forget about the exit window in the subway stations where they had to regularly be in long fronts on paper carts.
The coupon buys over the internet and is recorded on an Opencard card in one of the 13 branches of the City Library.
"In these places there is a travel agency available with a trained service that will help interested people with Internet purchases and also record on their card the coupon purchased," spokesperson for project Martin Opatrný said.
Along with the books, you will be able to record electronic coupons on Opencard also in self-service machines, which are installed in several vestibules of meters.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, they remind the riders of the rides and the travelers may have already noticed them at the stations of Roztyly, Budjejovicá, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," the Guardian added.
The coupon checks the driver's position automatically
The service of the machines that start working tomorrow is simple.
It is enough to insert an Opencard chip card into them and the previously paid coupon will be recorded on it itself.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow are payable not only in the capital, but also in its vicinity.
In other words, in suburban trains and bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, which are driven to the main city mainly residents of central Czech municipalities.
"In the trains included in Prague's integrated transport, the guides are equipped with karet readings to determine the time and band validity of the coupons," explained Filip Drápal of the Ropid organisation, which consists of the Prague collective transport driving order.
The buses have a car parked in the driver's vault.
It is therefore necessary not only to show the driver a chip card at the time of the show, but also to add Opencard to the designated place on the side of the treasure.
By doing so, the driver checks the validity of the coupons recorded.
"If the traveller needs to verify the validity of the coupons filed, there is nothing easier than to ask drivers for this information," Drápal added.
Travelers who do not travel by bus and do not remember when the coupon expires may return to self-service machines where coupons are recorded on the card.
They will have information on the validity of their documents on the display of the device.
The judges wanted to vote for the US referendum
In 1945, the Germans applied for membership of the United States of America.
It comes from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South American Scientific Library.
If we can't be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the auspices of the United States.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudets turned to the president of the United States in 1945.
This comes from, among other things, a letter that was kept in a private archive and is stored today in the collections of the Jihočeska scientific library.
In a letter from the President of the United States, the Germans from the Czech Krumlov ask that he not allow the return of the "shumbush" - prohibited by Hitler on the basis of the Munich agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have correctly understood the situation and we really want to make sure that American units come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," says the letter, signed by the words "People whose destiny lies at the heart of the forest."
As the accession to Czechoslovakia gives allegedly Sudet Germans - in knowledge of the Czech national character - hope only of brutality, indifference, misunderstandings, oppression and slavery, the authors ask the American President to take over the protection of the present and eternal times.
"We cannot believe that regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would admit this territory to a foreign country that impresses and repels minorities and nothing, nothing has contributed to the victory of the United Nations," the letter says.
The reason why the authors can't sign is apparently a fear of the vindictiveness of the Czech oppressors.
If the President of the United States allegedly doubted the opinion of the Germans, it would be enough for him to hold a referendum in the forest parish on whether its inhabitants wanted to be part of the United States or living under the auspices of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naive in today's knowledge of war stories, according to some memoirs, it adequately illustrates the expectations of the Sudanese Germans.
Although the common Germans had to at least think that it would be their withdrawal from the Republic, only a few of them allowed such a possibility at all.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudettes.
Others believed they'd just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in the Czech Budjejovices.
He was a war like a wartime German who was set up to sail in the Baltics.
When the British arrested him at the end of the war and put him in a prison camp in Holštinsk, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach him Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home, the Czech would throw them away," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia believed that they would withdraw from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
You don't mean - you'll pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action aimed at road safety in Czech history.
Even so, it would be possible to characterize the emotional media campaign that it intends to launch on Wednesday the Ministry of Transport.
The Office of Minister Aleše Ribíčka promises to remove drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, movies, on the Internet, as well as on flights.
She should get the driver off the fast drive and the alcohol behind the wheel.
And also remind them to join before they leave.
He wants to reach young drivers, motorists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what happens in the spots?
Especially human stories that attack emotions.
And it also bears witness to the "blood" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't mean - you'll pay!
The word "you don't think" is written in large letters on the page.
And then in the bloodstream is the word "pay."
It should symbolize that a person can pay for his life in a moment of neglect.
The audience will "fear" the spots until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in England, where images with drastic images of the victims of accidents can usually be seen.
He promises to reduce the accident and the number of dead people on Czech roads.
Spots have been prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and driver’s whip
"The driver pays the sugar and whipping system.
Sugar for them is that if they go to red, for example, they save time.
The scourge is a threat of punishment or accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk," says transport psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Kořán.
And that's why there's a need for an information campaign in the press and most of the negative advertising, the psychologist's missing.
He says that less effective are the tables that alert drivers to danger.
"If a static table warning against danger is installed, it is likely that it will soon comply with the environment and that drivers will not devote themselves to it," Kořán warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The President of the Interim Israeli Government, Ehud Olmert, spoke for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, namely pre-Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in a conversation that the newspaper Jediot Achronot published on Monday.
"We need to reach agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, unless at all," said Olmert's journal.
"We will leave a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (Israeli territory) because without it there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that any return would include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and in particular does not want the tractors or bulldozers to cross his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in an attack on two July attacks in a city where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mountain, sacred and historical places", which lies within the Old City.
"He who wants to maintain Israel's sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won't work," he went on.
Departure from Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke of Israel's departure from the Golan heights, which is, according to him, an unimaginable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria only on the basis of departure from Golan," he warned.
"Syrians well know what they're going to have to give up in order to get the Golans.
They will have to give up their current relationship to Iran; they will have to give up their relationship to (Shit movement) Hizballáh; they will have to give up the permanent support they provide to terrorism (Shit movement) to Hamas, (Terrorist networks) Al-Qaeda and jihad (holy wars) in Iraq," the prime minister said.
Questions about the accident: Are the stewards in the bus illegal?
The law is unknown, walking on a remote bus doesn't have to
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency near the Italian Padua, a question arose as to whether stewards and passengers could travel by bus.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, it is the activity of the steward in opposition to the road traffic law," says Karel Hanzelk's spokesperson for transport.
The accident in which a 20 - year - old steward died last week was likely caused by a truck driver who crossed the road by bus.
At the time of the accident, the girl was sitting next to the driver, at the least safest place in the car, even though she had two more seats.
However, the bus may crash, or quickly freeze, even at a time when the Stewart spreads coffee or paper.
The role is whether the bus is equipped with parking space according to the technical certificate.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must sit.
The Student Agency's remote buses do not have the place to stay; as the director of Radim Janchura confirmed.
"This was done with the ministry and the movement of passengers was not allowed at first.
Afterwards, we withdrew and we reached the point that passengers may go for a ride to the toilet if they have their seat," he told his opinion.
The law of Stewart is unknown
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of stewards - no legal legislation is solving this role.
However, no legislation prohibits the provision of services to the carrier.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term of the guide vehicle; it does not define its rights and obligations," says the Hanzelka spokesperson less clearly.
On the contrary, the Director of the Road Traffic Management Committee of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorny believes that the problem is adequately addressed.
"It depends whether the bus in the approval has an approved parking space.
It's over," he says.
Buses are divided into urban areas where parking places are and limited maximum speed, inter-urban with parking places with higher permitted speed and without parking places with maximum permitted speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, says the expert
The expert BESIP on transport safety Jaroslav Horín in the movement of stewards on the bus board is not seeing a major problem.
"When you drive a lot of danger, the situation can be compared to the service in the aircraft.
It's not even safe here when turbulence comes and the plane can fall into the head."
"If, however, the bus would be quick to frown, of course, physical laws apply.
Just like on a city bus or a tram.
The security of the Stewarts must be addressed by the transporter by internal regulations," he says, and he also says, from the point of view of the law, the problem is unresolved.
Janchura is willing to cancel the service
A student agency offers steward services as the only bus carrier.
He employs two hundred of them.
The Director does not consider their profession to be a risk even after an accident.
"But as soon as I realize it's a risk steward's job, I'll cancel it.
Coffee and newspapers can get passengers at the entrance.
It would also save costs," he says.
As an interest in safety, the director of Asiana Alexey Litvin, who operates a break of lines compared to SA, justified the absence of stewards in his cars.
"We don't have stewards, we've been standing against it since the beginning.
Sooner or later, it will end some fatal damage," he said a few years ago for the Week.cz.
An Unrestful Tragedy Happened
In the accident of a link to Naples, a young steward from Plzeňska died, who worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian truck is likely to turn off without using the remote route and block the bus.
His driver tried to avoid a quick maneuver, but he got the right front.
That it would be sold out two seats reserved for the rest of the Stewarts, Janchura refuses.
"This place can't be booked by remote connections, it's blocked."
The company is going to sue the driver of the truck.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency won't wait for the court's verdict, but the financial compensation is also expected from the culprit.
Amendment of the law?
Inadvertently
The clarification of the movement of stewards on board the bus could bring about the amendment of the law to which a 30-year expert group of the Ministry of Transport has been working over the year.
"But no specific conclusion has come to it.
Buses don't even solve too much, rather point system, maximum road speed and mobile use when driving," says an expert at Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of stewards to be something that would in principle endanger the safety of passengers," Hanzelka, a spokesman, concludes that control of the safety of buses is under the authority of the police and the safety authorities.
The hope of Düsseldorf is Frankfurt
The main words in the letter from WestLB to the employees of this bank are not missing.
The merger of the units of this Düsseldorf monetary institution with the Frankfurt Deca-Bank will create "the central financial group institutions which are eligible for trade in capital markets", we will consider in a letter to the public on Monday.
According to the letter to this transaction, WestLB shall enter "a set of competences" that ensures long-term yield.
Such a connection can, indeed, be a decisive impetus for further mergers in the banking sector.
Such texts arise when a representative wants to demonstrate his ability to act during a difficult time.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Commission but also on the part of the General Office for the Supervision of Financial Services, whose communication to the national government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
The connection between the Deca-Bank, which customers are familiar with for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever it may be, has been talking for a longer time - even on the Frankfurt side.
Chief of Deka-Bank Franz Waas heard at the end of August that in the merger of his bank house in Mainzer Landstraße with some of the Landbanks, such as Helaba or WestLB, there was no sense.
However, the Deca-Bank Governing Council, which is composed of one half of the Land Bank and one half of the Bank's affiliated, entrusted the representation by conducting discussions with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be business on the capital market or part of it.
However, the talks have just begun, and the finance is being undermined.
The Deka-Bank, which is one of the most important employees in the financial market in Frankfurt with its 3000 employees, is not the first to talk about consolidation in the sporadic sector.
In 2003, it seemed that the merger of Deka-Bank with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helab could occur.
There was nothing out of this three-piece.
Shortly after the merger plans became public, the Hessen government spoke out against the participation of Helaba.
Neither of the remaining banking houses have joined.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz received Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart instead.
Even so, speculations about the connection of Deca-Bank with the Land Banks have been repeated.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, chairman of the Helab Bank's representation, said negatively about speculation about the connection of his financial house with others.
It seems, however, that regardless of this, it is clear that the approximation of the various banking houses of the public sector is necessary.
Now after the elections to the country's film in Bavaria, BayernLB could be the first to break down the connection with Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
That's not exactly good news for Helab.
If the pressure is to increase to further mergers, the potential partners for such mergers will gradually emerge.
Only the second hub in the south would play even though the financial crisis has so far been significantly better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
Hessen-Thüringen, which has a 50 per cent share in Helaba, has banned connection with WestLB again at the beginning of the year.
That's what Nord LB would look like.
But geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how much trade models of individual institutions are being used together.
In June Merl announced that the crucial question, which business model should ensure the future competitiveness of the Land Banks, the German association of creditors and the jury banks had not yet answered.
Everything could also end with WestLB, which, of course, nobody wants in this institution.
This is why the letter from the House of Commons also speaks of trying to "complex solutions" for the entire banking house.
Whether and how it can be connected to connecting individual files to the Deca-Bank will show time.
The second weekend of October is known as "weekend with Italy"
It's the first time for Elena, for Luca's third or fourth.
But this time Elena will be like his girlfriend, and then everything will be different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-litre court of the Kaiser brand, is a stronger belt and two hundred tourists on Octoberfest prove how deep tones can release his throat.
Elena Lucu will dance first and then kiss him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus park next to the station of Puerto Nuova, four buses will leave this evening at 23.45 with the name "destinazione Monaco, Festa della Birra", expected arrival 6.30.
Three buses cover mainly the Italians, in one bus they drive exclusively to Brazil.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans sing with their flag, they already celebrated at night.
And so out loud, says Marco Guard, it's nothing for Italy.
Mark, who's wearing a long coat with a leather tie and glasses with large silver rings, belongs to the three buses.
For five years he's been driving them to Octoberfest, only this year he has three trips.
In the night, during the day between bars with beer, at 22.30 go back.
Overnighting would only mean unnecessary costs, says Marco.
The road is worth 75 euros, including Kaiser beer, cooked according to the Bavarian law on the purity of beer, health insurance and German-speaking guide - Marco went to Frankfurt for a language course.
Buses leave in the night, after the bus stop heading for "Brenner."
Beer doesn't give up, not yet.
The bus shuts fast, the traveler sleeps.
They're doing well, they'll still need their powers.
It is built in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where on the highway number 8 pieces before Munich makes another stop and many other buses with an Italian flag.
When Mark's group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese in the middle of the seventh morning, there are about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are together, Marco has his last speech, explains the plan of the attack.
First: Put on a yellow hat.
On the left is written "Octoberfest", next to Marc's internet address travel office: "conoccersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the door is opened to the beer stand, run!" Marco calls in the morning air.
"Run!" Run and place the seats in the back of the estate.
"Not in advance, so that you don't cross, and not all yellow hats on the same bench, move around the space!"
My husband's worth 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the propriety.
"Show the Securites we're acting right.
As soon as you leave your homes, they will be gone."
Third, "to-night exactly mid-twelfth, be here again!" Do you understand?
And up to Wiesn, a space with beer states.
On the way one member of the group hangs yellow hats as marks on trees, cedars and even on the election poster of one large Bavarian side.
We need to prepare for the retreat.
As "weekend with Italy" is known for the second weekend of October.
No accurate information is available on the number of visitors; it is about fifty thousand who are on their way through the Alps and enter beer states, ten percent of all visitors arrived from Italy this week.
A number of Munich police force forces seven police officers from southern Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which conducts national statistics in which the Italians before Britain (about 60 attacks) and Rakušana (about 80) with approximately 200 medical treatments contain the first place.
He's particularly popular with the Italians' Stan Hofbräu.
Unforgettable Nights for Hypo Real Estate Creditors
Last week, Peer Steinbrück, the social finance minister, stressed that the German banking system was relatively stable.
It is good that this policy has used the word "relatively" and has also been influenced by the fact that the German banking sector will not remain in crisis development.
Because last weekend he was born.
The Dax index, a financial house specialising in the financing of the properties of Hypo Real Estate (HRE), will receive several billion loans from the German bank consortium to protect against market turbulence.
The person who reported the situation on Monday told Reuters that the said credit aid would amount to up to EUR 35 billion.
The benefits will have to be paid by Hypo Real Estate (HRE) only from the amount actually exhausted.
Money probably comes from private and public banks.
In the background are the losses of Depfa's subsidiary.
According to the press report, this state financial officer has re-financed long-term projects that he has borrowed in an extremely short period of time, which is no longer possible due to market mistrust.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserve dropped by 95 % to EUR 2.37 million, and the share of equity decreased slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
Current earnings and net earnings from financial transactions against last year have fallen to zero, revenues from the increased value of loans and certain securities and also from the cancellation of credit trading reserves have fallen by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
Only by way of higher profits from the subsequent calculation costs of the restructuring of the former Depfa group and of the return on interest under the tax regime and through trade between the companies concerned was the 16 % reduction on the part of the profit and loss.
The former state financier, after privatization in 1990, burned on mortgages for businessmen who were then excluded from the portfolio of services and then run Aareal Bank.
As classical state funding earned too little, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects of private investors and the state (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and was diversified internationally.
From the value of its subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate now has to write down something and these write-offs will have a "essential material effect" on the calculation of the profits and losses of the entire group, as some have certainly been able to hear.
The fact is, there won't be a dividend.
By 2007 two thirds had already been cut short.
Hypo Real Estate has since Depfa was taken over as a major finance officer of state and infrastructure projects.
More strongly than any other institution depends on refinancing on the interbank market because it does not have any deposits of customers.
After the fall of the US Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the origins of interbank loans were practically out of line, because banks were careful about liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing funds annually for part of the Depfa credit portfolio - about 50 billion euros.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group's financial needs are covered by this loan for the period in question and the company is protected "from the influence of international monetary markets at the moment to a significant extent of inability".
Other sources have been heard that this money ensures refinancing by the end of 2009.
On the contrary, HRE Georg Funke's representative stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to use monetary markets at the time.
The Bank and the Financial Services Supervisory Board (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group on the market is now ensured.
That's what the shareholders and the bank's creditors are hoping for.
But given the dynamics and inefficiency of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely excluded that the loan should not be fully exhausted.
However, it cannot be excluded.
After the bank is late Sunday afternoon, according to everything before insolvency, it can't, even if it's premature, save the holiday.
The stock price dropped by 75 per cent to EUR 3.30.
On the contrary, bonds courses were well held.
While the preference debt has not moved in practice, it loses the course of other bonds more significantly.
This concerns, in particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary of Württemberg Hypo and the logical bonds with the period of validity after 2009.
The Hypo-Real-Estate bond initially appeared as an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability needs to be understood after a significant exacerbation of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself that introduced it into the company by taking over Depfa, depending on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the issuing banks, governments and less affected trading banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to calculate the amount of securities in their maturity.
But it can also come to what is now almost no one is losing hope - the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, given the reports coming at the same time as this partial statement, only legitimate hopes are now likely to be bordered.
This, in particular, will likely prepare long - term believers for a number of awake nights when they will decide whether to give up their commitments.
Short-term investors may use the threshold order at least to create a transfer of losses from previous accounting periods to future year's rate of return for the purpose of payment of capital gains tax.
Sylvana and secret of the bento box
When sixteen-year-old Sylvan Hiltrop's first day of high school in Tacibana, girls begin to brag: the German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from the manger. On his new blog, she will tell about Japan.
"The first day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I've been pushed from my way to school.
I live on the border of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to the middle of Taciban.
I had to find my own way. Luckily, I didn't lose.
It seems that the beginning of the teaching in Tacibana is not given as strictly as at our home in Lower Saska.
The students will start meeting after eight hours and twenty minutes before the ninth starts a short session with the teacher, so called 'home room'.
But before I started studying, I had to introduce myself.
I'm not the type of person who likes to talk to people, but 40 students.
Because I haven't had my school uniform yet, I've got my host mother's old dress on me, to that blouse, blue skirts and black leather shoes.
So I put myself in front of the fence and tried to say everything right: 'Saiónara Wo šeš Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvan, I come from Germany, and I have a week's birthday.
At that point, I was so glad that I started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class were hushing, chichotting and having, and I've always heard the word 'kawaii'.
I already knew that from my manger.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls needed for survival and means 'sweet, sweet'.
Then I quickly entered my place.
The girl next to me laughed a lot, thought she was honored to have a foreign student sitting next to her.
The rest of the hour was relatively quiet, but when the gang called, I was literally asleep.
They talked through each other and chichotals and asked me if it was possible and impossible - and yet it is very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then, about the break, they all packed their bones.
My hostess mom also made me such a lunch box - and it's something other than boring German candles.
I had rice with vegetables, small pairs of vegetables, a salad of onions and rice, fruits and some fish in a tofu pasta.
Most of the time, I don't even know what's eating here in Japan.
These things look special and taste quite new.
Of course everything's really good.
Well, I guess I'll go to the salty sweatshirts, no!
Benta at Japanese schools isn't just lunch.
Sometimes a girl will give the boy a specially prepared bento, which in this case is especially artisticly adjusted, and hope that the boy will know more about the stopover at the festival.
That's what I read in my comic book.
I'm wondering if I can see it here, too.
'Why exactly?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said,
'Cause it just fascinates me.'
I've been reading manga for years.
And to understand these comics and their culture better, I started learning Japanese once.
So it was quite clear to me that I would have to come here once.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs, and habits.
And you're highly appreciated here.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
Even the rats have feelings
When a rat or a stork flees from danger, does that mean they also feel afraid?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals have feelings.
But how can they be sure that they feel the same way when they behave like us?
For several years, contributions from well-known scientists have been published in the magazine Edge.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in his series presents the selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without you being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove it until now, if we can't even prove that the consciousness has other people.
But in this case we can at least hope because all human brains have a consistent basic configuration.
However, once we start to dedicate ourselves to another species and open up the questions of perception or generally consciously, we enter the inaccessible terrain because hardware does not match.
When the rat gets in danger, he will do the same as many other animals: he will pretend to be dead, showered or attacked.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists judge comparable subjective experiences.
I don't believe that, though.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it easier to transfer our subjective life to animals.
This is because, however, the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its share in short-term memory and executive or managerial functions).
This vast area is developed in man far more than in other primates, and it seems to be missing in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness, which depend on the prefrontal cortex, among them the knowledge we have, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is even different from other primitives.
Another dramatic peculiarity could hide a person's language: because much of his perception is associated with the language, it is often said that consciousness depends on him.
In this case, we could exclude animals.
But even if the knowledge of the language did not matter, the language would certainly influence it, so the animal consciousness, whatever it is already built, would probably be different from most of the state of our consciousness.
So it's hard to figure out what it looks like to be aware of other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, it is not possible to measure or measure, because of special hardware, to analyze on the basis of our own experience, its research is making us face major problems.
Most of my extracts relate to the content of conscious living, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be scientifically accessible.
Animal awareness processes could be examined regardless of their content, and this is exactly what is happening in short-term memory studies in primates, especially for example visualization.
But this approach devoted to Christof Koch and Francis Crick focuses on the neural corals of consciousness rather than causative mechanisms: they can both be identical, but they may not be.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of a non-frontier cortex for visualisation.
What does it mean to feel?
I export them from the fact that the emotional system, such as the fear system, is activated in the brain consciously of its own activities.
So what we call "fear" is a mental state in which we are when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) uses operational memory.
It is seen from this angle that feelings are closely linked to those areas of cortex that are characterized by primacy, and especially by people.
In connection with language nature there is a slight deviation of perception, because we can distinguish and categorize states by using words and grammar to attribute them to others.
For example, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in cortex areas and the brain family devoted to body feelings, like Jaak Pankseep, which, however, focuses more on the brain tribe.
Since this network has not changed in the course of human evolution, it could easily share the feelings of many animal species.
I can't literally resist it, but I think it's unproveable.
Pankseep argues that what happens to us at the cross and people appear to be fear is likely to feel the same way: How is it possible to verify, says Panxeep, whether the rats and people feel the same when they behave similarly?
Is he afraid of danger?
From my point of view, the mere similarity of behaviour cannot prove the compatibility of living.
It is true that the neural comparison moves us further: the rats and people have similar brain strains, unlike the fungus and the brain.
But is he responsible for the feelings of the brain tribe?
And even if it was possible to prove it with a man, how would we want to prove it with a rat?
I think that rats and other mammals, perhaps even cocksuckers (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are probably fundamentally different from those of us (because human consciousness depends on special surroundings and on language), I'd rather study emotional behavior than emotional perception of the cross.
Anyway, in this case we can wait for progress at the neural level if we measure the same for the rat and for the people.
Just like I don't check my tongue and my conscience, I don't even check my feelings, but I don't know if they exist.
It's possible to think it's short-lived, but I'd rather go ahead than throw myself against the wall again.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
President UEFA Platinum: Period of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said preparations will soon be run directly by the President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise ME together with Poland," Vasjunyk said.
"For our country, it's not amnesty.
The work has just begun, and there is still much to do in both countries."
In the timely implementation of the schedule of construction or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airport, both hosts are crashing.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for ME is reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work as fast as possible," said the president of the Ukrainian alliance Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA will be watching us all the time."
Even more radical steps have been taken in Poland.
The Polish Association of PZPN was revoked by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by Robert Zawlock, an independent manager.
The Committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Mirosław Drzewiecký.
There is "a serious danger that PZPN will not be able to act in accordance with the rules," the Polish PAP Press Agency Drzewieck said.
"UEFA President Michel Platini's letter assures us that this step will not result in preparation for ME 2012."
Several teams from the first league were sentenced only in the last season for manipulations to forced downfall, and finally had to be even speeded up to move the beginning of the league.
Stunning Dennis Quaid's back hit
She wanted to make an ad to a new movie, she was talking about private things - and now she's having problems with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan was talking about her former Dennis Quaid as a marriage breaker.
He's going back and forth.
The late war rose at the former Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid's marriage pair: seven years after the divorce together, these two Hollywood actors are leading a bad fight - in front of public sights.
Meg Ryan said last week in a U.S. magazine interview: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
I think she learned about the extent of the deception until after the divorce.
The motivation for this mental stripping was the PR work of Ryan for her new film "The Women" - the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his presentation as an unbelieving husband was significant: "He's crazy," said a forty-forty-year-old actor in the New York Daily News, "Meg oversteps the history of our relationship and adjusts it."
Moreover, it's "police-worthy," that to a common sixteen-year-old son Jack again "publicly recalls the pain and radical changes that are a divorce for every child."
While Ryan lives alone since the divorce, Quaid is married again and recently has become the father of twins.
His thoughts about the movement end up like this: "My life goes on anyway.
I think I'm happy to have a wonderful family that's doing great."
Prices for flights and hotels decrease
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, the years under one current study were even cheaper to 50 percent.
Flights and accommodation in hotels have been reduced again - this is the result of a study by the American Express travel and financial service providers.
The company analysed its data on the reservations made in the first half of 2008 and found their significant decrease in the second quarter following the price rise in the first quarter.
After several years of price growth on the hotel market, accommodation in many places has already been reduced.
From January to March, prices rose in 41 of the 48 European cities monitored on average by 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than in the previous year.
This trend in Paris and Rome was most noticeable, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
The reason for this trend is that American Express considers a weak dollar price, which has led to the "decreasing taste of American tourists to travel".
The lower prices of hotels were also more severely affected by financial centres than industrial centres, such as Hannover, Kolín nad Rýn or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, the prices of hotels increased by 26.3 per cent even recorded a European record.
Air fares also showed a downward trend in the first quarter:
Because of Kerosin's invasion, passengers in the class of Economy had to pay on average 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, up to 29.2 per cent for heavy-duty long-duty fuel.
From April to June, the prices of the aircraft in the class Economy fell by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, but in the classes Business and First-Class, the changes in knowledge were less significant.
In Germany prices have fallen even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, 11.9 per cent grew, 23.6 per cent fell in the second quarter.
In the German national years according to the study quoted, prices even fell by half.
One of the reasons for this price drop is slowing economic growth, the company explains.
The demand in many segments of the air transport market is not real.
On the other hand, there is an increased competitive pressure due to the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalised air traffic between the US and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the disruption of non-profit lines for air carriers and also the high number of airlines that announced a competition in the first half of 2008 - it was only 24 airlines in Europe.
HSV defeated Gladbach 1:1
Thanks to one barrier and simple methods, Hamburger SV gets to the front of the table.
In Borusia, Luhukay is still unable to build a functioning 11th.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - to increase the unsuccessful landing for the representative of Marco Marina.
This gladbach player got into the game late and didn't hit the ball on the dot.
His report was precisely formulated and delivered out of his mouth convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," observed Hermann Rieger in the hall of the Hamburg arena.
The catacombs didn't do much, the break between half-times ended, and most people sat in their seats again.
Rieger was a physical therapist of HSV for nearly three decades and was more respected than a lot of instantaneous actors.
And so his request was also heard in the responsible place.
Coach Cornelius Jol drew up and raised his finger on the sign of the match.
Cornelius is the brother of coach Hamburg Martin Jola.
His command must have sounded the same: I'm here with the other goal!
It didn't work out.
"It didn't look good here today," Marcel Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have been "desiring more relaxed."
For 1:0 (1:0) Hamburgen thanks to Mladen Petrić's head (11) and the circumstances that the very weak Hungers couldn't harm the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
This Monday, Hamburger SV will celebrate 121 years of its existence.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the vividly updated table on the video wall, in which their team was mentioned as a premier.
It's going to be a birthday without a proper party.
"We know how to evaluate it," said Marcel Jansen.
He thinks that the current table result symbolises the league's incompetence rather than the dominant HSV.
The team with the late arrival of the new players - the Brazilians Nevese and Silva, the barbarian Petriće and the FC Bayern won by Jansen - is slowly located, but can't shine yet.
"We need more sense and more dribling," Jol said.
After the defeat of the vote
Fear spreads on Wall Street.
The first reports on the melting of the rescue package led to a decrease of Dow Jones index of up to 700 points.
That was the biggest point loss within one day of his history.
Dow picked something up later.
About 20.30 showed this world's most important stock exchange barometer a 5% discount on 10,579 units.
The technological stock exchange Nasdaq was with more than seven percent less than 1548 points.
The worst was in Dowu at this moment American Express, who lost almost 14 percent, and the Bank of America loses about 12 percent.
None of the titles could strengthen.
Goldman Sachs' stock loss almost ten percent.
A few days ago, Warren Buffett, a major investor, was involved in this company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds should be made available for the purchase of so-called damaged mortgages.
However, the full amount is not to be repaid back, but in several stages.
The remuneration should be to obtain a list of options for financial companies that could be paid in favour of the course, thereby reducing the burden on the public budget.
Action courses in Europe are falling sharply
Billiard aid to banks in Europe and the US investors is not free of doubt.
The stock price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is highly variable and is downloading Dax index with it.
The American Dow Jones index also loses through the planned rescue of the state financial market.
Spectacular price losses Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank dropped the index of German shares (Dax) deep into the minus.
The stock of the said Munich financial property lost even through the rescue of the public government and private banks up to three quarters of its value, Commerzbank lost more than 20 per cent.
Dax clearly closed below the psychologically important 6000 points and with a negative 3.7 percent scored 5,839 points.
All over the world, the stock markets went to their knees.
In New York, he started a business day on Wall Street with significant losses.
Investors are afraid that the US government's $700 billion life-saving package would not have to be enough to revive events on financial markets.
Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 per cent during the first hour of trading, so it's 10 809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives should vote on a rescue plan, the Senate could express itself on 1 October.
Other European storms also met in one direction: in London, the FTSE index was first weakened by 3.2 per cent, the CAC-40 in Paris lost 2.9 per cent.
In Asia, the Japanese leading index of Nikkia fell by 1.26 per cent at 11,743.61 units.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell by 2.1 per cent to 18 286.90 points.
In India, the leading Sensex 506.43 point lost 3.9 per cent and trade ended at 12 595.75.
In the MDAX, they lost after the announcement of an increase in the share capital of Arcandor.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has described 23 million new shares.
In addition, the business and tourist group announced that the shares in Thomas Cook would not be sold.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years scientists have not known how to deal with one mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver (gravitational prak).
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity should not be entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" flew through the universe.
It's because of fuel management that's gonna freeze soon, she's now threatening to die in the winter.
One mysterious phenomenon has been confusing among scientists for years - anomaly of gravitational powder.
Gravitational practice is an aerial maneuver of space probes, where they gain additional mobility in the gravitational field of some space body, such as the Earth.
That's why the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
What scientists have said for years in this case is that flying bodies do not behave as much as a person would expect under the old good gravitational law.
On the contrary, there is an irregularity in speed.
The probes are speeding up or slowing down.
So far, the physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
He was baptized by anomaly of gravitational washing.
Several experts fear that even the general theory of the relativity of Albert Einstein, which describes the attractiveness of the material by bending the space, should not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton is still convinced that Einstein was not wrong, and attempts to explain the anomaly of gravity through so-called dark matter, whose presence in the universe was discovered by astronomers.
"The responsibility for this anomaly could be a dark matter that could also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
Space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It is obviously a gravitational force whose effect on the other universe bodies can be observed.
On the contrary, it is completely invisible, which means it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, not even visible light.
Scientists estimate that this dark matter is a good five-fold mass of the universe.
In Egypt, the kidnapping of tourists is free
After ten days in the hands of their abductions, according to the Italian Foreign Minister, the abduction of tourists back into Egypt is reported.
The kidnappings from Sudan demanded a ransom of several million euros.
Six kidnappings were reportedly killed before the shooting.
Five Germans were taken south of Egypt.
The ransom deal's already under way.
The Germans have repeatedly become the target of kidnappings.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourist attractions in the Sahara are, according to all, free.
They informed the Egyptian state television, the Arab Al-Arabia television station and the Italian media accordingly.
Italian Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release of Sky TG 24, according to reports from the Italian television station: "Our fellow citizens and other stakeholders were released.
We're just checking their health status," Frattini said.
According to the report of Egyptian state television, there are five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, and also eight Egyptian leaders in order and security.
All 19 participants of the expedition to the desert are already on their way to Cairo.
Indistinct remains the background of the shooting before the release of the hostages: according to the Egyptian security officer, kidnappings were prepared to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army suddenly killed six kidnappings.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with the ransom," the quoted employee said.
It's just that it's just a matter of taking over, when all of a sudden this surprise came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt shot six kidnappings, and two of them were arrested.
The kidnappings claimed six million euros for Germany; the German wife had to hand over the money to one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" with an appeal to one of the German mediators stated that the release of the hostages was spreading because the kidnappings were afraid of their safety.
According to this report, abortions were intended to be passed on to the woman’s owner after the payment of the ransom.
Men were to be kept until kidnappings had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this report.
Abuse by fathers "leaded to suicide"
A few years of abuse by the father led a woman to kill herself, sounded before the court.
After admitting eight cases of sexual harassment, seventy-seven-year-old Michael Treris from Styrians in Cornwall was sentenced to six years.
The Crown Court in Truro heard that he had his own daughter Stephanie Randle regularly tied up when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," Treris wrote in a confession.
The court was also told that Ms. Randle was killed at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived as a child in Coventry, Trerise bound her eyes and then sexually abused her while her mother worked in the house.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the '80s and returned to Cornwall.
His own daughter went to Plymouth.
However, it was heard before the court that Ms. Randle, who spent much of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust organization, was following a pattern of abuse that had been committed twice a week.
Ms. Randle's friends, who were also very devoted to surfing and cycling, said that she was "emotionally dead" and that she was "surrendered to life" in 2006.
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
She's supposed to have drowned in a needle bag.
Randle stood face to face with his own father, his daughter, who wrote a confession that ended with the words: "I tied her up and tied her eyes.
"I didn't abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen Treris told her: "You are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been awful for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends by taking the victim's life.
Even more terrible is the fact that if she didn't do so, it would probably not have happened to the court."
"In particular, I would like to stress the consequences that Stephanie's parents have had for your crime against their daughter in those years," he added.
"I guess she'd probably be a promising, successful and happy young woman."
The official who lost the data will be charged
The BBC found out that a government official who had kept strictly secret documents on the train in June would be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two strictly secret documents on the waterloo train at the time he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defence.
The documents were received by BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the least serious obstacle to the above-mentioned law and does not imply any criminal intent.
BBC correspondent for defence matters Frank Gardner said that such a move would be surprising for many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought that the matter was being handled internally between the ministry and the Government's Office," he said.
An employee who is not entitled to be appointed shall be charged under section 8.1 of the law in question, which is a clause which deals with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended to the Metropolitan Police Officer that he complain on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work on the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he forgot included the secret analyses of Al-Qaeda and the possibility of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed about the decision on Monday morning and moved from home to an unknown place.
Liabilities to the debt of B&B
British social assets may have to settle with more than 80 million pounds after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley.
The government has provided EUR 14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million clients in Bradford & Bingley.
The benefits of this loan will be paid by all companies that take customer deposits, including 59 corporate foundations.
The Director General of the Association of Social Foundations (BSA) Adrian Coles said he is "subverting", that the funds and their members have to pay.
The 14 billion debt will finally be repaid by saving Bradford & Bingley mortgages.
However, the interest that is set in the meantime will be paid every year by all 700 financial corporations that take customer deposits.
The Fund's Monetary Services Plan for BBC confirmed that all 59 social foundations are included in this heading.
It is reassuring that these institutions, which have behaved considerately... must now pay some of the accounts of those institutions which have not been so considerate.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company should pay proportionally to the deposits it held and that the stocks should pay around 18 % of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that debt interest will increase by 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means they're gonna have to find 81 million pounds to pay interest from the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Association of Societies, told BBC that he was convinced that it was unfair.
"It is humiliating that the institutions that have been polite during the spread of the housing market must now pay some of the accounts of those institutions which have not been so considerate."
According to the BSA, no deposits have fallen since 1945, when they appeared.
"We will have to look into all aspects of this over the next few weeks to see what opportunities are available to protect social assets and their members from account that might be significant," Cole added.
The order applicable in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010, interest will be paid throughout the year and this could be almost twice that.
In view of the fact that the shareholdings are non-participants, this account will ultimately be payable to their members at higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk contains five pence per litre
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
Ms. Jersey has announced that from Monday, she will increase the wholesale price of her milk by five pence per litre.
It's already the second price increase this year, after a two-penny raid in February, and comes after the research carried out by the consulting company.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they want to reflect the event at customer prices.
Before the fall, the wholesale price of Jersey's milk was last changed in 2002.
Caucasian for Bangladeshi expremirator rejected
The Bangladeshi court rejected the application by former Prime Minister Shah Hasina Vadzid for bail, which means that if he returns to power, he can be arrested.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to release her for bail in connection with the charge that she had obtained a claim from a certain businessman over fifty million such ($729,700) when she was a prime minister.
The case is one of several corruption charges against her.
Chalda Zijja, a long-standing political rival of Shah Hasina, was released earlier this month for bail.
Shah Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh for the next few weeks, but her party, the League of Leagues (Awami League), has asked the local army to give her full freedom first.
Writers say that while she was allowed to enter a foreign medical procedure, it is not clear whether she will remain at liberty until she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say that the Supreme Court's regulation is now being appealed to the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court has rejected Shich Hasina's application for bail because he doesn't need bail when he's already under investigation abroad for an honest declaration," said her defender Rafique-ul Huq.
"We appeal against the Supreme Court's regulation."
Her lawyers claimed she needed bail in order to return from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
The High Representative of the League of People said that Shah Hasina was due to return home after 17 October.
She was detained last year after the army held by the temporary government took over, but she was released from prison in June so that she could go abroad for medical treatment.
Shah Hasina and Cháilida Zijje both reject all charges brought against themselves.
Fear of anti-refoulement in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, almost 200,000 children have not participated in a recent widespread attack against the Taliban-related violence.
Last week, the United Nations conducted a survey in six provinces.
However, it says that for safety reasons it was not possible to reach children in the south in the parts of Helmand and Kandahar.
The UN spokesperson stated that this happened despite the Taliban's promise that it would not attack or defend thousands of probation workers at work.
BSkyB lost court case on ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal dispute over the review of the Commission’s decision on competition, which has ordered companies to reduce their share in the ITV’s competitive broadcasting.
The Board of Appeal ordered BSkyB to reduce its share of ITV by 17,9 % below 7,5 %.
The Commission had previously stated that BSkyB’s share was infrequently competitive and has had disproportionate influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought a share in 2006 in a trade that has prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trade announced that the acquisition of an ITV share in BSkyB raised doubts about the independence of ITV and called on the Commission to initiate an investigation.
The head of the Virginia Consortium Sir Richard Branson, consumer organization and regulator Ofcom were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its share in ITV was unreasonable and as a solution disproportionate - especially because BSkyB had previously said that she was willing to give up her voting rights.
New investigation of the case of American lawyers
The U.S. Chief State Representative appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine American lawyers in 2006.
Tah came into the situation when the report on the affair, drawn up by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Justice, criticised the activities of government officials.
The report criticised the officials of the White House, the legislator and former Minister of Justice Albert Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by the fear that lawyers were removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials interviewed during the investigation lied to the investigators in order to dream of justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine stated in the report: "A serious description including potential criminal proceedings has not been fully investigated or explained."
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to speak was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the US Ministry of Justice released nine American lawyers in December 2006.
At that time, the Ministry stated that lawyers had been released because of poor performance.
Later, however, it turned out that the release of lawyers was not considered worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to conclude that the release was politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers were involved in the complaint of high-ranking Republican MPs and senators, others refused to investigate charges of fraud against the Democrats.
U.S. lawyers are investigating and conducting lawsuits in court cases for the government.
They may be released at any time, but they must not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Minister Alberto Gonzales, was burned for release and finally resigned.
The number of other representatives of the Ministry of Justice has also declined.
The Inspector General's report on Gonzales's role in the affair was very critical, saying that he was "mainly responsible" for the release that he "abdicated" from his leading position and that in the event he "was not very committed".
Other officials, including former High Bush adviser Karl Rove, were criticised for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf's Command will be evaluated
The Rock Star Meat Loaf will get one of the Q Awards prizes for its epic hymn Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer who will come to the ceremony next weekend in London for his special gold prize said he was "honored" with the recognition he received.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title composition of the 1977 hit album Meat Loaf.
This year's appointment is run by the Coldplay group, which has reached the narrowest selection in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of the Q Magazine, said: "There are some songs that stand above things such as time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed the big vocals that met Loaf provided.
It started with an instrumental part that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in Britain in 1979 as a single and reached its 15th place.
But Meat Loaf's Bat Out Of Hell album was held in the barn for about nine years and sold it all over the world more than forty million copies.
Meat Loaf - the real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, in 2003 he was also operated because of irregular heart rhythm after he crashed on the stage.
In 2007, he was forced to cancel the concerts by the acute laryngitis.
Later it turned out he had a voice cyst.
Insect street, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of roads, streets, motorways and other land communications, some famous, others only useful.
But also many veteran taxi drivers and long-term locals have trouble finding Extra Place, mostly because they've never heard of it.
This small street is in the district of East Village and leads north from First Street - without getting to Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
At a width of about ten and a length of 40 meters, it is more like an empty passage than a transport trail.
There are no street signs.
It's practically invisible in the ordinary atlas.
However, he has an admirer's street.
For example, Avalon Bay, a developer of recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
Extra Place wants to resuscitate and create a cleaner transition to shops and boutiques that are to be opened in new buildings.
Other admirers are the long-lasting neighbors who say they were cut off by street charm just because it was one of the last remnants of the time before the block was destroyed.
However, the City Authority for the Protection and Development of a Building, which has a street in its power, has no interest in keeping it.
At the meeting of the Land Committee of the General Community, representatives of the City Office and Avalon Bay planned a plan to buy a street developer.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, the Community's regional manager 3, the Committee prefers to have the option of staying in the city's hands and has requested a new plan to be submitted next month.
"The city already owns only very few land, and we would like Extra Place to remain in its possession," she said.
"There could be proposals for reform and administration, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public access."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that she wanted to reschedule a small street and sit down the seats for a few of which she would use the café, which the developer expects to rent.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, the speaker of Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it doesn't necessarily want to own it.
"The main purpose of Avalon Bay is to fix this abandoned street and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said and added that the sale proposed the city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for the building, said that the city actually wanted to sell the street, and suggested that the task of its office was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to his more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a mark in history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802 when the large Philip Minthorna farm was divided between several of his children and no one made a claim on that narrow track of the country.
In the Extra Place, the rear door of CBGB, a punkrock monument that closed in 2006, and the street is perhaps the most famous as the background of the photo on the album package of Ramones "Rocket to Russia".
"The place was wonderful," says Danny Fields, Ramones' manager, who took a photo in November 1976.
"There were waste, scraped clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, sheets and pipes."
Some locals, including bloggers, who write about the rape of the East Village district, are opposed to the idea of selling Extra Place and claim that that piece of public property, whether vital, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place a rarity - almost unchanged part of the city that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog on behalf of Jeremiah's missing New York (with the title "The Book of Tools: A Grieving Nostalgic View of the City in the Remediation Process"), hung up part of the story about Extra Place from the book Talking About the City, which appeared in The New Yorker Newspapers in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow blind street, dark and in the day and limited by the sharp iron doors of the warehouses and locked windows, where the old newspaper runs through the bars for a week."
Except for a few exceptions, the street of one recent evening looked exactly the same.
Krysa ran across the blind end of the street near the door that once led to the CBGB, where today's expensive clothing trade is taking place.
There were graffiti on the walls and there was an empty bottle of beer next to the fresh dose of the thrown news.
A couple of passersby said they were thinking about Extra Place a little bit, but they suggested that some kind of rebellion could happen to him.
On the contrary, Fields said that they think some people underestimate the impact of the street in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in the dark, wet and resistant places."
Bilingualism debate: subduction into English
In this edition, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss the position of candidates for bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an academic from California and Director of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Better Than You Think: Why High Schools Need to Choose Schools".
Effectively referring to Hispanic voters is an ominous matter.
The educational agenda of Barack Obama just proves it.
Obama's campaign points out that "African-American and Spanish students are significantly less likely to study than white students," which is the truth.
To combat such performance differences, Obama's educational agenda promotes, inter alia, "transitional bilingual education" for those who are only learning English.
The question of Barack Obama remains, however, whether his commitment to bilingual education, which places emphasis on the use of languages other than English in class, is not more powerful than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Take, for example, the Sixth Street Prep, a charter primary school in the eastern part of Los Angeles.
The students of this school are in the absolute majority of cases Hispanic from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom had just recently arrived, are only learning English.
Even so, in the 2008 national math tests, the highest percentage of students in the fourth grade reached an incredible level.
Nearly the equally amazing ninety-three percent of the fourth-class students were reached at the highest level in the English language and literature state tests.
This incredible success has been achieved by a different method than Obama prefers.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and exercise, constant assessment of skills and access without excuses.
Furthermore, and Obama should notice, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the pedagogical school approach for those who are only learning English is "full immersion".
The English subjugation highlights the almost basic use of English in teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who is against bilingual education, said to me, "We had a tremendous success with one completely new disciple from Mexico - after twelve months you would enter the class and not know what it is."
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take the Sixth Street Prep school as an example of how other schools with large shares of Spanish and English students should look?
The results achieved by the school should be self-evident from the answer to this question, but the educational agenda of its own party (National Education Association is a long-term supporter of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education undermines Obama’s prediction of the answer.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized things when he declared that people should stop worrying about "English" laws.
Instead, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wants to erase the performance differences, he should think carefully about the educational patterns that work, rather than make fun of them and trivialize them.
Oil is falling rapidly due to renewed economic concerns
The oil prices on Monday fell sharply because of the fear that the US plan to save financial markets would not have to revive the economy.
Prices of fixed-term oil trade fell in the early trading of the New York Commodity Exchange by up to 7 per cent to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, the price has dropped by more than $20 per barrel.
In the last two weeks, the markets with comets have been shaken by financial unrest on Wall Street and also by two strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, this month the price fell almost to $90 per barrel, which again jumped to the huge uncertainties of the financial markets.
The concern was rekindled by the investors on Monday, even after the Congressional Presidency announced that the weekend had reached agreement on the biggest rescue plan in history.
This report was accompanied by fresh fears that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the latest episode of the divorce procedure, the government announced that the Citigroup would buy the Banking Department of the Watchvia Corporation.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially set up the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts of Barclays Capital said that a heated weekend meeting leading to a plan to save the economy " turned out to be unable to revive the mood on the market".
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
"The outlooks for global stock markets, interest rates and exchange rates have been strongly discouraged," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in the investor report.
"We assume that the Commodities will not be able to escape the plague.
From a comfortable perspective, our biggest concern is to what extent the American virus spreads to the world and especially to China."
The analysts of this bank have reduced their expectations for the following year, as oil consumption has fallen due to slow economic growth and have reduced their forecast of gas prices for 2009 by around 20%.
Wild ride in the second quarter beat the record team
After spending the last eight seasons in Jets dress more than anyone else, the defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen everything.
Then on Sunday he watched the development of the second quarter in which Jets turned the free game into a sleepy ride.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after Jets and Arizona Cardinals made their own miserable game equal to the dark clouds above them.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranuese College to the twelve-yard touchdown sprint, which perfectly marked the afternoon in which their progressive cooperation moved thousands of miles ahead.
Favre sent Colise to this quarter behind two other touchdowns, including the one where the cornererback fell, and another 10 seconds before the half match.
"It was nothing extraordinary," Favre said about all his plays to Coles.
"He's a damn good player.
We've had a great time communicating, whatever people think."
While Favre and Cole were hazelling, the defense attacked the Cardinals Kurt Warner quarterback.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught a stray watch and returned it 32 yards to the touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith tapped another tape and caught it.
Linebacker David Bowens brought Warner to the pool.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens won, was perhaps the best.
Team Cardinals got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after Jets got the ball back, they dug Jay Feely's 20-yard goal out of the field, so he won the 34-0 lead.
That's the most thing Jets ever got in one quarter.
Watch Jets Eric Mangini when he was called to describe the madness, he said, "The second quarter, or the third quarter?"
When he was told that both - Jets allowed 21 points without an answer in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can tell you that the second quarter I enjoyed much more than the third.
A lot of points fell in a short period of time."
Retired Gebreselassie has improved his world record
Haile Gebreselassie from Ethiopia again showed why many consider him the best distance runner at all when on Sunday in the Berlin Marathon he won his own world record and became the first person to run 26.2 miles of race under two hours and four minutes.
The victory on the pleasantly flat track at 2:03:59 changed by 27 seconds his previous time at 2:04:26, which ran last year in Berlin.
Gebreselassie, 35, created the 26th world record of his career, which is truly incredibly wide - overcomes the world record or is at least the master of the world at all distances from the metric mile after the marathon.
Last month, Gebreselasia skipped the Olympic marathon in Beijing, because he was afraid - from a look back perhaps to too scared - that the polluted air would upset his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - the sun and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the target - he won on Sunday Gebreselasia with a bright average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
What the track runners like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya focused on the longer track fell the marathon record in the last decade in more than two minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselassie told reporters that he had a flight break two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
The break was obviously more of a wake-up call than a hold-up call.
"I'm so happy," Gebreelasie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago and I was a little in doubt today, but everything was fine."
He was also criticised - mainly in Kenya, the East African rival Ethiopia - for planning his races excessively, generally avoiding the world marathons, relying on guides, as if it were a race on the road, and building world records on the meaning of competition.
But this criticism can be difficult to reduce Gebreelasia's enormous running quality.
Held at the pace of four Kenyans reached Gebreselasia half at 1:02:04.
After the leaders left, two elite Kwambai and Charles Kamathi raced for Gebreelassie.
About something earlier than three miles before the goal of Gebreselassie last took and fled Kwambai, who then reached second place at 2:05:36 and thus improved his personal maximum by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third at 2:07:48.
The women's race ended in the excellent year of the seventh fastest time of history 2:19:19 Irina Mikiténk, a parent from Kazakhstan who is now a citizen of Germany.
Record time 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
Twenty-six-year-old Mikitenko suddenly won last spring in the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
The Beijing Games dropped out of something described as a back injury, but she recovered and won in Berlin and in the third marathon she ever ran improved her personal maximum by almost five minutes.
The race ran smartly and thoughtfully: she let four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners run into a big jump and then reached them after about 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia ran second at 2:21:31 and Helen Kiprop from Kenya ended the third at 2:25:01.
Pride and obstacles to the lives of black people in a separate city
Hidden among the diverse entertainment parks of the larger Orlanda, several miles from all lighty, noisy and curved, lies a quiet city in which the pride and the stress of African American life resonates.
Eatonville, the first completely black town to be part of the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as it was described in 1935: "a town of five lakes, three croquets, three hundred ugly hides, three hundred good swimmers, a supply of cows, two schools and no prisons."
Now it's a bus stop.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Eatonville festival Zora! to present a gift to Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains a party, although she stopped it for tourists by including it in the Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project since the economic crisis.
It's still as independent, dignified and private as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that foreign black people in Florida often resisted and didn't share their real feelings with a white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't even know what's coming about."
Even today, in a year when the black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open debate on race, many left-wing residents remain attentive to the views of foreigners.
"We pay close attention to how our story is told," says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lives here from birth and is a member of the oldest parishioner in the city.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and power.
It is both a historical model of Montenegro's uprising and a community of nearly 2,400 people, where the poverty rate is double against the nationwide average.
It is a centre of literature, but also a cloudy example of southern rural black culture - sometimes desecrated, sometimes desecrated - that came from American slavery.
It's not too surprising that the people here are both proud and protective.
And the concerns about Eatonville's performance really started with Zoro, which is the only way Hurston's name is.
She presented her home city to the world through the heart books full of titles like "Mules and Men (Muly and Men)" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God (their eyes followed God)" (1937).
The five paragraphs of the Florida tourist guide changed the city of pieces to road No. 17, which leads through the often overlooked centre of Florida, into the period of Montenegro's history and the human drama.
With the release of a large drum in life and literature, Hurston led readers to the shop of the first Eatonville mayor Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
"To the left next to the road," she wrote, "is a white nest decorated modern national school with well-maintained halls and playgrounds that Howard Miller always olds about, even though he can't read much."
She also mentioned the new husband of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever fits into the hour hotel."
So in just a few hundred words Hurston Eatonville connected with self-government, but also with illiteracy, the reintroduction of abortions and sex.
This obviously wasn't a typical Fodor's truck.
In fact, it wasn't a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Zora said as it was," says ninety-nine-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls who made Hurston immortal by quoting men who sang free songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
Hurston is still remembered as a chipper who often returned after her family moved to the Florida Jacksonville.
Augustus Franklin recalls that most of the time, when she arrived in the city, she came without notice in the huge Chevrolett, smoked and wore pants in a city that is proud of decent clothing today.
Most of the people were fascinated, said Franklin, but a lot of people were complaining.
"The people of Zoru always liked to see," Franklin said.
But, he added, he jumps on his chair on the back terrace with a view to Lake Sabeli, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were cut off from the press.
It seemed like Eatonville forgot about it together with the rest of the world.
Although she was once a literary star, contemporary Langstone Hughes, and the only blacksmith at Barnard College in the 20th century, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Florida Fort Pierce, where she lived before.
In Eatonville, there was no greater mourning ceremony or public reading.
"I think they didn't understand her meaning for the world, nor did they understand her reference at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's biography "Wrapped in Rainbows" published in 2003.
The change came in the 1980s.
The representatives of Orange County wanted to extend a five-way highway to the city instead of Kennedy Boulevard, which is a local two-way main road.
Orlanda discharge has already pushed Interstate Highway No. 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still getting out of a complicated historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950 ’ s, he brought the struggle for interracial hatred to the heart of the community.
"At that time, a party of white guys, they came and threw oranges and things on the people who sat on the side," Franklin said.
"We actually had one lady here who killed it.
They were walking out of a melon's car."
In a 1955 newspaper, The Orlando Sentinel questioned Hurston's demand for the highest court for forced integration and declared its decision in Brown's case against the Education Chamber that "it is more offensive to my race than it is to celebrate."
The residents now claim that school degregation, although in some areas positive, has reduced consistency in Eatonville and undermined the courage of young people.
"Black children were used to hug - I remember - you hugged your teacher in the morning, hugged your teacher in the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Elly Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group Preserve the Eatonville Community.
It lasted until teachers and disciples came from the same place, added.
"You don't include your white teacher, because your white teacher - I mean, there's a cultural barrier," said Miss Nathiri.
Civil rights, however, helped to create space for many other Zory Neale Hurston - black writers, artists and artists who, like her, have risen above prejudices with light-minded self-awareness and quotes such as "How can one resist the taste of my presence!
I don't get it."
In 1975, Alice Walker arrived at the unmarked tomb of Hurston and began to fight for her reputation.
Five years later, Hurston’s famous biography from Robert E. Hemenway came to the bookstores and reintroduced it into the U.S. Cannon.
The project with the motorway arrived just as the most famous daughter of Eatonville once again found the light of the ramp.
The former neighbors of Hurston now considered her a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a Hurston festival to show what could happen to destroy its highway.
Thousands of fans arrived for the opening ceremony two years later, and each ice is returned to the festival.
After a few years, the state withdrew from the road plan.
"These five streams of highways have risen, you would say it was a direct fire, real civil pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd said it more simply, "The Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project helped to change the image of the city.
Other places like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to attend the right church in 1993, began to appear in a larger number, and the residents began to reassess the past.
Eatonville joined the national historical register in 1998.
The new single-story library (called of course after Hurston) was opened in 2006 to the newly opened and decorated Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: only six miles from the center of Orlanda can sometimes act as a bustling street in the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1980s.
(90% black today.)
With strangers who come to look for the story and meaning of Eatonville, it is still often treated with caution.
Permission for most conversations must be given in advance and certain things - such as wall paintings in the oldest eatonville church, painted by whites and shown by blacks in the fields - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Jones, a brave, self - confident teacher who likes the red net, are still afraid that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And as Hurston's festival grew, so did domestic pride.
In particular, young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with problems and so on, but not better, not worse and as proud, creative, industrious, funny and diverse as other American races and ethnics.
From the voice of Franklin's son, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, he's truly in love with the local people when he plans to return to Eatonville after high school to work in the local government or at the police that he says he would enjoy some help.
And even younger, like eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Kenonov, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they just go through here, will think, 'Hm, this city is nothing against the others,' said Alondra Kenon recently on Sunday after the church.
"But if you really stop and look for a moment in history, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York we're all talking financially
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from news stations and busted television images on Times Square, they wouldn't know they were standing in the middle of the storm.
They would never decide that in the honeybees the office over their heads has every day bankers and managers of investment funds that monopolies New York, the worst "bad day in the office" since the 1929 crisis.
The ambassadors still count the metal carriages after the walkers and transfer the muffin bakers to the breakfast meeting.
Hispanics are still moving between the towers and wearing, like human mules, fifty frozen shirts hanging from the scales on their backs.
The office crates are still waiting in front of their morning baggage at the street dining stations, and it is still not possible to reach every day of the yellow taxi between the fourth and seventh afternoons.
It didn't seem like a crisis at all until, with all the words about pessimism, I decided to set up a savings account Thursday afternoon.
Even though I was on time to hide with the late afternoon siesta at my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, there were about 20 people waiting on the front.
Not before the treasure windows to pick up or save cash, but before the overcrowding where senior customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for a way to trade with mixed Macy's goods and new customers set up accounts.
Most of the people in front of me, as I learned from Starra, my "licensed personal banker", came from the same reason I did.
However, they have already chosen their savings from smaller banks in places where they have come, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Staten Island.
They have chosen money from so-called trifts (a little like construction contractors), cash companies and from those types of brokers whose branches operate only in one state, and who claim to care for their customers as a family.
Last year, 15 such banks broke down.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion assets, turned into a competition, and when New Yorkers returned home for the weekend Friday evening, another bank, Watchvia, with $440 billion assets, tried to catch a rescue buyer.
The officers of the office and the shops that stood in front of me and were afraid of another collapse moved their cash to a bank, which is considered a safe port and which is doing most of the rescue on Wall Street.
In the last week, the ordinary New Yorkers learned full financial skills.
Some woman in my local Chinese supermarket spoke on the phone and spoke to Lehman Borthers, the corrupting bank, and her late top executive worker Dick Full with a familylike attitude like she was worried about a lazy colleague.
And Lynn, a uniformed about 50-year-old housewife of my chin, changed the subject of our usual conversation - Brad, Angelina or my food delivery.
After I visited the bank, she said, "I now have my savings in money market funds.
I moved it, I'm not going to risk it."
The Muslim Graves Desecrated after the Afro-Causian Lawbreak
Heinz-Christian Strache, left, from the Austrian Legal Party of the Free and Filip Dewinter from the Belgian Legal Party Vlaams Belang is presenting the event in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008, "Citys Against Islamism".
They bear signs similar to transport marks that show mixtures crossed by the red line.
The police accuse legal extremists of desecrating the Muslim cemetery in Austria for the same weekend, in which the right-wing parties have achieved enormous profits in general elections.
Over 90 graveyards in the town of Traun near Linza were sometimes destroyed between Friday evenings and this morning it was hard, and the police are convinced that it was an organized event.
The culprits scoffed at some Jewish symbols such as David’s star, but the detectives are convinced that it could be an attempt to mask the motives of the extremists led by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It's not clear whether this incident has been linked to the elections.
The right-wing Islamic communities said they were "deeply shocked" by reports of the desecration that came when the Muslim post-month Ramadan was nearing its end.
In the meantime, Austria is entering a search engine for its own soul after traffic broke out in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
Both sides of the right, which have obtained more than 30 per cent of the votes, the Free Party and the Swaz for the future of Austria, have conducted a very anti-migration campaign and some of their slogans have been criticised as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Terrore, president of the Free Party, who won more than 18 per cent of the votes, protested in the campaign against dress and beards, and even expressed his resistance to the foods in which the relationship to Islam is perceived.
At the last meeting with the voters in Vienna, he spoke of "European brotherhood", which is intended to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to prevent the construction of mixtures and minerals and are arguing that they are political symbols of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The research and analysis carried out immediately after the elections, which placed the most powerful political bloc in the country, indicate that this change has been caused primarily by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed to travel abroad
Gary Glitter, a glamorous star who was convicted of sexual abuse of children, ordered the court to travel to France and Spain.
The officials announced this six-month ban on Glitter after informing the monitoring authorities that he is planning to travel across France to Spain.
This travel ban was approved last Thursday after giving the officials evidence of Glitter's past judgments on sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, his own name is Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Supreme Criminal Court in Kent, but was represented by lawyers from Corker Binning.
The Judicial Service said: "On Thursday 25 September at the Ashford Supreme Criminal Court, the Kent police asked for a regulation that would prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from crossing the border to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd didn't personally participate."
64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad, saving him a record in the register of sexual assaulters.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also report the planned date of departure to the police a week before.
If an obligation to inform the authorities was mentioned, it could be sentenced to five years.
The Kent police have announced that they will not discuss individual cases of Glitter's possible routes after the period.
The Kentian police said: "The Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to follow someone who will stay in Britain because we have extensive systems that manage the potential risks more effectively.
Protecting the people of Kent is the highest priority for the Kent police, and we are working closely to monitor the behavior of registered sexual assaulters in order to minimize any risk to the public at least."
Glitter returned to Britain last month after he spent 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of two girls at the age of 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to fly to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and he refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities didn't let him pass the passport check, and he finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials continued his return to Britain.
On 22 August, he finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and stayed there, while his legal representative David Corker went to Uxbridge's lowest criminal court in Western London and at the same time successfully requested an order to register as a sexual attacker.
Glitter was formerly imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months for the possession of child pornography.
A source from the interior ministry said that Jacqui Smith, the interior minister, is calm and happy that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"To capture the real character, I take a picture of the master outside the scene." Günther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no calls, no costumes.
Only the essence of the great Flamenca masters, separated from the focus on interpretation - that's how I aim at the relaxed expression of a man or a woman.
On the one hand, an artist.
Second, man.
Unresolved, if we mention privacy, in those moments away from the public - then we can see a secret gesture, a deep glare of caught sight or a passionate gesture of hands that are carefree, because they are not going to perform on the scene.
Germany's Günther Bauer shares the theatre performance with singers, dancers and guitarists with the less famous faces of the champions.
With this aim, the photographer compiles a unique iconography of flamenco from different environments.
The exhibition, which takes place within the framework of the Flamenca Monthly Photography Program (Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca), "reflects the ever-growing international significance of Flamenca", says the author and explains that "Flemenco-people" can be any people, but when you look at the photograph, you will find that these are not typical images of artists on the scene.
These portrait people "on the street" are artists capable of conveying passion, sorrow, joy... and totally captivating the spectators.
To capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to take pictures on stage.
He's wearing his personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the great flamenco.
The "Cante de las Minas" festival was opened in 1997 by Bauer, a long way to portray flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers on a disc camera.
These are portraits that remind you of classic photography thanks to the choice of camera and material.
The use of different stylistic means is contrary to the classic basis of the image and lends it the current spirit, which is the idea that, according to Bauer himself, sees the flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, but it doesn't stop to surprise and develop."
What cuts viewers is not the effect of the dance itself, the song or the game, but the personality and nature of the artist.
Looking for the moment when we meet with the most important, with the spirit that appears in the way of perception, being and living, it was and is a constant work presented during these days in the El Fotomat gallery.
This selection of almost seventy photographers creates famous flamenco characters such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyosová, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales or Vicente Amigo.
The project became like a flamenco anthology and soon a book edition will be published, which will contain exhibited portraits.
Two years ago, Bauer's passion for portraits led to the idea of repeating the idea of "Portrèche sports veteranan" ("SportARTproject").
Although their concept from "Flamenco-people" is different, the photographer admits that "to photograph people, to know them and to have the opportunity for a moment, whether longer or just shorter, to enter their lives - it's my passion.
I think the picture is the most difficult of genres.
A person meets or meets people, personalities he never even knows, or gives him a few minutes to shoot.
Despite similar circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
The collection of portraits of the current flamenco named "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the Galerie El Fotómata in the street de la Mata 20, parallel to Alamedo de Hércules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llossa admitted that the novel that writes is "trophies"
She is playing in an environment she does not know yet, and she tells about events for her unknowns, yet Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully implement her new project - she is working on a novel whose main hero is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for 20 years and also traveled to Amazon.
The everlasting favorite Nobel Prizes for literature yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia admitted that the project that just employs him "is trophies", and that "it all testifies that I should not write" this novel.
"If I had any sense, I wouldn't do it, but I'll do it and I believe I'll finish it once," he finished his contribution to the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that he saw in the city for four days around a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people.
Roman author "The City and Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third anniversary of the celebration of the word and fulfilled expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for the most popular writer - the old Dickens edition of "Our mutual friend" - filled Juan Bravo's theatre in the last place.
With Felix Rome, who introduced him, he had before him a devoted audience who had spent an hour running as water - Peruvian with great precision and a notable dose of humor, recalling in it how from the original "unbelievable adventure" of "the pleasure of a passionate reader" and of the "power to live more than I lived" produced literary transmission; how "the lack of inspiration" by writing "disciplinedly", carefully arranging the text, correcting and rewriting; or how his writing was influenced by Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas and what "memorial images" are the bare basis of his stories.
Hispano-American novelist admitted that "there is no way," how to find out if and to what extent books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is just fun, rainy experience" - he stressed Vargas Lloss with the fact that according to him "acts on people" and "the pressure is to try to turn away from the line", and called for writers to "not subject themselves to freedom" and "take responsibility" of their mission.
Because of the climate, the festival in Pozoblanc is losing - there are no graves
The performance with the cups closing the festival in Pozoblanc was cancelled yesterday morning after confirmation of the notice that the surface of the site is not in good condition.
For this reason, the company, together with Fermín Bohorquez, Pable Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to cancel all the matches.
The unfavorable weather conditions of this celebration have long been difficult for two out of three celebrations.
On Saturday, he made it impossible for the rain during the other planned games.
During their formation, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista were to be built by bulls in the arena on Castilblanc.
But that's how it was celebrated only on Friday.
The winner became Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and was rewarded for a dynamic and aesthetically good performance on his shoulder.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante replaced two wounds with a hollow for greetings and one ear that brought him more uncovered seats in the arena than toreadoric art.
Worse still, El Juli, who was passing through the Los Llanos arena, was unbearable.
In the second round of the drain with no breath at all, most of the crowd made a sharp criticism.
They took control in Alava in a delivery with two thousand kilograms of hashish
In ten minutes, five.
Road control Ertzaintza in the town district of Arminíón (Alava).
The owners stop two people driving in the delivery and they drive them.
The charge, more than two tons of hash, is not to be stopped.
According to the report of the Committee of the Interior, the Basque Government was followed up and detained by one of the drivers in the delivery, a man 38 years old, who was identified as A.A. J.
He was detained for drug possession and for falsifying state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit carried out road checks on the N-1 in places where the border of the town district of Arminíón is crossing.
They were going to stop the delivery for control, but the driver didn't listen to the instructions, hurried and caught.
The car crews started to land as soon as the vehicle stopped at the edge of a few miles further, at that moment both passengers jumped out and fled to the forest.
Eventually, Ertzaintzy’s crew chased one of them and played 2,178 kg of hashish, which suspects carried out a survey of Iveco Daily’s brand.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hash packages, which were subsequently transferred to other police departments for detailed expertise and drug weighing.
In addition, the police found that the badge was "stamped" and did not agree with the data contained in the delivery documents, which is why it was also accused of falsifying state documents.
Ertzaintza continues searching for a second suspect who, as mentioned earlier, has managed to escape in order to finally determine the origin of the drug he has used.
The detained A.A. J., 28 years old, was transferred to the police department to handle the appropriate formalities before he later joined another investigation.
Herečka Heather Locklear is detained for driving under the influence of drugs
Herečka Heather Locklear, popular Amanda from the Melrose Place series, was detained this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of drugs.
The Witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers when she tried to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, told the magazine People Talking California Road Watch.
The witness made it clear that around 4:30 p.m., Locklear's "prayed on the gas, walked forward and backward for loud noise, and tried to get out of the parking lot - several times when the sunglasses were slammed over".
The Witness who didn't recognize the actress at first saw Lockleare the moment she stopped at a nearby highway and got out of the vehicle.
This person also alerted the rescue service because "she was afraid of Lockleare's life".
When the police came to the scene, she found an actress inside a vehicle that partially blocked the vehicle.
"She seemed disoriented," and that's why the members took her to a specialized drug and alcohol center to run the test.
According to the police spokesperson, the actor cooperated and an excessive amount of alcohol was excluded, however "we think Locklear was under the influence of some medicines, which was seen by the officers at first sight".
Locklear was detained for suspected behavioural effects of a non-specified substance and about 7 p.m. was arrested, although she was released for free for several hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a treatment clinic where she recovered from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists on the Andalusian Association of IU to exercise its powers in the Silva case
Director General IU and Member of the United Left Gaspar Llamazares announced today that the final decision in the case of the former Advisory Committee on Youth and Sport of the Council in Seville Francisc Manuel Silva, who resigned from the office last week after being accused of dealing in favour of his family, will depend on the regional association of the party.
"I'm too federalist, it's on the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers," Llamazares pointed out the deal, to which the party will have to move in relation to the former member of the Seville City Council.
However, the head of the IU insisted that in the case of the investigation of the illegal conduct permitted by Silva, "transparency" is absolutely necessary: "IU has always fought to ensure that such matters are as transparent as possible."
He also stressed that the party has a "strict code of ethics for all public functions".
"Plumb blood" ('Sangre de Mayo'), Garcia's epic bet
José Luis Garci in the film "The Blood of Flowers" (Sangre de Mayo), to which he was inspired by Episodes of the National Past of Benita Pérez Galdós, revitalizes the famous rise of the Spanish against the French – it is the most ambitious film in his film with a budget of around 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker wanted to "explain the essence of the character and analysis of society", which he always admired in part of the famous novelist, explained today with Quim Gutiérrez and Paul Echevarría during the presentation of the picture before the vast team of interpreters.
May's blood with a meter over two and a half hours will be put into cinema this Friday and in the future there's going to be more than four-hour TV series Telemadrid.
As a great admirer of the literary creation of Galdóse José Luis Garci claims to have fulfilled his "childish dream" by filming this film, thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, whom three years ago he entrusted to the Autonomous Province of Madrid by filming the two-year anniversary of Madrid on 2 May, he accepted the offer that the event would come from the National Past.
The budget of 15 million, to which the Madrid province has fully contributed, means for Garcia "the only opportunity" to create an environment with scenes and costumes corresponding to the image of "the shaking Spain, which was wrong in the leader for whom it was to fight - the struggle for independence led to the fall and the rest of the country," he said.
The director, however, regrets that he could not count on the financial support received from the films The Sad Wing (Ala sade) or Goy's ghosts - almost double the number of Floral blood - so he could not record some of the scenes from the script signed at the same time by Horace Valcárcel, with which he worked almost all the way to the film.
The director of the movie "Start Again" (Volver and Empesar) works as he is usually used to - on the stage with the actors he usually does before the film and does not choose casting, because it seems to him to be "demeaning" and it is also believed that "part of the director's profession is to go to the theatres and cinemas and thus to find out what's going on in the business he's dealing with".
Many actors who have chosen for Flower's blood are already appearing in front of his camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larranága or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Garci with four nominations to Oscar, one of which he won, is the view that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the May Blood itself, the seven tables of the French billiard and the last selected blind sunglasses represent the young generation of the Spanish film scene, but he claims that "it will only appear".
Garci doesn't expect any awards for this movie.
"At first you think you're working for what's next, but then you'll realize that you're only working for the benefit, and then you're going to volunteer to make another movie," Garci explains with more than 30 years of director's career.
Isabel Bayón Revives the Spiritual Link of Sevilla Dancer Tortola Valencia
The Sevillis dancer flamenca gives up the hold of other Sevillis dancers.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, from the father of Catalan (Florence Tórtola Ferrer) and mother of Andalusanka (Georgena Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Triana, and when she was three years old, they moved with their family to London.
She danced modern dance and focused on Oriental dance.
She lived her life full of passion, was a pioneer of women's emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and was fighting for the abolition of the corset, which made it impossible for women to move freely.
The life of this woman, influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of the inter-war Europe of Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepou Gamboa and she suggested this character to me - it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, it's not about telling her life, it's about the capture of the soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of the flamenco rhythm.
So my "motive dance" was evocating a guajira or "hada dance" some tanga.
Her dance was meaningful and they told me that my dance of this aesthetic also matches," she says.
The performance is calculated by involving two exceptional characters: Miguel Sveteau, who will sing Isabelle in one performance as well as in the "Open Doors" (La porta abierta), and with the teacher of the dance Matilde Coralova, who made an exception and joined in collaboration with her former cup.
"Matilde represents the older Tortolo, a mature character.
I am happy that she accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it is a great honor for me."
It also includes the music and guitars Jesúse Torrese and Paca Arriagy, singing Miguel Ortega, el Pulgy and Moi de Morón; drummer El Pájara, violinist Rafa El Viola and co-worker Juanfry Juárez, "who has the role of the eternal guide of this kind of artist who is primadones with everything and who are always in love with them".
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, who played for her time in places such as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, because she was usually living in London.
"I wanted to remind her, because I think she was one of those women who had a huge influence at a certain time, but nobody knows her today and then she appreciates her creation even less," Bayón says.
The show starts today at 20.30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The book "A Fresh Wife's Day" also closes the triennials
The introduction of the first illustrated edition of "The New York Church of Freshness" in Saint Stephen's Church, where Juan Ramón Jiménez closed the synagogue with Zenobija in March 1916, is part of the programme coordinated by the Cultural Council of the autonomous Andalusian government at the celebration of the "Trianal Zenobie and Juan Ramona" (2006-2008), which is organized to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the anniversary of their death.
The "Zenobia Trinale and Juan Ramona" are moving towards the end of the new edition of this work, the international congress to be held in New York, the repair of the Nobel Museum House and the travel exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: On the sunset", which was opened in May of this year, and after dining in different Andalusian provinces, according to plans at the time of the convention, it should be moved to New York.
The Cultural Council of the Andalusian Autonomous Government also ordered eight hundred prints of "Denique of Fresh Married" by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis to continue to spread the knowledge of the personality and part of one of the world's world's Andalusian poets.
America without Paul Newman doesn't like himself that much anymore
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
These are the words of the actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Without Evil Purpose" and under the strain of knowing that Newman had left, she discovered her unsatisfied vision of abandoned American cinema and all America.
Look how long it took them to get Oscar.
And that he's been retired since 2007.
And that he knew he was very sick.
Even so, he was for all the boys.
"Sometimes what a person feels can't express in any way, and I have now lost a great friend," said Robert Redford in tears, "my life and my country were better because of him."
Nobody's afraid he'll be funny or overdrive.
The father of the film and government died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, when American self-awareness is at the bottom of a desperate search for reasons of pride.
When time is harsh and people without honor and only a handful of those who are worthy of you - there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he was embodying almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the official opponent of Richard Nixon and the fighter for lost and won cases, from the drug addiction Foundation based on the honor of the firstborn son who died on overdose, until after his own brand of home food and biofood.
A total treasure for a country that has made a lot of effort to forgive itself from a self - killing food culture.
The stormy wave of surprise flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, found that not one man died, but one era.
Another Englishman, the keeper of Oscar's Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was without overwork as the top of his career.
Bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, Troufl Newman label himself his greatest source of inspiration.
"This fox has put us all on a very high ladder," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today has the courage to try to live as Paul Newman lives - based on honesty and leads a serious private life away from the cameras.
It's not always easy in today's media jungle, sometimes not even possible.
But luckily such people are and Paul Newman is their model.
He divorced once, and since then he has been married for 50 years with Joanne Woodward, who has been faithful, despite having more than enough opportunities to be.
"Why would I go out to a hamburger when I have a filet at home?"
May he be led by pride in the heavens by the fact that there will be an alliance in the earth between his daughters and his admirers - in America it is not too common.
It is said that "of all the great roles that he played, he was the most proud of the role of a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather, and a philanthropist."
Imperfect competitions of the Madrid Olympics
Yes, many of us want the Olympics to take place in Madrid, and after the unsuccessful year 2012, it may be 2016.
But I'm asking, are we ready?
If we run the race last night, I say no!
It was about him as a perfect race, and according to my court, he was the worst I've ever been to.
Such a dream of nonsense that, as soon as it came to judgment and I was trying, it would be clearly not enough.
But let's take a look at it from the beginning, pretty one by one.
Nonsense begins with picking up a race number, which is why a person has to leave first.
It doesn't seem bad to me, but when a man goes there, let them give him everything (including a chip that is supposed to prevent overcrowding).
Oh, no.
Here the man had to pick up the number (first nonsense, go there only because of it) and (after the proper front) - what a surprise! - they only had a shirt size S (second nonsense, because I need the size XL).
Where do we live?
That's because of the crisis they decided to buy just a little shirt, because it's less of a substance and it's cheaper?
All right, well, these are little things compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to having to go very soon for the chip and the front on it lasted over 15 minutes, he had to give up the bat.
Over 35 minutes of waiting time, which is in the race, where 11,000 people are expected, something incomprehensible.
So, as expected, the race started, and we haven't put down the bats yet, and by the time it's done, with the pickup, it was much worse.
Moreover, waiting lasted 40 minutes of rain, leading to a general riot and an attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have a flood tomorrow, and some of us, like me, will not show the right time to evaluate the results for the chip that they gave me and which, I suppose, did not record the right time to start.
Of course, if someone asked me for a perfect race, I wouldn't think of this.
And so I think we're gonna have to let the well-prepared Olympic town seem.
Microsoft seeks reception (virtual)
At the conference on new MIT technologies, Microsoft presented further developments in the new image recognition system and human interaction in a way of artificial intelligence - not too intelligent, but able to perform basic tasks such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a messenger who would move around the entire area of the company) and to realize what they hear in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system that recognizes shapes and faces, this "receptive" can find out how many people are in the room who are - even remember what they have on them - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
It is also able to distinguish between the present according to the conversion groups.
On the demonstration video, the reception is recorded by a third person and he understands that he is not part of the group he is speaking to and that he is not an employee of the company.
She's asked if she's going after anyone, and she tells her she's going to be dedicated in a moment.
It's all without a blue screen of death.
Deceptive.
But of course it's the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week was a lot of talk about changing Microsoft's strategy.
Windows 7 will be easier and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers only had the most necessary, without any commercial surpluses, they would be five times more efficient - man, Steve, for they would be cheaper.
Discover as a noise when we think that Microsoft version adds a new feature to Windows and another extra.
A change of direction would be a deserved act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing importance and so is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared online, I became one of those who adhere to the theory that it was Google's first step to competing with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is a necessary layer for understanding between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband, when you have to say something to your chin.
That's right.
It never disappears, but there is a need to think about the "death" of the operating system, not as absolute truth, but as relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People continue to pay less attention to the operating system and, on the contrary, to the Internet browser.
Computer is turned on to start Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time on the Internet than around windows.
What is used for half of the applications that run the system?
There's more to it.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
Hope they need it, and here's a little example.
I took this picture in a rest room for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
On the drinking machine there was a poster that was asked to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the web.
Last week, by the way, it confirmed the delay of the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It won't come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, we'd rather count until 2010.
In Microsoft they will certainly try to market Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more computerized.
Given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay for the delay of the debt.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso carried him on the Azure coast, Leonardo di Caprio in one shot at Edward Zwicka's "Blood Diamond" as well as Al Pacino in the "Kmotro" Francis Ford Coppoly, and is also part of the uniformed gay community.
And if we want to go into the calculation of his role in life, we can sink to the image of a typical muscle with a spicy spine that raises the effects of the cat's circus.
It's basically nothing more than a typical cotton pantyhose, attached and with no sleeves.
English speakers call him 'tank', but only Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels excels all others.
For the first time for his colonic name - even though people call him 'Marcel' - which is related to sport, because, according to the legend, it was named after the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the singer's lover Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out above other quality cotton, unisex shirt, distinctive label and (almost unknown) Belgian flag, which have models of non-embolic tiles as a detail at the neck.
And be careful, because the Belgian firm is not just specializing in the tank tops.
He also manufactures makeup colleges, retro boxers, cashmere lights, cotton pants, marine shirts, clothes for children, mini shorts...
Thoughtful pieces for comfortable underwear.
Although it's a shame to be just a underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother.
Her sister’s immense image did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz, though small, is a woman full of life.
Their new behavior in fashion now takes Cruz's sisters very seriously.
For Monica, it means much more than just that some nice, famous girls will pass their name.
In Paris, Mango also took part in the promotional event organized by Mango in its new residence, and the announcement of the most important fashion prices that this Spanish company sponsors.
She's hearty and brave and she'll get you close.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to introduce a new collection that we proposed to Sister Penélope for Mango for this summer-winter season, and at the same time I participated in the announcement of the second year's "Mango Fashion Awards" and dinner in Opera for Valentine's Day.
So it was a stressful, but exciting day at the same time.
What is your new collection for Mango, for which you have been working for the fourth season?
My sister and I love movies from the '50s and '60s, and we've pulled a lot of moves from them.
I also enjoy walking around the city and watching women walk around dressed, combine and layer their clothes, I do that very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but at the end of the day, it's all connected, and it's got a lot of connections.
I must have liked the clothes, I still wanted to go to my grandmother's, talk in my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was a sensation, much better than going on the road.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of my dress.
But you know that we dancers are based on how we're adjusted to feel good about our hours and tests when looking at the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, you'll really get in.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You've had 30 recently, have you been hit by a crisis?
Where are you going?
I'm feeling better than ever before, I'm having fun for 30 years.
I find that the woman is ready, her experience and her life tastes less mistakes.
The biological hours don't scare me.
I do what I want, and it gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking of being a mother, aren't you?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my body wants it, and besides, I want to be a young mother, I don't want to waste it.
As far as father is concerned, I don't care.
But one thing I know for sure, I'll give my child a sense of happiness and raise him with great love.
As for the movie, there are now a couple of movie premieres you filmed last year.
That's right, and I'm looking forward to it when they come to the movies.
I'm from the theatre world, so I'm very impatient and restless, I want everything right now and that's not going to work.
We look forward to the premiere of "The Last Hour" and "In search of the tomb of Christ".
Approved how you like them...
A couple of days ago, you had your premier on the front of Naomi Campbell's side, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'd go to the mill as a model.
Only Naomi Campbell called me, which I have known for a long time, and invited me to London to participate in the benefit screenings for her "Women for a Better Life" organization, and the clothes that we presented - I also selected two models from our collection for Mango - were thrilled and the outcome was handed over to this Naomi's NGO.
People don't know that Naomi has such a good heart.
It's about a lot of things, and since I know her, I can tell you that many of them are not true.
Besides, I'm gonna stick to the good thing he's getting involved in.
She asked me to present for charity purposes, but if she asks me to make a stand, I'll do it.
In the interests of the women of the Third World, I will do whatever it takes.
Drivers re-acquiring alcohol in their blood will have to install "alcohol"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that a driver with three administrative sanctions for alcohol control should install a system in his car that prevents him from getting drunk or if he is currently getting drunk.
The proposal has been made known already in June of this year and is now included in the annual report of the High Representative of the State, according to which it is a pilot project lasting one year.
Its aim is to return drivers to the steering wheel, so drivers will also have to complete the course of traffic overhaul.
This experience will be shared by the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Office of the Technical Institute for Safety of Vehicles (FITSA) in addition to the National Transport Safety Authority.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 % of drivers charged with more than once driving drunk again in this state will be seated as a wheel.
Alcolock should prevent this because it is a system connected to a vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the breath and prevents the start of the car if the driver is already inactive or if it is recorded higher than the permitted concentration of alcohol.
Its price exceeds 1,000 euros and it would have to be paid by a winemaker himself.
The study carried out in the USA in 2007 showed that in vehicles equipped with these devices, the number of offences was reduced by 65 % during the first year of introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 people could be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to resolve this behaviour before it is committed.
And in order to help him introduce him, since legal correction can be carried out in a normal manner, however, the necessary adjustment of criminal provisions requires a change of law.
The equipment is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, although some industrial vehicles and public service vehicles have already been tested.
The Congress of Members will vote tomorrow on the proposal of the PSOE (Spanish Labour Party) recommending that this system be installed on school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With British precision, at 17.40 a.m., as it was in the program, arrived in the presidential hangar at Benita Juárez Airport in Mexico D. F., a Spanish air force aircraft, in which the prince and princess from Asturias traveled.
The sun had just fallen, but his papers had so far had to close their eyes to see the succeeding couple coming out of the plane.
Under the steps became a Spanish ambassador and other officials.
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver if he knew that a Spanish prince and a princess were coming to visit the state.
- Yeah, well, it's great, so it won't be possible to get to the airport to pick up people... she's from here or what...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she's been living here for a few years.
- Yeah, that's...
However, the Mexican press knows who the prince and princess of Asturias are and how important their visit is.
A lot of people are waiting in the hangar at the airport right next to the red cover and the military cordon, which consists of 27 marine soldiers ready to shoot an honest rescue.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a dark blue dress and a princess, very mid-dressed and hairy, he does not have his usual "peeptoes", apparently reported to her that in D.F. the storm is threatening.
Before they go into the hall, where the official delegation is waiting, they smile at the photographers and start them without forced intervention.
At the doors of the hotel where they will be accommodated, one of the four largest in the city, there is a reported Mexican television reporter waiting for them.
Best Price Added Fashion
There is probably no more suitable place in the world to declare a fashion price than Paris and there is probably no more significant designer and bonvivan than Valentino.
Mango just announced the second anniversary of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to allow the international presentation of new fashion talents.
The price is EUR 300,000.
Belgian Sandrina Fasoliová, the winner of the first year, saw her proposals yesterday at the Manga Exhibit on Paris' Haussmann number 54 bubble and almost cried with a hug.
Of course, it is the second largest trade in this company in Europe and it has just been opened on the 1,335 square metres.
The biggest one is in London.
Many of the events along with the desire to thank the draftsman of Valentin for taking over the presidency of the Competition Court led us to dinner in the Paris Opera Garnier.
The famous Presidential table by the company Mango looked at the most significant Chagall works even more wonderful.
Nati, who with a heartbroken regret for the recent death of her brother, did not reveal anything, wore the clothes of this brand and the jewelry of ELAH, over which he was hiding his breath, and hung into her son Luise - almost two metres elegant - accompanied Valentin in front of the table at dinner for his honor.
Andik, the chief and owner of Mango, welcomed him and, as a real gentleman, stayed with Baron Rothschild without a jacket, because they both offered them two ladies.
Monique Cruz, who arrived at the shop in - specially designed - pants and shirts and turned into long black dresses for dinner, touched the night walk after the opera with Goy Toledová, showed us the gymnasium and, in memory of other times, caught one of the sticks and pointed out "great gas".
Inés Sastre did not hold up on a visit to the side buildings of the palace, but she showed us her son’s photos on the phone before leaving.
The next morning we were able to love the presence of Oliver Martinez - another young man who rides on a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who came to the Paris Intercontinental hotel with his own clothes and towels and first asked for no flavor in his room.
Stars under the starry Paris sky.
Oh, there, that's life.
1001 - counter stress number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget a chaotic and irritable everyday life.
And in order not to be short, all are summed up in one book, which will bring to the book of relaxation on 30 September.
The wake-up call every morning at 7 o'clock as a punishment, but it's even worse to imagine yourself swallowed up in a successful rhythm that brings the present life.
The office is called tension and the computer's back pain.
Stress is a 21st century disease.
However, there is neither one nor two ways to fight daily exhaustion and to get rid of the world of work.
No, that number is nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Susannah Marriott, outside the yoga position, classical massages and "spa" therapy on her books pages, gathered all the "menu" options adjusted according to the taste and time options of each individual.
The protest book is called "1001 way of relaxing" and thanks to the loading of Pearson Alhambra and DK, it will bring peace to the bookstore.
If anyone feels that it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as employment or personal relationships, the "handbook" rejects this view.
It also offers other methods such as contacting nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you don't have adrenaline in your veins, which restores balance in your body and the stress becomes a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, turn off and focus on reading.
Sleeping Speech
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean those who wake up and the kids tell us something that happened the day before, but the kids who talk while they're sleeping.
If it happens first, it may make you feel better, but it's really irrelevant.
It's a harmless sleep disorder called sleepwalk.
She's quite common, especially among children and teenagers.
Of course not one of you was told he was talking from sleep at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadicly (for example, once for life in high fevers) or with a higher frequency (every day, once a week, once a few months...), the second day the child doesn't remember anything.
There's not only one reason that would explain her approach.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night anger, enuresis nighttime (nightly assistance) or monthly, but does not have to be like this.
As mentioned earlier, it can often accompany very high fevers, stress, or tense situations.
In any case, it's a rare phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak in a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or just the opposite (screaming, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where a child appears with great strength, it would be appropriate to observe and consult with the expert to find out if he has any problem that causes him great anxiety and thus manifests himself.
We said it was a non-injurious disorder, so it is not treated unless it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (e.g. if it is associated with apnea syndrome or with permanent stress).
However, we can do this by keeping in mind a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Try not to disturb the child too much before he goes to bed.
So look for peaceful games and avoid violent TV programs or shows.
For very nervous children and those who are able to relax at work, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain some inner peace.
This will allow the child to sleep more quietly.
When a sleepwalker shows up, try to stay calm.
Remember, she's harmless to the child and she won't remember anything from what happened the other day.
Useful advice
Don't be him.
It's unnecessary because he's unconscious and you're interrupting his sleep.
Even when he's talking, he's sleeping, and then he's resting.
Remember that if you feel that you have a lot of trouble repeatedly, it would be good to seek advice or find out what causes such anxiety in your child.
If you understand what he says (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to interrogate him and draw information from him.
It won't work because when he's asleep, he's not aware that he can get his thoughts fixed.
Besides, you'll hear what he says, but you don't know what he thinks, and so why he says it, so be careful how you interpret the information and the conclusions you come to.
Never tell the child that you can ask him about his secret at night.
Not with a joke.
That's causing a lot of anxiety.
Don't be too worried, it's nothing wrong, it's just an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally.
Illhaeusern finally found his way to victory again after a long period of loss.
Without having to win a big game in particular, the yellows created more chances and were able to change one of them victoriously.
The game did not have too fast a pace during this encounter, in which the attackers were hardly prodded.
After the first attempt by the captain of Kauffmann's guest, who shot from a distance only about the hair of the last associate, began to have Illhaeusern slightly on top and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne air, Romain on a long foot or also Diebold gradually came to shake the defense of Denmark.
The opponent set up a defensive wave in the middle of the field and left only an agile Riahi on the edge of the attack.
The beginning of the second half turned out to be decisive, first thanks to the two chances of Dannemarie with the names Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the score for Illhaeuerern, which Marais took care of, well located for the treatment of the ball reflected by the previous Diebold attempt (53').
However, Gólman Illhaeuserna was not happy for a long time, and after about twelve minutes he was forced to return to the dress and leave his teammates in a state of weakness.
However, Dannemarie was unable to pull out of this and 11th from Illhaeuern, who just stepped down a little to "stop" the defense, no longer posed any major problems, except for the final seconds of the match, when the ball after the big mistake flew very close to July.
Sarkozy is going to strike the angry fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a ride across Britain.
In order to face demonstrations of the strength of fishermen who severely disrupted access to several British and Norwegian ports on Monday, the French President decided to go to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives.
The latter promised to accept "in a constructive spirit", and they hope that "comes with concrete proposals".
The Presidential visit comes at the same time as a valid meeting of the "crisis committee" created by Breton fishermen in order to obtain measures against the rapid rise in oil prices, which reached an average peak of 1.14 euros per litre.
According to the spokesperson of the Palace of Elyssey, David Martinon, the president "will talk to them about solutions that can be imagined to help their firms regain competitiveness and better ensure conditions of employment and payment of seafarers".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to fish with incapacity.
On Tuesday morning, operations were carried out in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10km of traffic.
The recreational port in Quiberon was also blocked, but connections towards Belle-île were not interrupted.
A filtration overhaul was carried out on the island of Quiberon.
The mariners proved their determination already on Monday, when, immediately before the stockpiles of cargo of ports in Brest and Lorient, tyres and pallets were on fire while in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc were on demonstrations.
The movement extended to other ports on the Atlantic coast and to the Channel of La Manche, such as the Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where the traulers remained at the port, or to Le Havre, where about 20 vessels blocked the operation of commercial ships.
Fishermen from Turballe and Croisica in the Loire-Atlantique area during the evening stopped the blockade of important Refinerie Total in Donges.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until they decided to act themselves, until the mid-term meeting at the Ministry.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will decide on how to proceed on the way forward and on its participation in the preparatory meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris on Tuesday.
However, some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the State Fisheries Committee who did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will not let anything go" and "do not want to go to Paris", said Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Fisheries Committee in Lorient.
Fishermen from a profession who do not pay oil tax are currently about 50 cents per litre, however, consider that the ship’s yield threshold is reached only if the oil is below EUR 0,30 per litre.
Paul Newman's great-grandfather
An unforgettable representative of "Butche Cassidy and Kid" died of cancer at the age of 83 in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes were also given the legend of the film and the politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery requirements for 2008
This year, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer relies on the delivery of 215 aircraft, through the threat of recession, which rises above the world economy.
The world's fourth aircraft designer, Embraer, maintains its delivery requirements for 2008 with 215 devices added, confirmed his president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer added 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian builder promises a great deal from the Chinese market, especially with 30 to 120 seats on the skyline of his aircraft.
To date, Embraer has added 41 devices to Chinese customers within eight years.
AIG considers a 15 % reduction in its assets
The insurer of the American International Group, whose U.S. money offices have got over the water, believes that he would raise more than 15% of his assets in order to pay 85 billion dollars, which he was given as a deposit, writes a Sunday issue of the Financial Times.
The AIG is prepared to examine the sale of most of its activities outside the life insurance policy in the international field and pension activities in the United States, clarifying a journal that quotes sources close to the ongoing proceedings.
According to FT, the AIG Board met on Sunday evening to investigate the possible behaviour.
No confirmatory declaration could be obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to redeem include its branch of International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% participation in the Transatlantic Holdings insurance insurer, as well as its portfolio of properties and investment in private equity, provides FT.
No final decision on these procedures has yet been taken, FT continues.
AIG must quickly obtain cash to pay off the 85 billion loan provided to it by the Federal Reserve Bank at the risk of being given 80 % of its capital by the U.S. authorities, while also diluting the relevant shareholding ratio of the current shareholder.
Paris. Analysis of the historic meeting Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange noted a historic decline on Monday after the Snowman's representatives rejected Paulson's plan to save the bank: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, which is an invisible loss approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped by 777.68 points at 10 365.45 points.
The biggest ever-turned point in its history (about 684.81 points) was recorded on 17 September 2001, on the day of the resumption of trade after the 11 September terrorist attacks.
The Nasdaq index with the dominant technological component lost, according to definitive data after the end of the trade, 199,61 points and set to 1,983,73 and the extended Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8,81 % (i.e. 106,85 points) to 1,106,55 points.
Since the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street has literally failed following an unexpected rejection of the plan to save the Bank's Snapshot Representatives, a plan that should allow for some stability to be re-established in markets.
228 votes against and 205 abstentions refused to provide the Secretary of State with the funds he requested.
Almost two Republicans out of three rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress is unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piezza from FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added and expressed concern that the project adopted in a few days did not come "too late".
"If this project is indeed doomed to bankruptcy (...), the staff will be transferred immediately to Fed (the U.S. Central Bank, at red.) and to other central banks to alleviate the crisis, which would further strengthen the credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, the leader of the Global Insight economy.
And with emphasis on the urgency of the situation, Piezza noted that in the United States "every new day brings down one financial institution".
After Friday's crash, Washington Mutual organized the bank's bank's bank's repurchase activities with its Citigroup rival.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly turned around and demanded urgent intervention in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which indicates that markets are not "only faced with the American crisis, but with the world crisis", he added an analyst from FTN Financial.
The bond market has risen strongly.
The yield from the 10-year cash return fell to 3,632 % against 3,827 % on Friday evening, to 30 years against 4,161 % on 4,357 % on the previous day.
Obama won points in the first television duel
After the first Friday debate between the two candidates in the White House, the second debate followed, with the task of identifying which of the two John McCain and Barack Obama won.
Leadership of the Republican and Democrat campaign did not surprise them when both declared their victory on the television duel, which was followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, however decent, was not "blilliant" enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential elections, a decrease in research.
The Gallup Constitution, whose public opinion survey published on Saturday, gives Obama a five-point bid (49% versus 44% for McCain), considers that the democrat is the one who won the duel.
Among the undecided voters concerned, Obama is the winner of 39 % of the respondents, while, according to the CBS survey, 25 % is the winner of McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm its leadership on Thursday with the anticipated good performance of his associate, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his opponent, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's very gifted," however, he warned about the weekend Bill Clinton.
Seventy-one McCain has consistently raised his undisputed experience in foreign policy, while at the same time stressing the "naivity" of his opponent in the issues that created the core of the first encounter.
"It seems Senator Obama didn't understand that..." sounded repeated.
"I don't think Senator Obama would have enough experience and knowledge to become president," he said.
In such an aggressive spirit, they were taken from yesterday's Republican TV spots.
On the contrary, both stressed that it represented the future.
He didn't lose his mind and he turned out to be smart and precise.
He raised his ability to make the right decisions and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
"McCain didn't understand yet, while Obama did," he said about the weekend democratic spot, which tells the Republican that he is not sufficiently aware of the impact of the crisis on "the ordinary American".
"During the ninety-second debate of that John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said yesterday in front of 20,000 people gathered at an election meeting in North Carolina for a rainstorm.
He didn't even say words like "middle class" or "worker". The financial breakdown clearly benefits Obama, whom the Americans consider to be more capable of saving the economy on the brink of destruction.
"The next week could be a decisive return," said influential democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, former member of Clinton's administration, compared Obama's "economic bias" to that of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis in 1998.
For the candidates of the democrats, the current funeral is "the final verdict of eight-year bad economic policy, the way George Bush operated it and the way Senator McCain supported it".
The Senator of Illinois reiterated that, despite unexpected Wall Street jumps, he should be able to reduce taxes by 95% of Americans, and also noted that the realization of any energy independence of the country by promoting renewable energy sources is his priority number one, together with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain is planning to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates carefully avoided questions regarding the $700 billion (EUR 470 billion) financial assistance plan that Congress adopted last night, which is highly unpopular.
"What, did you notice that there were some elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday evening at the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections.
Several hundred Belarus gathered on Sunday evening immediately after the closing of the polls at the main square in Minsk to protest the irregularity of the elections to parliament.
Although no results have been stated so far, many young people have come to protest against President Lukashenko's regime: "dictator, demise".
Some admit that they didn't even go to the elections, "What would it be like if they did what they wanted to do with my vote," says one young man.
They do not believe that this regime, which has been committed to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, would be prepared to turn towards democracy.
Penalties, including the prohibition of visas for 40 Belarusian sex offenders and the freezing of certain assets, could be abolished if the election of the observer is considered to be clear.
The opposition said it wasn't.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions, and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting of votes," said Juri Potemkin, a spokesperson of the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse group of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," says Alexandr Milinkievič, former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential elections and the leading personality of the pro-European movement, "because it is important who counts the votes, and we have an executive power.
If some opposition MPs get to Parliament, it will be by being appointed and not elected.
However, their entry into Parliament can mean a place on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals."
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in political action, because "a dialogue with the European Union must be initiated.
If our economy, which is deeply indebted to Russia, is going to hit the crisis and we are not reforming, we are threatened with becoming a protector of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has been monitoring the elections, will not declare the elections valid.
It stresses that participation seems too high and that the general introduction of an early vote (26% of the voters in Minsk) opened the way to all possible manipulations.
"What, did you notice that there were some elections?" wanted the socio-democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
"There was no foot in the election room.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition Members in Parliament, those who most suit the regime."
The night's silence was lost again in the October square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Conversation - Blood, which is safe again
Hema-Québec celebrated its tenth anniversary yesterday, and his president, Dr. Francine Décary, was rightfully pleased because Hema-Québec became one of the most reliable and inefficient blood suppliers in the world.
Above all, he regained public confidence, which was seriously shaken by a scandal involving contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is generally known, the State reserve of blood administered by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Committee was contaminated by an immune deficiency virus (HIV) and a hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
As a result of this drama and the wave of public unrest, the Canadian government launched a public investigation in February 1994 by Judge Horace Krever, who was intended to explain the circumstances leading to such a tragedy and to make recommendations that such a massacre should no longer be repeated.
While Judge Krever was delaying the report, some provinces led a committee to plan a new system of blood management in Canada.
In Quebec, Géline's committee was set up.
After Gélineau and Krever's report, two suppliers were established in Canada: Hema-Québec, which was to be managed by Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Society for the Conservation of All Provinces and Both Territories.
"When Hema-Québec started its activities in 1998, almost 38% of people still had confidence in the Quebec blood system," says Dr. Décary.
"The situation was overwhelming.
Through systematic efforts to increase the safety of blood products and the continued work in this area over the next few years, we have regained public confidence," he says and proudly adds that at the beginning of 2008 Hema-Québec had already trusted almost 94% of the Quebec population.
However, Dr. Décary does not lose sight of the fact that "trust is very fragile".
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the principle of discretion.
"At that time we witnessed in Europe the appearance of many cases of the human form of the disease of crazy cows, the new variants of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease," says a woman who has been leading the company since its establishment in 1998.
"And we didn't know if this disease could spread blood.
Therefore, we have relied on one of the basic recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau report, according to which in case we do not know, and when there is a risk of spreading a serious disease, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s disease, which is characterized by brain degeneration inevitably leading to death, must be taken decisive measures.
So in April 1999, we refused blood from people who have stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safely proved that this disease was transmitted by blood.
So this episode showed us that keeping the principle of caution makes sense."
In 1999, a much more accurate HIV detection technique was found on the market: tests using nucleic acid (NAT) that enable the presence of the virus itself to be detected directly in donor blood, and not the presence of antibodies on which previously used tests were based.
NAT tests have been able to reduce the period between the patient’s infection and the moment our blood technology can be detected first, explains the specialist.
This period we have been able to reduce to less than a week.
We have significantly reduced the risk that some donors may be infected without knowing about it and not being able to find out.
This improvement has made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of getting AIDS through blood transfusions.
The risk of getting blood contaminated with HIV is that today one person out of 12 million is exposed.
"In other words, it means that before someone is infected with HIV, 12 million blood products will have to be distributed.
As a result, Hema-Québec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products every year, it will take 24 years for the first case of HIV transmission through the blood product to appear.
I believe that we can get or prescribe the blood transfusions necessary to cure today in complete peace," says Hema-Quebek, head of management.
"The challenge for another decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what pathogen can appear in the system.
Just last year, on the island of Réunion, a chikunganya virus was discovered, which, like the West Nile virus, transmits to the blood by pumping moisture.
It is necessary to be vigilant at all times," continues Dr. Décary and stresses that, in addition to safe supplies, Hema-Québec must also be counted with sufficient supplies.
"They need to grow, because the population is getting older.
As a result of more aggressive treatment of cancer, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has consequences for the blood donor network, which is on average only 3 % of Quebecers eligible for donation."
Every healthy person is at least 18 years old, meeting the eligibility criteria, but can donate blood only once in 56 days, that means six times a year.
14% of the people offering blood are not accepted on average because they are carriers of AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they visited the country where the cold is operating, they are excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3% we can maintain a condition that meets the needs of hospitals.
Deficiency is very rare.
However, the members of the donor network need to be proportionately complemented by how old they are and can no longer donate blood.
However, it is difficult to convince people to give blood, especially to keep it, and to encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so unspoiled today that we will only find an hour to donate blood," Francine Décary says.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone transplants, heart disease, eyeballs and skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before they are stored at Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public blood bank from the dome wire in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, previously considered biomedical waste, flows rich blood to stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago we celebrated the contribution of our thousand blood sample from the dome wire to the bank, and we assume we'll take them back over a thousand years.
At the beginning of next year we should start offering them for transplants," explains Dr. Décary, who describes the blood collection program from the dome rope as very popular.
"Some mothers are disappointed that they do not have access to it," because Hema-Québec has insufficient means to offer this complex and expensive program to all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - Impact in semifinal
The impact of Montreal yesterday at the Saputo stadium during the second and at the same time the decisive quarter-end match on the total number of branches qualified for the semi-final round of the first USL division, thanks to victory 3:1 (4:3 is the goal balance after both matches) over the Sounds from Seattle.
Prisoner Antonio Ribeiro gave the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the two-sided first half, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, the remaining two goals of the monasteries, were visited.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could consult with Matt Jordan for the sake of Sounders.
Note that on Friday during the first of the two matches, the quarter-finals suffered Impact at Starfire Complex in Tukwila in the capital of Seattle defeat 2:1.
The impact will be proportional in the semifinal of its power with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder settled in the home match deficit 3:1 and finally won 4:3, however, Whitecaps entered the semifinal round with the total number of branches 5:4.
The impact should be met with Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series of games will be confirmed to date.
Short - Kovalev's winning goal
The first attack three Canadians are ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alexe Kovaleva, Tomáše Plekance and Andreje Kosticina last night at the Bell Centre sparked an attack on the victory of Canadian 3:2 on their own trips.
Kosticin, the greatest star of the encounter, shot the goal, Plekanec gathered two assists and Kovalev scored one play in this fourth three-coloured match.
Kovalev won by giving the only goal during his own trips.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian warned.
"I need another game to feel good."
"In the first third, he tried to manage too much," Guy Carbonneau noted.
"But I think he evaluated the end of the game.
He had a nice welcome."
Charest bets north
The prime minister does not rule out the early elections by the end of the year
Immediately after the end of the Liberal Party (Libéral Party) meeting, Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where in today's supplementary elections the new Minister of Health of Yves Bolduc (left) is running.
"Remove our last large northern border": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visually binding way at the conclusion of the meeting of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Lévis, but without giving any details.
During his speech, images were projected behind his back in a picture mill.
On three covered plates was a slide with remarkable pictures of hydroelectric fences, down, Quebec from the view of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large-scale funds, like in the pre-election period.
At the other press conference, the prime minister refused to rule out the early elections in the fall, even though he pointed out that he had a very busy program.
The "Sever Plan" is the fourth dimension of the "visa", which the prime minister intends for Quebec, the "new economic space", which includes an agreement with France on labour force, a convention between Canada and Europe and an agreement with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - the northern part of the 49th Equinox - the prime minister has often mentioned in his statements, it has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister limited himself to explaining why the North represents a "chicken with enormous potential", but he did not set a deadline, a level of investment, nor a clear priority in future projects.
He mentioned a number of approaches to points that could be further disbanded: in particular, water plants, forests, but especially the labour sector, which is driven by rapid growth with developing countries and the restoration of public infrastructure.
North, according to Charest's calculations, contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This "territory twice as much as France is with us", "it's in Quebec.
And it's not just us, but it's us," he stressed, as if he wanted to show that he was calling for a certain national fundamental myth.
Quebec was built to a large extent in relation to the North, raised the premiere: the gold hunt in Abidjan, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added after theatrical silence to look at a huge map behind his back.
The north, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always requested, clarified the premiere during the press conference.
"It is a traditional attitude that has been repeated by all previous governments.
There is one borderline order that no longer exists for a long time, and if an opportunity arises, on behalf of the government this attitude will be renewed," he said.
Otherwise, "it is also necessary to rethink our vision of the North in relation to climate change", he said when he was talking about the transition to the north-west, which will be opened all year round as a result of the ice-cream.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that taking the territory becomes an obligation.
And what about the inhabitants of the land, the native nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different sides, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létoureau (former Pakistani MP from Hungary), have already started negotiations with some 30 communities.
The action was initiated by the Inter-Ministerial Committee chaired by Mr Benoît Pelletier, which has an important role for Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources).
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large meeting, not necessarily a summit, but a time when a common vision will be issued.
The development of the North should continue in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "jointly designed, structured and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "visis" as a gas flowing into the vision of the liberal primers who preceded him.
"Like the Liberals before us, we have changed our minds to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was another one of the still disrupted theme of the weekend, which was launched on Friday by a large cocktail that raised Jean Lesage's 50th anniversary in front of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to cross the Beauharnois Centre at the Adélard-Godbout crossing.
"From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, through Lesage, who carried out the Pacific Revolution and the nationalization of the water power plant, until after Bourass, who created the James Bay, our party was able to create the future," Jean Charest said.
At the press conference he appealed to another authority, this time conservative, for the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
When a series came to the hydroelectric power plant Eastmain1a-Ruper, Charest stressed that its launch is planned for 2012.
"I'm just saying it between us, but I'm planning to be there," he trusted his member base, which led to a considerable humiliation.
The same prime minister, who said in April that there will be no elections in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not exclude the possibility of holding elections in the fall of this year, which allows him to law.
However, he stressed that his program is under attack, especially the federal councils in China and the Quebec-New York Summit.
The weekend conference provided the head of the Liberals platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular the "successful to change the constitution", which was much smoother: PLQ (Liberal Party of Quebec) requires particular recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also wishes that Quebec appoints part of the members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Television Council, who should be entitled to veto in the event of decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, the Sever Plan was in its main features to accept sceptically.
Chief PQ (Parti Québec) Pauline Marois once again withdrew the Development Policy in northern Quebec, which the Landry government dropped in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, it refused to implement this policy.
If she held on to it, "we would continue today," Marois noted on the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the elections are taking place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said it would support the adoption of the North Plan in the government.
"We accept, however, that it is not just a theatre," explained Sébastien Proulx, the leader representing Maria Dumont, who is returning from the holidays today.
Letters - Unaccompanied countries
It was Vic Toews, former minister of justice (on irony) in Harper's cabinet, who allowed himself last summer to say about Louise Arbour that she was a "honour" for Canada.
This is how to humiliate a woman who has fought relentlessly for justice and who deserves all our surprises, it tells a lot about the prime minister's environment and Stephen Harper himself.
We have a government in front of us that, as the only one in all the participating Western countries, has not returned to the power of its state agent locked up in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not at all note that at the time when the acts that were committed to it were to be played, Omar Khadr was a young teenager.
The only government that, although Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets it rot under the conditions of a child soldier.
The only one who relies on the parody of justice to judge the accused's guilt.
Note that UNICEF, Amnesty international and, in particular, the Association of Canadian Lawyers are defending the repatriation of Omar Khadra so that there can be a fair trial in Canada.
The same government closes its eyes before the torture: little depends on this young man’s being mentally destroyed in the future, and it no doubt lasted, after so many years of shaking.
We are not aware of this, but we are witnesses to the sad erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", the words that Harper is so excited about and which sound so empty from his mouth.
The time has come when there is no morale: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, mistreat him, imprison him according to the libel of the chief of the minority government (as it will be after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation on the side that announces the Honor, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what has created the reputation and the seriousness of our country.
Shamba is, Mr. Toews, in this denial, not elsewhere.
Views - Orwellovský discourse by Barrick Gold
In the September 17 issue, Le Devoir printed a letter by Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Orwell's logic confirms that the largest gold producer in the world has started charging three authors and a poor small burdenload for an insult to honor with the aim of triggering a "transparent public debate" and demanding six million of them.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of an insult to honor, but the law.
It's no surprise that Garver misses this basic resolution completely.
Or is it for Barrick Gold the best way to lead a public debate, to bring to the fore anyone who dares to defend the wrong position?
Whatever the case may be, the authors and publisher of the book Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend decent amounts in order to be prepared to defend themselves and to fight in a very unbalanced fight with the army of lawyers supported by almost no pockets of the workforce.
The tactics in these unbalanced fights are often used to destroy the defendants in order to establish a trumped-up procedure that shuts the mouth of the opposite side and also frightens anyone who dares to commit this thing.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she had her eyes on the whole thing to present a public opinion.
In contrast to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold acts, in Canada there is a debate on normal circumstances in exchange of ideas, not in wounds.
Therefore, it was not enough for the company to open its books, its documentation and engage in a real debate through the news, the media, the publication and financing of independent scientific teams that could bring light to the whole thing.
However, Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and gradually rejects petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he could demand "public debate" and, at the same time, reject the public's views?
It seems that this word in the Vice-President's world marks only fat-paid lawyers, not all Canadians; it is a rather narrow notion of this concept.
In democracy, the right to speak is also the right of the nationalist.
Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the public who supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does so primarily because he rejects brutal ways of working society.
The public is prepared to hear and assess Barrick, but on the basis of a civilised exchange of arguments, not within the framework of what many consider to be a complaint in which they are to be heard by the accused (as part of their "public debate" complaint, Barrick has, by the way, just called on the authors of Noir Canada to officially inform them that they should stop using this deadline...).
If we mention the surreal Garver's speech, the complaint initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the university's freedom to investigate and seek the truth that is fundamental to every democratic society.
Overall, it denies the right to quote confidential sources and to debate facts and interpretations that constitute the basis for intellectual activity itself.
If in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss topics that do not like the rich companies of this world without being exposed to repeated complaints, who else will be able to do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could create it if she was guided by the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
He has the right to answer.
The university environment we belong to has long been able to lead debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
The excessive claim by Barrick Gold clearly shows that despite what he claims, he does not have the slightest desire to lead a transparent debate.
For the university world, it is a loss, as well as for public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to take measures that would limit such an illegal complaint.
Operation to save Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand
Bush's administration and delegates to Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached agreement yesterday on the biggest saved economic plan since the great crisis of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan, using $700 billion to defuse the financial crisis, which has been raging by Wall Street for months, has yet to be approved by both Congress Chambers.
In particular, it provides for: better control of the elected representatives over its application, new mechanisms to ensure the payment of stored public money, new measures to capture the quantities of non-paid households and also the right to monitor the amount of wages paid by the company's employees.
U.S. Finance Minister Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and the representative of the Republicans at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news yesterday a few minutes after midnight, after the end of the two-day negotiation marathon.
"We have made great progress and we have reached an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush's administration representative, Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done so that the real economy and ordinary Americans are safe from the crisis just taking place on Wall Street," the democrat explained.
"This is the main point: if we don't do it, trauma, chaos and disruption of American everyday life will be huge," said Republican Judd Gregg.
Over the past few hours, the negotiations have run to the maximum turnout from fear of the effect that should be further failures at the investor's mood.
The time limit was the opening of markets this morning.
Both candidates for the US President were invited to negotiate later and both expressed themselves rather in favour of the agreement, but did not mention expressing their dissatisfaction with the need to turn away from such a final solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has signed an agreement on certain measures, in particular those aimed at enabling the owners of the residence and the wage measures of the company's employees.
"If we ask the taxpayers to take special measures for the irresponsibleness of some people, there is nothing to congratulate on.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on television waves.
His Republican opponent John McCain, who was questioned at another station, whether he would vote for the proposed plan, answered, "I would like to see details, but I hope so."
"The rough pictures I've read [show] that it's something we're all going to have to spend and with what we're going to be able to move on.
Choosing inaction is briefly unacceptable," he said.
The objective of the 700bn plan is to buy back the claims and risk and non-sale assets of US financial institutions for taxpayers' money.
The plan comes after 14 months of a crisis broken down by the collapse of a bubble in the real estate market, which first led to the collapse of risk mortgage loans (subprimes), then transferred to another, broader forms of loans (PCAA) and ended up in the freeze of cash and in the interpretation of banks and financial institutions.
The failure of the first proposal for an agreement from last week shall be borne in mind by the Republican Members.
Since the democrats have agreed that some "toxic" assets of companies with problems will only be handled by the government, but will not buy them, they are convinced that the state of emergency is blessed.
In an attempt to bring the opposite views closer to Congress, a measure has been adopted to ensure that the government will be able to introduce new fees that will help it to recover its contribution if, as a result of the programme, it has to bear losses for a period of five years.
The new plan shall be calculated by depositing the first amount of 250 billion to which it will be possible to add another 100 billion if the President deems it necessary.
The contribution of another 350 billion should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for Washington's help, he's going to get shares in saved companies that will pay off his dividends in case of profit, and he's going to be able to sell again when he's after all.
The Federal Government will be able to delay the procedures for the disposal of property related to the loans covered by the plan, as well as to set limits for the amount of assessment and compensation paid to the company's managers.
The officers of the plan would like to vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the effort that has been made, it is not yet certain whether their plan will be green.
Yesterday, votes were taken against both in the Republican and democratic camps.
"It's quite obvious that Washington won't hear you," said Republikain Scott Garrett, a member of the Financial Commission for Photography.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
However, it is not a solution for the taxpayers."
Democratic representative Brad Sherman, moderator of a group of congressmen named "Skeptics Committee", presents the whole thing differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred important economic professors, including three Nobel Prize winners, wrote to us: we ask Congress not to rush too fast and carefully examine which way to go," he said yesterday.
At the same time, Europe has again confirmed that this crisis is a global crisis.
At the end of the extraordinary meeting, three Benelux countries announced a partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group of EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it is derogating from the purchase of its competitor, which is in decline since it lost EUR 2 billion (USD 2,9 billion) as a result of the risk credit crisis on the purchase of properties in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, among the 20 largest European banks and among the 10 largest insurers.
"We're not going to spend this money," Dutch Finance Minister Wooter Bos said yesterday.
"We gain the right to vote in the bank and influence.
And that's exactly what the mayors and the households can really appreciate today."
On the other side of the La Manche channel, the British government seems to have begun another bank in a financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was expected to take over all existing loans from Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion (US$75.5 billion) made loans to purchase property.
According to its announcement yesterday, the Spanish bank Santander will buy out branches and accounts of British bank clients.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government has to announce from the beginning of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of socially engaged icons
His beauty with azure eyes has long represented his trump, according to other weaknesses.
Did this American actor get away with the magic smile of narcissism?
Yes, and no.
The shyness, sensitivity, and unmistakable talents that were his own also distanced him from the force category that produces real stars.
But what a long track it was!
Paul Newman died on Friday in his 83-year-old ranch in Connecticut as a result of lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of fat years American cinematography.
Less massive than Brando, who was like him for a long time by some rival in the film dress, Newman was a more careful actor, certainly a criminal, but also an apostle of freedom and the collapse of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and a mother of Hungarian descent.
From these European roots, one of the famous faces of the American dream was born.
No excessive eg, which is the last sign of quality.
Because it saw this whole country in love with self-made man, a warrior in the war in the Pacific, wounded in a battle that began in the early 50s of Yale, then visited the New York Actor's Studio and celebrated the triumph in the theatre, in television and in the movies.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a car racer who was second to a 24-hour Le Mans race in 1979, and at the same time a sexual symbol, and yet since 1958 he created a model couple with actress Joanne Woodward.
It also leaves the shadow spots of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged star, allergic to the motions of its own show-business, which will forever remain to a certain extent mysterious.
A good man, in the highest sense.
Paul Newman's departure this weekend caused the film's lovers to turn around, while his great role together competes in black dress memories.
After him, he's been defiling for more than half a century, constantly changing American art.
In memory, the charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who will reject his meaningful wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Catalyst, adapts Tennessee Williams from 1958.
From less ancient times (1990), we have equipped his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who was distraught at an advanced age by a marriage that did not meet all expectations.
So many other Newman Pauls have gone into history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, driven, violent, unforgettable delinquency from Somebody Up There Likes Me (In the sign of hatred) Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, taken over after his death, which in 1956 Newman introduced in real knowledge.
Sympathetic gangster in absolutely great The Sting (Podraz), Oscar for the best movie in 1973.
A hot and vindictive ball player in the wonderful The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), the same character is created in The Color of Money Martin Scorese, which will bring him the only Oscar of seven nominations in 1987.
This face of travelling ages, it was him.
And again he did.
In his professional career, he and his team compete in different ages.
Young people especially know her thanks to the cult of Slap Shot George Roy Hill (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlop, a non-traditional hockey coach.
Fans met with him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy brothers Coen.
He then completed his career as a sister of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition Sam Mendese in 2003.
Unlike some film legends that soon left the profession, Newman remained in the industry for a long time, even though he condemned Hollywood with his possessions, adventures and retreats.
The French filmer Bertrand Tavernier, not without humor, considered her "a living challenge underplaying", judged that in his performances he pushed too much on the pill.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the role came as a promotion, the profession was not always so tender.
However, the first lovers played less often than the outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, lumps and desperate ones whose fall and rebellion reflected in his perfect image.
As director of Newman, he discovered little known pages of his shy sensitivity.
His 1968 film Rachel (according to Canadian Margaret Laurence's novel), in which his wife Joanne Woodward plays the leading role, presents a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
To his son Scott, who was lost because of his overdose, he dedicated a 1984 film to Harry and Son, a work full of mud and sorrow.
In the plot that came to Newman yesterday, his great friend and former co-worker Robert Redford (played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said emphatically: "His presence made my life and this country better."
Your Majesty, your love of life, such are the main qualities of a dead actor.
If we mention his legendary career, there's also a great fighter for civil rights, ecology, independent film, opposition to Hollywood's fall.
We used to see his image on bottles of vinegar, milk, biscuits, and other foods, which we might find quite unpleasant, even though it was a gag at first.
However, the profits from the sale went to his Hard Childhood Foundation account.
Newman got so, rather than being flattered by glory, he was in company for the last time.
To his five daughters he left a letter containing these words: "Always and to the end your father was grateful to his happy planet.
I was honored to have been here."
And it was an honor for us to follow the life course of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
And besides, the end of the day, a model citizen.
What was produced in the factory on the invoice Zuschlag & spol.?
Soon, October 8th, counts will begin in criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his associates.
The policy and its partners are, in addition to other criminal acts, including forgery, accused of fraud and systematic criminal organisations, resulting in extremely significant damage.
According to the prosecutor’s office, money obtained in public competitions for their own purposes was used and often presented with fictitious invoices.
Money from the state and self-government - including about 65 million forints - travelled partly to the treasury of Fiatal Balldal, partly to the pockets of individuals.
The information also provided by the investigating authority was based on the fact that the money obtained in public competitions was selected on the basis of invoices for which there was no real counter value and that the company’s commitments were never met.
According to the complaint, most of the invoices were false.
Prints to these invoices came from the Josefvaros market, the bullet seal was made in Kiskunahala.
On behalf of the company the production of invoices has been decided, inter alia, on the road along the northern coast of Balaton, to which Istvan Ladose János Zuschlag sent.
According to his statement, he was first appointed to look at pensions and restaurants.
He applied for accounts for his consumption, according to which the invoices submitted under public competitions issued by, inter alia, the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, respectively, were then produced.
The invoices were issued by most of Istvan Lados with his partner Andras . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
On his "Student Road" Lados saw a basement.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlagem and its partners in 2003 provided this post-hospital dining facility for the 1990s group of Biztos Pont.
However, so many people wouldn't be able to find themselves, according to the company leader in this facility.
In the same way, the invoices issued in the summer of 2002 with the name Jobb Jövâert, later Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért were confused with the formal and substantive errors.
So the guesthouse in Badacsonytomy had only three rooms, more than ten people couldn't sleep in it one night, yet there were a hundred and thirty guests on the bill.
However, the authors of the prints with a rich imagination did not do so even when they introduced documents to the company also dedicated to the hospitality - Pigal s. r. o., in which the accounting information provided to the State representative did not include documents bearing the name of Jobb Jövârt and Hoppá.
The head of the company Győzˈ Farkas for hvg.hu stated that when he was summoned to the prosecutor's office and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew that it was false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were on the seal in the wrong place."
As he added, apart from the formalities, there was no agreement that a hundred people had been accommodated by the bill, so there are only eleven rooms that do not have such large capacity.
In addition, the invoice also included meals, and their restaurants have been out of operation for a long time.
Hot invoice manufacturers did not even know that the prominent Budapest travel office organizes only foreign travel, and on a cash payment invoice, which also did not agree with the company's billing practice, they introduced jokes as a travel brokerage service to Hungary.
Furthermore, as the investigation showed, they also included VAT in the document, although the organisation of travel to countries outside the European Union was exempted from VAT.
On the four documents of the Jobb Foundation, Hotel Révfülöp s. r. o. did not agree, among other things, to the amount of VAT. However, the company does not apply to the activity of the listed 25%, but the 15% VAT, in addition to the print invoices issued by the hotel employees, the invoice was written by hand.
In addition, the "issuers" have damaged the invoice by stating in one company how the investigation of State representation resulted, as a road transport activity, of goods which the company originally did not carry out on investment advice.
The fact that invoices are issued to the Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért Foundation and companies XXI. Sázadi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false, also broke due to formal deviations - the inappropriate format of the invoice and the wrong print.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or the Sports Camp in Kunfehértó, whose representatives denied that they would exhibit invoices.
For example, counterfeiters did not even notice that the company HIB s. r. o. from Nyíregyháza was at the time (2001) where a group of Fiatal Várossért, in liquidation, was eating with it, which is why, according to our information, the company's liquidation commissioner also denied that he would issue the paper.
The invoices were made consciously
The second group of invoicers consists of those who knew they were supposed to exhibit a fictitious invoice.
The Esély Foundation of Budapest has issued accounts for about four million forints for the Harmadik Évezredért Foundation at the request of the organisation Fiatal Balldal - Ifjú Socialisták.
Collab s. r. o. received one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, according to the charge of issuing a fictitious bill.
With Zuschlagm and his partners, Biogate s. r. also cooperated on, currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided the Jobb Jövâért and Atlas and Vörösfena Foundation with invoices worth about five million forints, which were not actually economic activity.
Not even the movement of money, because the invoices created were later cancelled, which, however, the organisation has forgotten to include in its documents.
Another group of billing companies is those who have been bound to the defendant.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the authorised representative of the Ukrainian contractor Delta Trió s. r. o., dealing with the trade in motor vehicles and motor vehicles, with a residence in Budapest, but the company is not to be found.
In October, November and December 2005, the company displayed a number of invoices for the sale of computer technology worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data found by the investigation, these invoices were purchased by the Kishunhalas company Cash Investment s. r. o., which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
One of these companies was a man from Romania who was supposed to submit letters in 2002-2005 concerning Ivan Kubatov.
As we know, in the course of the investigation, Kubatov admitted that he issued invoices on behalf of the company to the companies Atlas, Hoppá and the Együtt Foundation and Harmadik Évezredért and accepted their own counter-value.
On request of Ivan Kubatov, Romanian settlers were founded by Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. r. o. and Jos-Investment k. s.
In fact, none of the companies worked, according to the defendant, because they did not get the job.
However, the companies benefited him because, at the request of the co-indicted lawyer Zsolt Szente, who also prepared their founding letters, he presented the name of the company invoice to Atlas and Y-Generácio connected to Zuschlag.
Name of companies Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave Kubatov a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The State representation has determined that Kubatov has reached 10 per cent of the amounts indicated on invoices and VAT.
For the exhibition of fictitious invoices, this time for the selection procedure for Biztos Pont, a man also used Szi-Beri's company.
In January 2006, Y-Genéráção and Sjövetség and Modern Magyarszágért presented proposals to the Public Competition Federation of Mikhalye Tancsicse (TMA), a public welfare organisation of the socialist party.
They received 500 thousand forints, but did not exceed the amounts for the purposes set out in the drafts.
To avoid this, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices were also found at the home visit at the Arpád Kemecsei Office of the Ministry of Education.
During the calculation of the part of the defendants, it is likely to describe the course of the production of invoices, as she has already done at the prosecutor’s office.
It may be more interesting if the main accused János Zuschlag decides to reveal himself.
His statement is not too detailed, and although he has promised to do so several times, he has not done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - the exchange for paying off a large portion of the damage, fifty million forints, with him perhaps the socialists have concluded an agreement and Zusi will take it upon himself.
He could have been offended so far because his request for a relieving of the conditions of his detention, the placement in the home prison, had not been heard.
While economic offenders, who have suffered much greater harm than they have done, can walk freely or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their homes, he does not have this option.
Psychology of trumpeting: Why waste more money?
In auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, to overestimate goods.
The neurological and economic foundations of this well-known - and apparently irrational - behavior have been able to reveal to researchers in the field of neurology and the economy of New York University.
According to their study, published in Science magazine, people in the eBay auction competition do not want to stay, so they prefer to pay too high a price.
Research using experimental auction tried to map the scheme of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers sat and the other group participated in the auctions, with the method of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) examined the active areas of the brain of subjects.
In both games, participants were able to win money, but in the event of an auction game, the key element of which is to break the other side, began to work intensively during the game, the whole of which is under the brain bark, called striatum.
This brain area plays a role other than many other functions in the "self-reparation" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, it is possible for researchers to explain how they try to avoid the rapid reaction of the striat.
In support of their theory, members of the research team from a number of economists conducted a financial cross-sectional investigation.
Under different conditions, three groups were competing against one partner.
The control group was simply informed of the real value of the product and they made the bets.
In addition, members of the other group were promised that if they left the game winning, they would receive another $15.
On the other hand, the third group received 15 dollars before the auction, but in the event of a loss, its members also lost this money.
The difference between the two groups was therefore all about the fact that one was highlighted as winning and the other as losing.
However, the members of the group playing "against losing" were willing to go higher than it was in the control and "victim" group, which confirms the neurologist's hypothesis.
"These results cannot be derived from any previously existing economic theory.
For so far, they have explained the phenomena that can be seen in auctions of joy from victory and avoiding risk.
When neurological imaging methods helped us to resolve the dispute between these two theories so that we have now reached the third explanation," observed Andrew Schutter, professor of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when to find a doctor?
About half a billion people around the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, then in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the main causes of death.
The number of home cases of hepatitis infection is estimated to be hundreds of thousands, but only seven thousand of them are being treated. The reason is that the patient often does not know they are infected.
The name of hepatitis is the sum of the name of the infection caused by various viruses.
In their symptoms there are many similarities, which are characterized by inflammation of the liver and the jaundice, but the origins of the disease and the disease caused by them differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main ways, depending on the underlying disease: hepatitis type A and E with lawnmowers (e.g. food, water), hepatitis type B, C, D and other blood and fluids (sperm, connective tissue, saliva).
Travellers should in any case be protected by vaccination against virus A and B, and no vaccine C virus exists.
Hepatitis A symptoms occur two to three weeks after the use of an infected food, usually due to nausea, weakness, abdominal problems, vomiting.
Then on the skin and eye whites will be formed yellowish, brightish chairs and cloudy urine. Treatment may last from two to three weeks.
Each year, millions of people worldwide die of the most serious type of this disease, of liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that according to estimates, only every tenth of the infected drug is treated.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious effects: if it is not treated it may lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most people who are infected with their disease don't even know, the originator of the disease destroys the liver cells permanently, so the first symptoms are delivered in many cases up to 20-30 years.
Therefore, early prevention, regular testing is very important.
In three groups, this disease occurs much more frequently than on average: between people who underwent blood transfusions before 1991, between drug users and people with tattoos.
Currently, the estimated global number of individuals infected with chronic hepatitis C 200 million is estimated.
Since the disease can already prove a routine laboratory test, a person should, in case he notices any sign of unknown origin, turn to his medical practitioner.
In early detection, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the body, thus preventing infections and preventing cancer.
September 30th is the World Day of Hepatitis, which was organized by the organizations representing the disease for the first time worldwide in 2004.
Its aim is to highlight the chronic liver inflammation caused by these viruses, the causes of its origin and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Who believes in God, that's what it is?
According to recent research, faith in God is a certain analgesics that could have made death easier for already Catholic martyrs.
Scientists from Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment, examined the way in which faith in the God of perception of pain affects man, reports the British daily Telegraph.
As part of a rather bizarre survey, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were subjected to electric shocks, while all observed the painting depicting Miss Maria.
As a result, the Catholic believers were able to eliminate much of the pain.
Thanks to the technique of carefully examining the human brain, it has also been shown that Catholics have been able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for controlling the pain.
Research is the first of the series of studies attended by scientists, philosophers and theologians from various parts of the university.
The test was carried out in exactly the same way that the test subject’s left hand was attached to the sparking instrument, which produced electrical shocks.
The researchers asked participants to try to observe two paintings: the Sassoferrat Miss Maria from the 17th century and the Lady with the border of Leonardo da Vinci, painted in the 15th century.
The authors hoped that the view of Ms. Marie would create a certain state of worship among the believers, while da Vinci’s image was chosen because it was not too different from the first.
The subjects spent half an hour in the MRI scanner and during this time they received the following 20 electroshocks in four parts, while they watched the picture separately with a religious or general theme.
The Catholics stated that in view of Miss Maria, they felt "in safety," as if they were "taken care of" and "relieved, filled them with peace".
When watching the image with religious themes, they felt 12 percent less pain than when Leonard’s work was ahead of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the research, believes that the same effect can be achieved with any powerful image even among atheists.
"We should find a very positive image from the position of the mother or father," said a psychologist.
The British bishop Tom Wright welcomed the research results.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it will also change our personality," added Wright.
After such excellent results, the question is, What effect would it have on the regulation of the pain of believers if they were to show them some of Leonard’s Madonna or a similar caliber painting?
Would the look at the quality Miss Maria's achievement of even better results mean?
You're what you share
About their tenth birthdays, Google can say that people can find it in their pocket at least as well as in the sky above their heads; they know where they were on vacation, what professional examination is going on, and what interests them.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's bosses, that's still not enough.
However, with regard to skeptics, making parallel with the Orwell's dark vision, they are not exactly the very substance of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently stated for the Financial Times that the main goal of Google is to gather more personal data about users, which is necessary to keep Google’s original intention: “Let’s organize all the information in the world!”
According to the Google representative mentioned, the company is only at the beginning of its ten years of secular work so that it can work with all the information.
To the question that will be answered in five years, Schmidt answered that if Google could answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What work would it actually be for me?" - to such apparently simple questions, however, software will not be able to answer until they know enough about users.
Not all users of the Internet know well that the exact words they searched for during the search are captured, including the IP address they were searched for and the sites they have moved to.
Thanks to the Personalized Search service launched two years ago, users can, for example, keep their browsing history, look back at what they were looking for and what they clicked on, which then in the long term generate more directly adapted findings - the Recommendations service will also be based on the same logic, through which the system will offer us products and services based on the previously mentioned and stored preferences.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone looks at what I'm doing? - users who are afraid of the data monopoly Google.
In most cases, the extent of the potential power represented by the company is more dangerous, the counter-reaction does not cause the internet users to be aware of guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or even rebellion against power.
However, it is confirmed that not only are all the expressions sought caught, but in justified cases a third party may also be issued, in such legal cases the personal rights of internet users are nothing.
The most famous example of recent years was probably coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided information to the Brazilian government that allowed the identification of pedophiles from the community pages of Orkut, established through it.
Internet users who are concerned about personal rights, however, could still breathe in May when the company in hand with the organisation for the protection of EFF's electronic rights successfully proved its truth in the FBI's dispute: Google must not, in the future, be a member of the constitution forced to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully combated nearly fifty thousand web addresses and thousands of search terms that it has obtained by appealing to strengthen before the years of the adopted child protection law, yet it has not been able to obtain a list of individual user items, a full list of web pages and keywords covering a period of two months.)
The view of Google is quite controversial: it is beaten by those who fear to provide their personal data, because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be by using Google's services, exposed to damage, and faced with the revolution that belongs to transnational companies with conservative image.
And so far, the American geek culture and its wild crop, gathering excited computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, in it sees a new generation of big companies, "corporation that now escapes", unlike his rival Microsoft, considered for Windows as the world's buyers, as they both fight for the same purpose.
This can be caused by Google not requiring an identification code from its users and does not want money for its application; open, free and constantly fresh source of information and software packages act as much more accessible, younger, "coolier", than is the practice of official software development.
However, it can also be caused by the fact that the geeks understand precisely the very problematic relationship of the internet and personal rights, which has brought with them just one of the most sensitive keywords in recent years: web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is nothing but cooperation, that we deliberately leave behind the tracks and use the communication channels that we have available, and although their range is different, the essence remains the same: we show ourselves.
An average young person can run his profile directly on several community sites from Facebook to Xang, which can easily connect to other services, such as Twitter or the last.fm app, recording his listening music, all of which can connect to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, in addition to writing a blog on which his latest photo gallery will automatically appear on Flickr or Picase.
At the same time, we can relate to a lot of examples, from which she explains: in the morning, in view of the flood of photos of shared friends, a friend of hers may easily find out who spent the evening with her sly friend, or the company can dismiss his employee just because his blog distinguishes his honest opinion about top management: one thing is certain, the concept of private life has been completely reassessed today.
The person who lives online is made up of what he shows himself, so we could define the basic thesis hiding behind the behavior of today's youth.
And whoever wants to hide something or at least avoid a Google monopoly has an option (maybe Scroogle, which uses Google's search system, but deliberately does not leave any clues).
For example, a small number of people are not registered on community sites, so it is not possible to find them. Online Google applications from the text editor after photoeditor and the news portal can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to huge server parks and that do not set the best possible profile of us.
Public opinion isn't much of a secret waiting for Google to show the dice.
The company has its current value of $156 billion higher than IBM $140 billion), Intel $124 billion) or Coca Cola $110 billion, AdWords/AdSense advertising areas are threatening the investment of advertising agencies and services that are constantly being introduced at a fast pace are seriously displeasing not only to Microsoft but also to many other software designers.
Critic observers, however, also find counterpoints of a disturbing perception: for example, senior management completely rejected employees' protests after raising to two-way fees for corporate school, either often the daily eating of employees was too heavy, according to the company's management, however, the fact that Google was still leaning towards the Chinese government in 2006 and, in the sense of their agreement, was filtering out every finding which is due to the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules seems never to introduce new services before, only when it can be used is certain, however, that the expected problems of the following months and years can move around the world in new places: while some believe that the Google project aimed at scanning and archiving books and magazines has such dimensions that the company will soon have to deal with the US Supreme Court, others are afraid of its Health system, in which we can build a complete own health profile with previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google compiles a genetic database can then serve as a good source of material even for the next generation of ski-fi writers, the famous novel Cory Doctor's "Scroogle" describes with Orwell's reminisces the future in which one can be terribly well approached only with Google data.
Double killers from Ozda helped to remove the tracks of two young people
Two young people heard the police in the event of a double homicide in Ózda, allegedly helping to eliminate the consequences of this crime, the Chief Police Officer of the Borsod County said on Tuesday.
Persons found guilty of the suspected activity and are currently accused of committing a criminal offence.
Both young people, according to MTI information two girls, are being held free.
Helping a criminal is punishable by the deprivation of liberty for up to 5 years.
Suspected of a double murder in Ózda, the 23-year-old left man, was taken into temporary custody on Sunday.
He's a suspect of a crime in advance of a several-time murder for good reason.
During the investigation it was found that the 23-year-old man owed the 53-year-old man a higher amount.
The suspect didn't want to pay off his debt, so he drove his creditor out last Wednesday to an Ozda plant where he killed his first man and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, a young man was prepared to commit a crime in advance, which he also testified to was murdering a weapon hidden at the scene of the crime.
The weapons and the circumstances of their use are investigated by the police with the involvement of experts.
Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer to buy a Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - offered a Warsaw Stock Exchange to buy a percentage package of shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish side, although the Czech Warsaw Stock Exchange had already been excluded from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell 60 percent of the securities in a few months.
According to the Czech Economic Journal E15, the Polish offer represents the highest amount that has been offered to the interest in the Prague Stock Exchange so far.
According to the Czech papers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have so far been offered.
The chief of the Prague Stock Exchange Petr Koblic said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all stakeholders, and did not exclude that it could lead to the collapse of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by experts on the stock markets at 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholders agreement, approximately 90 per cent of the shares could be resold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance's investment bank, with a share of approximately 25%, followed by the Czech escort with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a. r. l. with 13.5 per cent.
On the financial crisis from the perspective of the European Charter
In their Tuesday comments devoted to the deepening international financial crisis, the leading European lists recall "the second 11 September".
As a global financial disaster, we can thank the American President, who accuses the Roman La Repubblica. The President has not even been able to suck his own side in support of the fast-paid bill aimed at remedying this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which reminded billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could talk about the second September 11th.
Also part of the Madrid press sees the culprit in Washington.
According to the newspaper El Mundo, the world economy has led to the downturn of a lack of political leadership.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is constantly growing, and the world will pay for it.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but after the Congress vote, it is a threat that Washington will not offer a political instrument to solve the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air - just as one of the biggest changes in the history of capitalism takes place.
The threat can no longer be overlooked, says the Geneva Journal Tages-Anzeiger.
So far, individual states have been able to throw a life-saving circle at corrupting monetary institutions and taxpayers can save them from bankruptcy.
However, if other banks turn like domino cubes, then neither money nor improvisation will be enough.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to move over their national selfishness and to unite control over fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion have been granted by the giving financial institutions, according to the Vienna Der Standard, according to which they fear that, like Americans, they will have to reach deep into the pocket in order to deal with the crisis and European taxpayers, even more real.
The European Union is experiencing a crisis that, as tsunamis, is in the old continent, until it has really been forgotten.
"Savers" don't have to have billions of euros right now, but it would be good if they were to determine firmly in which case it would be reasonable to get after taxpayers' money in order to prevent even greater damage.
An intelligent car imitates the flight of a hammer
What would possibly be the best method of developing technologies capable of preventing collisions, unless the simulation of obstacles detected in the world of nature detectors?
For example, about the bee.
It is based on the strategic idea of a surprise project presented at the Japanese CEATEC trade fair, which has been designed by engineers from Nissan Chellac. It was about building a new generation of anti-fighting systems.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan designed a biomimetic robotic control system of type BR23C, a robotized mine that is equipped with the properties of bees, with the ultimate aim of helping to create a system that can eliminate all collisions.
"During the summer, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which actually looks very much like our safety protective package," explained Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of the brand for the area of technology PR and research and development.
An important role is played by complex eyes, which allow the bees to see in all directions in the corner of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the complex-eyed function, the engineers came up with the idea of a laser remote.
It identifies obstacles up to 2 metres before BR23C in the 180-degree field, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the ship's microprocessor, which is immediately turned into an operation aimed at preventing a collision.
The obstacle is caught during the break of the second, then the robot car starts imitating the movements of the bees and turning the wheels to the extent necessary to prevent the collision immediately changes the direction.
Unlike any existing system, this maneuver is carried out in an entirely instinctive manner.
"If not, the robot car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshijuki Ando, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology meets the most vulnerable and internal layer of the safety protective package, within which the impact is currently considered to be inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid the other bee.
This process must not last longer than the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot point upwards, downwards or downwards, it can only be two-dimensional and only in a direction that can be rotated around.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered to the bees when avoiding, only the possibility of reverse movement, acceleration and slowdown was applied in the case of a robot car.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means they have a longer life than lithium-iont variants.
According to Andoa, an important instinctive, intelligent reaction, not the ability to process, is less then storing data.
This mechanism must process and react only to several incoming signals per second.
It does not need to be stored and reacted using intuitive logic based on previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few kilobytes of memory at all times.
He doesn't need a memory with a giga- or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology that serves to avoid immediately, which Nissan estimated could get into a series of vehicles produced over ten years.
Another possibility of application may be to connect the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system, which, after avoiding the obstacles in the road, would lead the driver to the intended final goal.
The damn dear child already has a name
The Law on the Savings Package of $700 billion, which is to be distributed into several instalments, aimed at the purchase of poor bank loans, is already in written form.
Half of the amount will be used in the first round.
After further negotiations, which ended until Saturday afternoon of the American East Time, representatives of Congress reached agreement in a few days' debate on a saved package of $700 billion, the agency announced Reuters.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the House of Representatives, according to which there is only a record of the agreement.
The package compromise was also supported by both Presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said about the outcome of the compromise: "The programme will work and be effective, but further steps must be taken."
The written form of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets on Sunday at 8 o'clock in the evening of Washington time (i.e. on Monday at two o'clock in the morning of Central European time), but no special admission to the stock exchange was appropriate.
On the proposal for a legal standard on the name of the law on urgent economic stabilisation of 2008, which is to be established, the Commission will vote first on Monday, and then on the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosius on Saturday night, and the news of the agreement was also welcomed in the White House.
"With the progress achieved at night, we are satisfied and we highly appreciate the efforts of both sides to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," said the speaker of the White House, Tony Fratto.
The programme differs from the original proposal of the Bush administration, which was intended to cover the purchase of non-quality mortgage-backed securities of a total sum of $700 billion.
It is now possible to lose in the first round of up to half the amount of 700 billion, so that 250 billion will be used immediately after things are expected to be decided by Congress on Monday, and the Ministry of Finance will buy them valuable securities secured by mortgages that are rated as quality, the remaining $100 billion will then depend on the President's decision.
The programme will be controlled by a special congregation, which will also be chaired by the Federal Reserve Bank.
The second half of $700 billion will depend on the next Congress decision.
The Ministry of Finance may, in the sense of the law, apply a combined approach: at the same time, it can buy out non-quality loans, mortgages and securities secured by mortgages, and other "poor" loans.
The purchase may take place in the course of the auctions even directly, communicated by the competent representatives of the ministry.
The rule of law will allow the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance will provide them with guarantees of the means of causing concern and will then pay the price corresponding to the amount of the damage expected.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary means to meet the urgent requirements of the US financial system totalling up to $700 billion, whether it is a large purchase of bad money, insurance, or the prevention of systemic risk associated with the collapse of some of the large monetary institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be prepared to introduce the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the contrary, the chief banks that have got into trouble and are waiting for state aid can count on the government to lower them off - which is simply called a "golden drop" in the sea snake.
They will only be limited to certain cases, and these limits will also depend on the way in which they are provided by the Ministry.
The restriction basically means that if the ministry is to buy in the course of the auction, a tax deduction will be imposed on gold deposits unless the bank directors are sent to retirement.
In the case of direct redemption of non-quality loans, the government will aggressively step up its efforts to ensure that management money is not overrun.
It should be added that the existing gold felling contracts are not being changed, the restrictions concern only new contracts, which should be another incentive to participate in the programme.
"This is the first case in American history when the legal limitation on the remuneration of directors-general will be in force," said the chairman of the Financial Services Committee of the Representatives' House, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State in the participating banks shall have the right to a share which reduces the risk of taxpayers, as soon as the economy and the bank with it stand on their feet, they may also benefit from this transaction.
The proposal's plan includes that in the next five years, the President shall submit to Congress a proposal setting out how taxable persons expected to recover their losses from the financial sector.
Of course, there have also been votes in favour on both sides in relation to the plan of doubt.
"This is not what American citizens asked us for, because it's not the dollar of taxpayers," said a Republican congressman from California Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague from Ohia Mary Kaptur believes that the provisions were imposed on exactly those who were responsible for rocking Wall Street.

Also, domestic sales prices in the processing industry increased slightly, by 0.1 per cent, compared to July.
The biggest price increase was in August 2008 in the leather and footwear industry (2.8 per cent), mainly due to the monthly price increase in the dairy and saddlery products sector by 4.6 per cent, and in shoe production by 2.5 per cent, respectively.
A higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials has resulted in a significant monthly increase in prices in the chemical and product production sector (1.6 per cent).
Prices fell in the oil processing sector (1.4 per cent), the production of electrical machinery and equipment (0.9 per cent), as well as - to a minimum - in the wood processing sector (0.1 per cent).
Prices in paper and publishing and printing have not changed.
In other processing industries, we measured an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9 per cent.
In the electricity, gas and water production and distribution sector, which has a high share of domestic production, increased by 0,3 per cent in August, particularly with the continued effect of the officially established increase in gas prices from 1 July.
In the 12-month comparison of foreign losses in the individual processing industries, prices grew most in the oil processing industry (32.4 per cent).
In the dairy sector, 13.2% of the production of foodstuffs, beverages and tobacco products with a decisive weight could be observed, then an 11% price increase.
Prices fell in the textile and textile production sectors (2.5 per cent) and in the production of electrical machinery and equipment (0.3 per cent).
In the rest of the processing industry, price growth rates ranged between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
Overall, prices in the processing industry increased by 10.2 per cent last year.

Next year in the United States without a visa?
According to King Göncz, there is great hope that around January 12th the US-Hungarian visa-free agreement will enter into force, the foreign ministers spoke about it in Chicago in front of the local Hungarian community leaders.
According to her opinion, "now almost everything depends only if an electronic road authorisation system is established at sea in time, respectively."
At the same time, she pointed out that part of the new system would not be allowed to enter, but tourists would have to be allowed to register before leaving.
A representative of Hungarian diplomacy from today continues in negotiations in Washington.
He will meet with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Condoleezzo Rice, who will hand over the Central Cross with the Star of the Order to the honours of the Republic of Hungary and hold talks with the advisor to the foreign policy of the Presidential candidate of the Democratic Party of Barack Obama and the Republic of John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are for the bank rescue package
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of both major American parties, agreed on Sunday to provide their support to the government's bailout package of $700 billion, but there are also policies that require the demise of the finance minister.
Following the several-day marathon of the Congress and the representatives of the administration, it was announced early Sunday morning: the basic agreement on the bank's bailout package was concluded.
A financial package aimed at overhauling the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Like Obama, McCain is well-known as the most suitable candidate to bring the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest research, at the same time as the economic questions got in advance, he gained some advantage again from Obama, and McCain's jump, which he secured after the Republican Convention by appointing Sarah Palinova to the post of Vice-President.
Obama said on Sunday at a pre-election meeting in Detroit that the package law of 700 billion would quickly be adopted by Congress.
It stressed that the proposal contains passports relating to consumer protection, which it also supports.
"We must act now, with responsibility (...) to your places, savings, industry as a whole, the stability of the entire economy is at risk," said a 35,000-dollar vat.
He didn't let himself get the chance to call McCain's ideas on the economy an old man.
McCain explained in the interview with the ABC TV station: "All this will be a little bit of a talk... but nothing can be done."
As stated by the Republican Senator, the proposal includes the establishment of a commission to supervise the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the derogation for the senior representatives to which it was due.
Obama told the CBS station that McCain had no more important role to play in the negotiations, but he himself was in daily contact with the minister.
The President of the House, Nancy Pelosi, announced on Sunday that the House of Representatives would vote on the bill on Monday.
Print preview for the German language area
The right camp is intact, only voters inside it have become more self-conscious - thus analyzing the weak outcome of the CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haiderovs are prepared to rule Austria to prevent black-and-black coals.
The mirror (e.g. mirror.de)
In an online edition of the left German newspaper, Franz Walter discusses the causes of CSU's dramatic defeat in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours his father."
According to a well-known politician, CSU's erosion began about a long time before his office took over the sad Beckstein-Huber duo.
Christian socialists have been renewing Bavaria for decades - and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The Middle Ages are, therefore, the problem of the entire Christian democracy, and of the Angely Merkel.
The debate was not completely surprising for the CSU, but on Saturday the process was completed, which could have been assumed for almost ten years: it ended the indisputable hegemony of one state party.
Already ten years ago, in 1998, CSU landed 47.7 per cent, for the first time since the 1950s below the 50 per cent limit.
This was repeated three years ago in the elections to the Bundestag in 2005, which is still so often mentioned in the Stoiber period.
The reason is the modernization that CSU has consistently carried out in this country and that eats its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they have been very wrong at the pace. Secularization, educational outcomes, Germans from the east and north in the developing regions of Bavaria, however, could not have been without the consequences of the loyalty of the CSU volunteers.
Modernisation is linked to an increase in opportunities, which also has visible political consequences.
The right camp is intact, but the voters inside it have become more self-confident, more critical, more self - centered.
It is also evident that in recent weeks CSU has been the most remote in classical civil society; people in a free profession, professionals, graduates and academics.
This has already resulted in CSU's support of under 40 per cent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The Conservative Vienna Journal is entitled "Who, with whom? The President's parties are sustainable in the questions of the coalition" deals with the controversial internal political situation resulting from the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wants to deal with EVP.
The EEAS shall order the involvement of the ESDP in its internal affairs.
BZÖ appears as open to all negotiations, the greens do not yet want to guess at the coalition.
The elections are behind us, now everything is going around the coalition; in the debate organised on public television, the President's parties have not been able to look into their cards.
The President of SPÖ Werner Faymann confirmed his willingness to deal with the EVP.
And SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two sides is certainly possible - in some social countries and in the social partnership.
The question is whether he will have to present himself to the Coalition with Wilhelm Molter, the current President of the ÖVP, as deputy Chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, the Schüssel-Multererer course was re-voted at every turn.
The repetition of this direction does not take into account.
Molterer responded to the red bids carefully.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to intervene in the internal affairs of the EIA.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is still fully open, these issues need to be debated decisively within the EIA.
The President of BZÖ Jörg Haider once again appeared open in all directions.
"To prevent black-and-black coals, we are prepared to take over government responsibilities," Haider said.
Jaróková: The magic circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
In Paris today, the European Summit of Equality, which is hosted this year by France, the current President of the European Union.
Lívia Járóková, Member of the European People's Party for the Movement of Fides, as one of the main speakers of professional training in her full-time message, paid attention to the segregation of education, as it is one of the most serious injustices affecting Roma children, and also the most serious obstacle to their implementation.
The summit began - on behalf of the French Presidency - Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European organisations for the protection of rights and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities were among the invited representatives.
According to the press office of the Eurogroup of Ambassadors of the movement, Fidesz Járóková has pointed out that, in addition to the discrimination that occurs in the recruitment of the workforce, the Roma are being pushed out of the European labour market primarily because of their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma do not have secondary education and, as a result of poor quality of basic education, can achieve a higher degree of education only an integral part of it."
Yarokov further stressed that education as a fundamental human right has a key role to play in the exercise of other human rights.
Investment in early education for Roma children may mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the honourable Member, it is necessary to establish the awareness of these relationships in the broadest circles - between Roma and non-Roma children.
The sooner a Roma student starts school, the more likely he will be to become a productive member of the labour market; through income taxes and consumer taxes, they contribute to the national budget.
"Romans have the right to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their lack of quality and separate education," said Lívia Járóková.
According to the honourable Member, consistency of the European Union with the aim and the negotiations is necessary in order to speed up the process of deregregation of schools, first of all due respect for existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations.
"It is necessary to break the magic circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, to provide Roma children with opportunities for democratic space so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe," Jeróková said.
In the sense of "European Year of Equal Opportunities", everyone is guaranteed the objective of the European Summit of Equality, organised annually since last year's meeting in Berlin, to provide a separate forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and to eliminate discrimination at the level of Europe as a whole and of the individual Member States.
CSU: temporary mercy
The judgment of the debtor of the Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Even in the face of a foolish election debate, the debate on personal issues has been postponed by the spearheads of the Bavarian CSU.
The President of Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Günther Beckstein can still remain in their seats, the question is as long as this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a catastrophic 17 per cent loss of votes, will decide on the last October's extraordinary congressional weekend.
In any event, members of the highly criticised duo were told that they would not return to their positions.
They tried to calm down the angry members of the fraction and the base, who, due to the loss of the absolute majority, demanded the day after the "Bavoric tsunamis" export of personal consequences.
Five years ago - true, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the top of his career - the Christian-social union gained 60.7 percent, now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, but only 43.4 percent.
In Bavaria, CSU produced 18% of German GDP as "self-governing" over 46 years.
Nevertheless, conservationists in the southern shelf country still have a key role to play in the Hungarian economy, but in the future they will be forced into the coal.
One of the first signs of reorganisation within the party is that a member of a close team of experts, who launches the investigation negotiations on the possible coalition of the Munich government with the liberal FDP, as well as the legally oriented freelance assembly, will also be the Vice-President and the Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is considered to be a potential successor to Huber's.
It is ironic that Gabriele Pauli, whose speech against Stoiber used the Huber-Beckstein duo to execute the puja, got into the chamber, but with ambitious community policy they did an unmerciful short process.
The CSU leaders are now focusing all their energy on how Beckstein stabilizes.
During the transitional period, Stoiber will also play an active role, which has so far been the backbone, the former prime minister of the country, and the former president of the CSU called on 28 September the longest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber left a number of driving notes to the CDU, which he believed would have earned much more support from the sister side.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning for both CDU and Angel Merkel.
After the elections to the Bundestag in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become a chance chancellor if the CSU, which played a significant role in the country's success in 2005, does not, by common forces, stand on its feet.
According to Merkel, who was hard to hide her disappointment because of her failure, CSU's position will not have a negative impact on the Berlin Great Coalition.
This is, of course, relative: treating the injured CSU will not be easier and the social democrat crisis continues.
SPD achieved 18.6 per cent of the worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Luschenko: opposition - 110:0
In Sunday's elections, no opposition MP came to the Belarusian Parliament.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the prosperity and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OBSE), the illegalities that occurred when the votes were counted.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not know the elections.
Although the 110-member legislative assembly of the 10 million countries has been losing the opposition for ten years, the opposition united under the name of the United Democratic Force (ODS) before yesterday's elections really hoped that Lukashenko, who left behind the amendment of the constitution in the elections with a debate in 2006 and the fourth to renew his presidential mandate, will this time "allow" to appear in parliament several opposition MPs.
That's how ODS has abandoned the boycott before.
In the background of the opposition, Russia was increasingly heavily dependent on Belarus - which has consistently taken credit for the calming of the impact of Russian imports of natural gas and has also contributed to the fact that Beltransgaz, the owner of the gas pipelines of the country passing through, has been able to get into the hands of Russia - wanted to improve relations with the European Union, where Belarus's political establishment as an anti-democratic Lukashenko and other high-level policies do not provide entry permits.
The release earlier indicated that the OSCE had placed emphasis on positive moves in the evaluation of the pre-election campaign, and not on shortcomings - for example, on the ban of candidacy for a third of the opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's Monday lightning report has already had exceptions to the campaign, during which opposition candidates could not essentially appear in the press, especially since the opposition could not be present to count the votes.
At the same time, it is possible, according to the opposition, to feel better in the political system: political prisoners have been released for freedom, and Minsk is willing to engage with Moscow and in smaller confrontations when it continues to refuse to recognise Georgia's withdrawal of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, despite Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state, these two territories have been considered independent for a month.
"We took two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that he started a dialogue between Belarus and the EU," said our letter Alexandr Milinkevic.
According to the opposition candidate from the presidential elections in 2006, it is desirable to remain so, even though "it is too much to let one member of the opposition into the insignificant parliament".
In view of the results of the opposition, he is not planning a protest, rather trying to deliver his message to the voters on the need for economic reforms.
"With this, of course, we have a lot of problems, we have to print opposition papers in Russia, the distribution is putting obstacles to local authorities, but I see that the change is supporting as many people as possible, even among older people," said Milinkevic, pointing out that the Lukashenko regime, which considers the creation of social security as its greatest success, does not count as the right or officially the most supported level of pensioners.
"Because of the country's debt and the growth of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time when social security 'increasing silence' collapses," Milinkevich said.
Unlike the opposition policy, Russian observers have assessed the elections as democratic.
The Community’s mission of independent states, Sergei Lebedzev, Russian news agency Ria Newsti, said that “people don’t believe in words but deeds”, so the absence of opposition is nothing but evidence of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It's the first time in the history of the Chigi Palace, which was set up in the reverse door at the time of the arrival and departure of the employees.
However, from this day on, this new measure will start to work against the anointed, against those who boast and then go to coffee at work.
News against the Lenochs was reported today by the Minister for Public Administration, Renat Brunetta, and Secretary General of the Presidential Council, Maurem Masi.
"The reverse door - says Brunetta - is a tool for better work, higher performance, more presence and more services," explains the Minister.
"The new period of responsibility and transparency will be open.
It's reformism," notes Brunetta.
We will complete the establishment of the Chigi Palace in all the Presidencies of the Council.
For Masi, "the choice of reverse doors is important from a symbolic point of view".
There were no objections on the part of the employees, the Secretary-General assures us: "It was a common procedure with the workers and the cooperation of all."
In short, no breakfast at work; no coffee and croissant anymore.
Brunetta smiles and says, "Nothing better than a good cappuccino at seven o'clock in the morning."
During one conference at the University of Technology for Public Administration
in Rome, the Minister will finally announce that during three months the absence of public employees for the disease has been reduced by 50%, which means by 60,000 people per year at work."
And it adds that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more effective
"their pay dynamics, as explained by the Minister, have doubled over the last 8-10 years in terms of the private sector and are far higher than the inflation rate".
In the meantime, thousands of public employees met to reject the norms of the Brunette Decree in accordance with the request supported by Codacons.
"As the Minister for Public Administration today presents the figures for the lower absences in the work of the disease – writes the consumer protection association – the 'full-league nation' is constantly growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct employees in public administration who have gathered to declare war illegal standards contained in the decree."
In Taru, there will be protesting, in particular, against the exclusion of hospital allowances that depend on activities; the extension of the time period during which it is possible to check the time limits for inspection visits and the other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
Labour failures, Napolitano: "Resolute prevention"
Every day in Italy, 2,500 work injuries will occur, three people will die, and twenty-seven will remain permanently disabled.
The values of Inai confirm that in 2007, we have about 1,200 deaths due to work injuries.
These values testify to the seriousness of the order, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes nearly double deaths compared to murders.
In order to revitalise the attention of the institutions, social media and information about this dramatic problem, Anmil is celebrating today in all the Italian regions the national day of the victims of work impact set for the second week of October.
"The disturbing data extended by Anmil and the tragic reports of these days confirm the importance of the safety of work," says the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in a report sent to President Anmil, the National Association for Frozen and Disabled for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State shall declare his/her living widow to be a permanent joint effort on safety at work, on the protection of injured workers, on assistance to the families of the victims and on the participation of the public opinion.".
"Of course, there has been an exacerbation of 'satisfaction', an honest sharing of faces in the face of tragedies that cause disillusionment in the media and the participation of public opinion, but daily reality once again offers us dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is no doubt a problem of sources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
It is of particular importance that numerous initiatives are being taken in the field of education so that young people facing the world of work can gain a clearer understanding.
It is necessary to note this phenomenon, not to give up because of its disturbing social seriousness, to apply and improve legislative standards.
The President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber stressed that "as a result of the death of the labour force, it creates an absolutely critical social state, insults the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make a convincing effort towards the necessary end of this state."
"As regards the data of labour impact, it seems to be showing a certain positive turnaround, however, it does not deny that the number of deaths resulting from labour losses is as alarming as it is," said President Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "reduction effort" to lead to less attention, because just as the attention gets up, tragedy will explode.
"We believe that in general there is still little to stop the problem of impact and that there are many activities that may have an impact on this problem.
It is necessary, according to our opinion - Mercandelli stressed - to increase controls and inspections, but also to step up efforts in the field of training of workers, as early as school age."
"There is still a need for further efforts - he added - with regard to communication and public participation.
But there is a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards the phenomenon that is an exceptional social phenomenon."
Mercandelli has finally stated that it is a progressive degeneration of the level of right to compensation for victims of work and "removal of support care" to which the system has come in recent years."
"The aim is therefore to return the worker's insurance guarantee - he added - because the fate of those who hurt themselves must not depend on the spontaneousness or the giving of time from time to time by the legislator."
Mp3 Player Accused, Exposed Risk Hearing
Listening for a longer time to loud music and using portable music devices as Mp3 players may cause permanent hearing damage.
According to today's notice of the European Commission, which in an official report extended in Brussels cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Health Risks recently raised and identified (Csseri) Eu.
"From this scientific point of view, we read in the notes, it turns out that 5-10% of those who for at least five years listen to music using portable musical instruments, weekly more than an hour a day and keep the device high, risk a permanent loss of hearing."
"I am concerned that so many young people who often use portable music devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can hurt their hearing in an uncontrollable way," admits Meglen Kuneva.
"From scientific findings – the leader continues – there is a clear risk and there is a need to react quickly.
The most important thing is that we have to encourage consumers and publish this information.
We must continue to re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific discovery in order to become fully effective and to take steps with new technology."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine this problem in the light of the high use of portable musical instruments and the increasing number of young people exposed to the noise of this origin.
"Scientists - the executive officer of Eu - confirm that concerns need to be addressed and the European Commission will now examine, together with other members and parties that have raised the problem, what measures could be introduced if necessary and thus better protect children and young people from exposure to noise, whose origins are portable musical instruments and similar devices".
At present, there is already a security European standard that limits the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but concerns arise as to hearing damage which can be caused by excessive exposure similar to noise.
It is very possible to limit these damage by looking for solutions such as reducing the level and duration of exposure.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee of Eu states that users of portable musical instruments, if using loud music (over 89 decibels) for a period of only five hours a week, will now exceed the applicable limits corresponding to the maximum permissible sound at the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for a long time risk a permanent loss of hearing after five years.
This problem should concern 5-10% of users of such devices and their quantities can be counted between 2.5 million and 10 million people in Eu.
Rome, Germany leaves the free passage of the Commission for the future of the capital
We'll start today, we'll close in March, we'll have a sum in June.
This is the calendar given by Campidogli to workers "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which met this morning in its new residence behind Caracall's spa.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and 49 other members of the Commission will draw up handbooks for Rome.
When the door is closed in March, Giunta and the General Council will evaluate the analysis and projects so that they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official seal" Campidoglia and his adviser Gianniho Alemann in June.
"The Commission is completely independent and it includes all political, social and cultural ideas – it wants to highlight the Germanno – it will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome, which ultimately use political decision-makers who remain in Gionta e General Council.
It is not about any exchange of functions, but only about the attempt to have some place to process a large project for Rome.
Work will be completed in March and will then be dissolved, because these institutions must have an exact deadline.
In June – the mayor announces – we will present a strategic plan and use the work carried out by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome".
For those who accuse the Commission of being unnecessary because its opinions will not be binding, the German branch will say: "All depends on the work the Commission will be able to carry out and the quality of their proposals.
If they are of quality, as are the Commission's proposals Attali, and I am also sure that in Rome, its benefits will be decisive.
Too often policy will pay for everyday problems and emergencies that will arise from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to look further and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the Mayor of Rome would like to stress that "this Commission is neither a surplus business nor a bluff: it is completely free, the Roman citizens will not be even the euro and will serve to think and engage the best intelligence that the capital has".
For Germany, in essence, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan as the starting point, not a definitive or non-moveable point, so that it is possible to allow our city an authentic rise to the level it needs, and to think with the united spirit of its future."
The future, which, explains the mayor of Rome, "will not only limit itself to the current general border, but will seek much further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status, the capital city, but "will also include the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, first anti-American president.
One well-known American president wrote that it was important for him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president."
The first was Jimmy Carter, who by his decisions decimated the US economy and maintained relations (as well as today as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam."
The attacks on Obama are increasing just as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on the web: "This man is full of ambition.
But Obama is stubborn: he thinks he'll get to the highest position of a nation that has all two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, these attacks don't say a lot"; they are attacks of a clearly racial origin and they don't answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And then we have research; they all say that Obama wins with a great leap.
Even in this case, there are those who act according to the heart and not according to the brain.
A newspaper from Mississippi, from the South of the United States, wrote a comment: At least once in the polling room we know who gives his voice to the American patriot.
There's going to be one side of the American mentality that's been on fire until the last moment.
Say what you want, we'll finally take care of it by ourselves, whether Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear that if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, it seems almost certain the success of the black candidate.
But in spite of all these considerations for the democrats, George Bush is the main weapon.
The 1,500 people asked: what mistakes did Bush make during his term of office? eighty-nine percent answered: Iraq.
America's changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost fifty thousand soldiers and sent him home with the dignitaries to the ass.
In Iraq, the lives of 4,500 soldiers were seen, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet Iraq has become for most of Bush's weakness.
Whoever gets into Georgia W's place will have to do a huge job.
The U.S. Economic collapses have also been felt by journalists: there is a period of investigation in the newspapers. And many are accusing the Internet of "killer" printing.
The Pew Research Center asked five hundred journalists about the status of their profession and the assumption of the future.
Since today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the questions clearly did not indicate that they were less concerned about confidentiality.
It doesn't feel like isolation like it used to be.
The problem is for American journalists money, the money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
Besides, the jokes made in the newsroom, in the rooms where editors work to put together the newspapers, are a huge problem.
According to the journalists, this is a problem that needs to be solved if we do not want traditional journalism to change in principle, as the general public understands.
American reporters have a clear but complex pessimism.
Six out of ten press journalists and executive seniors are convinced that the newspaper is being issued on a national scale in the wrong way.
In the local area, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against breakfast.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web goes.
A larger publishing system opens the way to the Internet, which many view as a "killer" of prints.
The "economic pressure" reported by journalists has increased by 79%.
Five hundred journalists have admitted that they are lagging behind technology in the hope that for their newspaper, "something good is done".
The biggest failure in American journalism is among those who run newsrooms – which means leaders – and reporters who work for them.
56% of the leaders at the national level are confident that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the value decreases to 23%.
This has something to do with "safety of work."
Leaders who think they're losing their jobs for three years are 47% at national level.
As far as journalists are concerned, they're moving at 30%.
As for "certain work" concerning staff (our editors, ndr) in America, it is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on the contract.
In a huge nation like Usa, with three hundred million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, TVs and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, so it's a question to take or leave.
Leaders receive almost always huge salaries and the editor can also make ten thousand dollars a month without payment of pension and insurance.
As far as possible, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year until 15 days after a certain number of years.
However, American journalists, according to their own knowledge, often get sick over the course of a year.
It's just a climate issue.
UNIPOL: JUDGMENT IN ROMANIA, DENMARK DENMARK IN GROTTAFFERRATE
The President of the Second Chamber of the Roman Court, Carmelo Rinauda, decided to refuse to use the business with the realities of Daniel Coppoly, who requested that he move from his city, Grottaferraty, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankruptcy in connection with the anti-sale sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the process at its own expense, last week he received a release from the home prison, which was transformed into a forced permanent stay in Grottaferrat.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, asked that the real estate businessman could change the place of residence from the rural town to the capital.
However, according to the Court of Justice, this move (to which pm was expressed) would allow him to influence his company and to obtain evidence that he was accused of.
Elite in danger
This phenomenon occurred a few days ago, when the Committee of Representatives voted against the saving plan to provide $700 billion to the White House: a significant part of the Americans were more interested and interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
They also confirm yesterday's New York Times, which inform us that the current crisis is disbanding the Republican side, increasingly divided among its old East Coast soul, a smaller one, in contact with federal institutions and business communities, and its new one, which is, on the contrary, conservative, hostile towards the "debate from Washington" and the world of finance, strong mainly in the countries in the middle and south.
The soul that was arrogantly expressed by the vote that I was talking about at the beginning.
However, this just quoted thing is just an example of changes, big changes, which the current economic earthquake already shows: not only in the United States, but also in the whole of the west, and perhaps not just here.
Both in Usa and in Europe, it seems that this crisis acts as an accelerator for events that have been incubated for a long time, which are becoming more difficult in the new climate and ultimately light-based.
The first of these is the revitalisation, the extraordinary revitalisation of the market, the dual category of State power in relation to certain renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis is, of course, the crisis of banking financial institutions, which, of course, have strong links abroad, but which include, above all, the budgets of people and families living in one country, in the only state.
This has created at the same time a political problem for those who drive it: this means how to respond to the problems and protests of people and families who are, among other things, voters.
In short, the crisis appears economically global, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationality seems to be much out of play or to have nothing to add: clear evidence has been given by the European Union, which is always divided as between different interests and different state strategies and which cannot be decided for one common policy line.
And so everyone is waiting for the intervention of the government of each state, the rescue plans, the revitalization of the market, the new rules and, above all, the distribution of funds: when we get to the pressure, only States have the economic resources, the amount of financial resources to be able to try everything in order.
And also their own necessary means and authorization to use them: two sources of irremeable value, under certain circumstances, where no market and no international organisation will ever be able to dispose of to a similar extent.
This new emphasis, which puts the crisis on a state-national element, is still in full line with the growing importance that recent economic progress is trying to contribute to one factor closely linked to it: territorial ownership.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the kingdom of the network, more and more sophisticated technology, material, while we were convinced that global finances were already meant to rule the world, we realized from nothing that our future would have to deal more and more with such little intangible things as water, grain, oil.
However, all things that would have been said can be transported from one place to another on earth, in any case are connected, absolutely, to a restricted space, the territory.
So whoever becomes their ruler must have a lot more karats in his sleeve than he does, and who has the pity that he lives in a place without grain, without oil and without water.
I'm getting to the second newspaper that predicts evil.
Those who talk about territory, the state, the government, inevitably talk about politics, that is, leadership.
In view of the economic crisis, it seems that there are two convergence phenomena.
On the one hand, it becomes clear that there is an objective need for authoritarian leadership, a request for someone who can understand the situation.
On the other hand, the wave of discreditation towards existing leadership, particularly the economic one, has proved equally unsatisfactory and full of dark places.
And together, something even deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: discreditation, impatience, feelings of incompetence and incompetence that are trying to dominate the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
Because it seems that more and more is expanding in the broad masses of the population of the conviction than that their actions are the same as the thoughts of the popular elite, their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the right sense, that the elite has already exceeded its time and is repulsive to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership is short-lived by a single wave below the ground, but a strong movement for the removal of the ruling class and traditional political order is reflected in unexpected "refuses" or unexpected changes in collective power in the last and last days, from the conservative uprising in Austria-Bavor to the fall of Labourists in Britain, to the resistance of American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps what the victory of the right in Italy should do).
We have the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say their format, have increasingly problems understanding, that is to say, representing, which, not from today, is created in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is once again strengthening, increasing, potentially overcoming the loophole.
Before this, it would be excessive to talk about a permanent "mass rebellion".
But we certainly can't say that it means having your eyes open.
Super adhesive for walking around the walls
To overcome the laws of gravity thanks to super adhesive and in the future walk through walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of various American research centres and now the four institutions have come very close to it.
Scientists have managed to maintain a stokilogram body glued to a vertical wall with a label of only 2.5 centimeters square.
STUDIUM – The American journal Science published the findings of some University researchers in Dayton, Akron, the Georgian Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material that has been invented by the team of researchers is the development of existing materials using a special structure of carbon called carbon throttle tubes.
“We can imagine the basis of the adhesive as a series of tubes placed as an organized cluster of spaghetti” explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgian Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have inspired the legs of a gecko, covered with microscopic cloves, which allow animals to provide a perfect grip.
Tests carried out on various materials such as glass, Teflon and glass paper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these beaches and at the same time "is simply sticking away from the wall", explains Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering of Dayton University.
- "This material could be useful as a provisional adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk through the vents like Spiderman? Maybe yes, but researchers are thinking about far less fascinating use as a connection of electrical devices, because corrugated carbon tubes are conductors of heat and electrical energy.
Other applications could concern aerospace engineering .
For the time being, no super heroes.
FURTHER RESEARCH – The University of Berkley, California, is also dedicated to researching a new adhesive.
In an article in the magazine American Chemical Society, Californian scientists presented a adhesive made up of micro fibers as hair that cleanses itself from dust by moving around the surface to keep the perfect fit.
Medicines: Never with Juice
Watch out for the grape, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks that are consumed mainly in the summer because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving medicines, their use changes to enhance or reduce efficacy with serious health consequences.
For David Bailey, professor of Western Ontario University in London, highlighted the risk of juices both ready and fresh in combination with the use of some drugs, at the 263th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, a new alarm arises: one glass of grape juice, orange juice and apple juice is sufficient to reduce the consumption of some life-saving drugs, to cancel their beneficial effects and to expose patients to risk.
Grape juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing to a toxic level the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological drugs.
pharmacies at risk– The Italian medical agency itself announced this in the information bulletin two years ago and bubbling doctors and patients to avoid underestimating the risks arising from this mixture and to pay attention to what they drink in case they are taking medicines such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NEVER GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contains substances that are depleted.
A long list of the effects of grapefruit and other juices.
The call from Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan: "These findings are most immediately announced to the most diverse international and national pharmaceutical agencies, which may establish and exchange information instructions.
So always read the illustrative cards of the medicines you get and if you encounter something unclear, don’t get upset, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification” stressed an expert for Ansa.
Nobel laureate Paul Krugmans
The Nobel Prize was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his study of commercial models and location of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old Novokenyan who teaches at the University of Priceton and is a famous editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important criticisms of Bush's administration's foreign, economic and political steps.
A few months after the September 2001 assassinations, on the days when Enron broke, Krugman predicted in a comment published in the New York Times that the second event would, in the sense of the consequences of the United States history, be much more important than the first.
A prediction that caused little controversy and that was calculated after years, however, proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and shocked at the speed with which the collapses like Enron and Worldcom have disappeared from public interest," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Binho Smaghi, from the Executive Committee of the Central European Bank, Krugman is a "economy of great importance", but also a popularist who has "very aggressive style, especially critical of Bush's excessive liberalist administration".
Open Office, we have here the third edition of "anti-Microsoft"
It is the day of publication of Open Office.org 3.0, an open source personal product package that aims to penetrate more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the Microsoft Office.
After about a year's work of volunteers controlled by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with various news: to welcome the screen and to the revised and improved opening window are added another, far more important, as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
The focus is also on cooperation with the Office 2007, Open Office is able to open the document with the new Microsoft plugin (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
These are the special features of some models such as what allows to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for electronic transmission, or the possibility to transfer a PDF file to the graphical execution model and to keep the original view of the page.
From this point of view, we can still create "PDF hybrids" documents that look like typical graphics of Adobe format and have the properties of a table processor or text program.
Cooperation is an element that has achieved many improvements within the application programs: in excellent it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts of change, in the text program each employee is assigned a single color to comment to make it clearer in the audit phase.
Some companies are also working on transferring some Open Office functions to the Web (on the cloud), and in the following weeks they should stop the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, has been added to the English version, which is on the mirror since Friday.
Besides Windows and Mac OS, it is usually also available as a package for the Linux operating system.
The installation cd may also be sent at home or to the workplace upon request.
And if the free theme can be an extension to households, the Open Office's business area will be very well placed and can already be counted on with the most diverse projects implemented in public administration and in schools.
And there is no shortage of training, consultation and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacement Word; Calc is a table processor that is aimed at replacing Excel; Impress for presentation similar to PowerPoint; Dbase, as in the case of more famous Access, is a program that allows working on databases; Draw, at last, is a graphic model.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads, and when we consider that to date we are almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of a new version, it is possible that this number is even overcome.
Also the results of the Coal are positive, it's the fourth case of doping
A new positive case on the last Tour de France: this is about Rakking Bernhard Kohl, from the Gerolsteiner team, third-class and winner of the best top shirt.
The report was quoted by L'Equipe.
The 26th year of Kohl is the fourth positive racer on Cera, Epo third generation, after Italy Rickcard Ricco and Leonard Piepoli and German Stefan Schumacher, and he from Gerolsteiner.
The results of the blood samples of the Coal fall into those carried out in the last weeks by laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the control analyses confirm the positiveness of Cera, Rakušan will lose third place on the Tour and will have to face the specified two years of disqualification.
The report on the positive impact of Kohl on the third generation confirms the French anti-doping agency's chief Pierre Bordry, who announced that he had already reported the results of the Austrian government.
The 26-year-old Rakušan won the Spanish Carlos Sastrem and American Cadel Evansema, also won a scored best-class shirt.
Immigrants: New York Times looking for is italia racist?
Italy "as an immigrant country only in the last house has become a priority target for immigrants" adopted with resistance.
It turns this beautiful country into a racist nation? So it is in one long article in the New York Times, which devoted this article to a debate on racism in Italy, and started with the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, because he stole a box of dried meat.
This case illustrates what the New York Times define as the "north paradox": the northern areas are at the same time those where "more integration and more work" is registered, but also "the strongest anti-movement thinking in the country and the strongest support of the Northern League".
To confirm the increasing tension between Italy and immigrants, NYT cites cases of intolerance from Milan, Parmy, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
It's not just that.
The new legislation required by Lego, which seeks to slow down immigration and facilitates the harassment of illegal immigrants, is also cited as an example of the changing climate in Italy.
The trend highlighted both by the pope and by the president of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting Benedette XVI in Quirinale, asked the state and the church to work together to defeat racism".
Students of victims of expensive rentals - up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students doesn't know the crisis.
According to the latest research, Sunia, tenants' committees, a single room can be rented by a student in Milan up to 900 euros, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
"He has already reached such dimensions that all the classes of students have lost the right to study because of the overall too high prices that their families would have to bear – explains the head office for Sunia, Laura Mariani – a large demand in this city has deformed the market in such a way that it has stimulated the growth of prices that has spread to residents."
In most cases, rental offers contain several offences: contracts in a free way, unregistered, without a limited lease, with the associated purchases.
For Sunji, there is a need for an exceptional measure that could regulate prices through tax revision.
If we look at the details of the research, we will see that in Milan, in the area of Brianza, there is a need for one bed of about 450 euros, for a single room from the minimum price of 650 (Bande Nere area) over the average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) up to a maximum of 900 (Vittoria area).
In Florence there is one bed on average 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the university, there is a €250/280 per bed in double room, from 370 to 500 in single room.
In Rome in central university areas (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros for a single room, 450 beds in a double room.
Values are slightly lower (EUR 550 per single unit) in areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecitta).
We will save only if we move to peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 per single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and so on.
In Naples there is a stay of 300/450 euros, a room of 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the areas Policlinica, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari they want for a bed 250/350 euro, at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities prices are certainly lower, but they have a greater impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities like Perugia, where it is the most common phenomenon for students from countries outside the European Union, there is finally another anomaly: an increase of about 25-30% of the fee they want after foreign students compared to Italians.
Good-bye to the old cinema Paradisa, cities are destroying historic halls
Cinematographic historical halls are closed in favour of Multiplex.
"The city without a movie is like blind, it's like a face without an eye."
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornator successfully documents what is happening in large Italian urban centres, as well as rural towns.
The process of limiting cinemas, the production of large multi-salts in the suburbs and the subsequent destruction of mono-salts in the central areas of cities is one of the events that seem inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the signs of a real cultural crime.
Often the historical places are filled with memories," it's as if we lost a friend, a friend with whom we shared a piece of road and a lot of emotions," says the director of the New Cinema Paradiso, a film that was awarded to Tornator Oscar 20 years ago and a great jury price in Cannes, who told the poetry of a village cinema and the sadness of the way of life that he lost forever.
The values received by Anec, the main association of operators, are clear: in the last five years, 316 kins of traditional type have been closed, and the highest account has been paid mainly by halls in the most important cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the region's most affected closures is the loss of 82 China halls in the first place, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And proof that the first to blame for their miscarriage is the rise of multiplex, these three Italian regions that have registered the highest number of new cinemas: 195 pay more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian procedure has developed unnaturally," says Paolo Protti, President of Anec, "it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to ensure that existing ones survive, because when one movie closes in the city, not all of his visitors are willing to move into multiplex.
Then we do not even talk about insufficient funding for operators: the previous state debt is about EUR 10 million.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
Support for the sector would require between EUR 16 million and EUR 18 million annually.’
An interesting case is the Bologna case, the first Italian city to worry about the closures and which decided to find the eastern sign of the protocol between the municipalities and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas, both in historic centres and in suburban areas.
The planned standards include tax incentives for operators and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to travel to a restricted transport zone and will have special prices to stop and at some parking lots.
"I like this initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, and I hope that the other cities will follow the example of the Bologna implementation of other measures."
However, it is certain that in order to be able to stand against the great power of multiplex, traditional halls need to improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more demanding.
The protection of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important: the closure of the Super Cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and my adolescence, was a light that convinced me to set up the "New Cinema Paradise", which I have been thinking about for 10 years.
I've been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I've been going through front of the Rialts or Quirinals in the street of Nazionale, where I've shared so much emotion that I don't have to look at the writings of black work, I turn to the other side."
Association between politics and Mafia group 'andrangeta, Mayor Gioie Tauro in prison
"The old man from Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust the election of the City Office according to the interests of the Mafia group Piromalli".
The accusations made by the Calabria Anti-Mafia Directorate against the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioie Tauro Giorgi Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the mayor of Rosarn Carl Martelli, imprisoned this morning for external cooperation with the Mafia organization, are difficult.
In the railways also Gioacchino Piromalli, an old mediator between the clan and public administration, and his grandson, a lawyer, the name of the chief, who has already been accused of committing mafia crimes, sentenced to EUR 10 million.
"They ignored all legal and moral standards, as well as sound reason," states representatives wrote when two local authorities expressed their willingness to pay counsel to the lawyer Pyromalli.
"This would allow the Mafia group – the judges – to officially enter the city authorities and thus facilitate such enormous possibilities of control and management of public administration."
The President of the Agazio Loiero Regional Commission of the Calibrian Region does not hide that "secret agreements between local institutions and organised crime sub-worlds are many in his country: "There are areas in which the concentration of the mafia is stronger than in others where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressures of 'andraghets, heroes who are still unwarranted'."
The arrests from this morning follow the arrest of July last year , by which the police showed that the Mafia group of Piromalli had received a final attack .
Since the end of April last year - the city council of Gioi Tauro has been dissolved since 1991, the reason for this is that the link between organised crime and local administration has been assumed - local policies have been removed in the general government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, President of Christian Democrats, who was elected head of the right-wing coalition in May at the time of the dissolution.
He yelled about the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the general council to be dissolved.
He called for the responsibility of the then Deputy Minister of Interior Marc Minniti and accused him of having founded everything for political reasons, but the judges in the prison regulation signed this morning explain that the Mafia group has reached even so far that it has requested a change to the A3 project.
From the other polls directed at Dal Torrión, the public prosecutor, announced "the willingness to move the demands of the entrepreneur, representatives of some larger groups very close, as is generally known, to the Piromallim and to adapt the public administration elections to the interests of the Mafia group."
When the energy comes from the waves, they get into the game big.
It is an infinite deposit that covers more than 70% of the earth’s surface and is now being discovered by large world energy companies.
Waves, currents, flow, flow are new sources of inexhaustible energy, on which the sight of wheels like Chevron is now trying to stretch hands on these sources.
The possibility of generating energy from the sea's movements has been studied for over a hundred years and in the 1970s in connection with the first oil crisis has intensified research.
When the price of oil dropped around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went side by side, but now the environmental organization and the new increase in the price of oil gave the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 announced that about 15 per cent of the world’s electricity consumption could be covered by the use of waves of the sea.
This quantity would be double the amount of energy currently produced in nuclear centres.
In addition, there are streams and streams and streams.
The giants are attacking.
Enersis was the company that installed the marine energy plant in 2005 and agreed to build the facility in northern Portugal.
When this intention was declared, it seemed to be a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of betting on marine energy, more and more companies are investing in marine energy than in traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology – a spokesperson for one company that is connected to the US oil chain in the Wall Street Journal's economic daily newspaper – and is thinking about the possibility of working with us."
The cooperation we are considering concerns obtaining permission from the US Energy Commission, which is necessary for the deployment of the project for the use of marine energy in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially when we consider that it is in Alaska that it is still oiling and President Bush has recently come up with a plan for a new turn.
In addition to Chevron, they are tracking the traces of marine energy as well as Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey and the amounts invested so far, even though they are not fully known, they show an increasing interest among observers.
Technology, keru needs to be developed.
Experts are talking about technology, which is still in the beginning, because they don't know what impact the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
Meanwhile, facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small and do not seem to cause major problems to the ecosystem.
For greater energy production, technology with a greater impact on the media needs to be used.
Methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of battles that are connected with each other.
The force of the wave, which moves with the battles up and down, is changed by means of the wars and cylinders at hydraulic pressure inside these battles.
The pressure dilutes the turbine that delivers energy to the generator.
Energy is being delivered on the coast by submarine cables.
For the time being, in the project phase, there are four devices of this type that wait only for federal approval and part of the energy could serve for military purposes.
On the contrary, Verdant Power is already producing energy for the shopping centre and parking lot using six pdmoróir turbines in New York's East River.
The movement of water during the flow and flow causes the rotation of turbines that the generator lives on by this rotational movement.
Verant stated that they have a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorization to use this energy.
After waves, after floods, and after floods.
Special interest at this time deserves the potential of the feed and feed, they say in the Institute for Electricity Research.
Although this is an unrelated factor, flooding and flooding are more predictable than wind, sun or wave, and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
Just into the energy supply and flow of states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, with other coastal states, they have already invested 7 and half million dollars in 2008 and predicted investments of up to 35 million dollars for 2009.
