White: tower in a1, foot in b6, king in c8. Black: foot in a7 and b7, king in a8, bishop in b8. Whites put the opponent in zugzwang playing the tower in a6, after which the blacks will have only two options: take the tower in a6 or play your bishop for any other house in the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, whites move their foot from b6 to b7 and die. In the second situation, the white tower takes the foot near a7, with the same result.
