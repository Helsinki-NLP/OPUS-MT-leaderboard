You are the time of the end.
So really hang one degree.
You are not really a fool.
You are welcome.
You are very impatient with me.
You are the man to whom I now need you.
You're still. Isn't that right?
Hast thou business, O Ziha, that thou awakest out of thy sleep this day?
Please.
It's worth it.
Let your work and your labor be before your family.
the first year of your garden,
Thy hair should be cut off.
Let your heart be free. Only have the strength to take hold of it.
He that smiteth the heart, he that liveth, and he that is a bird, shaketh it.
Your officers only keep your own opinions.
Your visible body will be sold for a day, and will die.
And thy merchants were by this measure.
Your time is fulfilled.
Thou shalt acknowledge corruption.
You shall seek your father's guidance, and shall do it.
It is better to not set a seal before him.
You need to take some rest.
You have to go. You have to cut down your vine.
You ought to have kept it secret.
You have to keep your mouth shut.
You weren't able to stand. You did it in vain for my sake.
But if any man ought to have respect for money, let him have respect for him.
You must first make a defense.
You shall keep your gifts.
Thou shalt speak all things that thou thinkest.
You must tell him the truth.
Thou shalt prosper in thy ways.
You must work hard.
As ye have occasion to desire, even so shall ye also obtain.
Thou trustest men exceedingly.
You two are truly kind.
Keeping a small eye.
Thou shalt see the tambourine.
You're done.
Wouldst thou speak freely unto me?
We have been foolish to draw near to thee: therefore will we give thee the end of the time.
You will be able to read this book in the coming year.
Thou shalt not soon think of him any more.
You will understand it with the passing of time.
You will write a letter.
Ye have not quieted him to such an one.
You don't give him that which is good, but you give him that which is bad.
