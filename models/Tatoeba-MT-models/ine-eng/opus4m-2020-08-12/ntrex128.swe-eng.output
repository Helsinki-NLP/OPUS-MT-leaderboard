AM in Wales is anxious to "stand up like a puckon"
Some AM members of the Wales National Assembly are confused about a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Wales Parliament).
The proposal is intended to change the name of the national assembly to the Wales Parliament.
AM across the political spectrum is concerned about being punished.
An AM for Labour said his group was worried because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers who cannot Welsh: Twp means stupid in Welsh and pwp means bajs.
An AM for Plaid said that the group in general was "unsatisfied" and proposed other options.
A conservative waleser said his group was "open" for the name change, but pointed out that it was a short step from MWP to Mupp.
In this context, W in Welsh is expressed as the letter U in English in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drawing up legislation for the amendment, said: "The final decision on what members of the assembly should be called is so clear to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the result of a public consultation on the proposals, which found strong support for calling the Wales Parliament.
The current title for AM was proposed by the Commission by Welsh Parliament Members (Members of the Wales Parliament) or by WMP, but MWP received the largest support in a public consultation.
AM obviously proposes other options, but problems with reaching a consensus may cause problems for Presiding Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the amendment within a few weeks.
The legal basis for the amendments also includes other changes to the functioning of the assembly, including rules for the disqualification of an AM and the design of the Committee system.
AM may vote on what they should be called when they discuss legislation.
Macedonia conducts a referendum on the change of the country's name
On Sunday, voters shall vote on whether to change the country's name to "Nordic Macedonia".
The referendum is an attempt to put an end to a dispute that has taken place in several decades with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the neighbouring country's name represents a claim in its territory and has repeatedly protested against its attempt to become a member of the EU and NATO.
President Gjorge Ivanov of Macedonia opposes the referendum on the name change and has said that he will ignore the outcome.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the name change is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin's silence when the churches in Harlem hit on problems
"Old people I speak to say there was a bar and a church on every corner before," said Mr. Adams.
"There isn't either."
He said it's understandable that the bars are disappearing.
"People are surrounded in other ways for the time being," he said.
"Bars are no longer like the living room of the area, where people go on a regular basis."
He is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not be enough as long as the leaders expect and that "before or after they arrive on the route again".
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartments filled with property filled with people who do not help the remaining churches.
"The absolute majority of people buying apartments in the buildings will be white," he said. "This will eventually lead to all churches being closed, because those moving into the apartments will probably not become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original White Methodist Assembly moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation with a church nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shops on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or drive black people.
The building was seriously damaged in a fire in 1939, but when pastor Johnson’s congregation planned the renovation, they also built the clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's, proudly called the music game "the poor watch".
The expert who played the game in July had another name for it: "A cultural tax" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world's first watch game played by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind, who moved on to the largest game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's wasn't replacing him.
The events of the last few months at St. Martin's are a complicated story with architects and entrepreneurs – some of which were enlisted by the church's ambience, others by the episcopal foundation.
The church council – the governing body of the congregation consisting of bodies – wrote to the foundation in July and expressed concern that the foundation would "try to transfer the cost" to the church council, although the church council had not been involved when the foundation hired architects and entrepreneurs.
Some members of the congregation complained about a lack of transparency from the Foundation.
Sharks harm 13-year-olds who dive for lobsters in California
On Saturday, a shark attacked and damaged a 13-year-old boy who drowned for lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to officials.
The attack took place immediately before seven o'clock in the morning, near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had come with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and paddled there with a group of others to pull him out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the boy was just happy to have found a lobster, but then he realized that the boy shouted, "I've been bitten!"
"I've been bitten!"
When Hammel came to the boy, he noticed that the whole keybone had been torn up.
"I called everyone to get out of the water. 'There's a shark in the water!' said Hammel.
The boy was sent to the Council of Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition was stated critical.
It's unclear which shark it was.
Bath guard Larry Giles told the media that a shark had seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been established that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim suffered trauma from his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are over 135 sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sciencebury's enters the British beauty market
Sciencebury's takes on Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with goods-like beauty walks with beauty specialists.
As part of a significant push into the UK’s beauty market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow despite the fall of the fashion and household market, the larger beauty walks will be tested in 11 shops across the country and implemented in several shops next year if they are successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of a quick purchase attempt to fill the shelves previously picked up by TV sets, microwaves and household products.
Sciencebury's said they're going to double their beauty offer up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing offers from L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees will also have more space with selected areas, such as shops such as Boots.
The store chain also relaunches its boutique brand so that most of the products are vegan – more and more young customers require.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test stand in two Sainsbury's stores – the first stand opened in Croydon in South London last week and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the trend to buy smaller quantities of food every day in local stores means that fast shopping needs to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that their stores will look more and more like a warehouse in an attempt to fight cheap shops like Aldi and Lidl with more services and other products than food.
Sainsbury's has Argos stand in hundreds of shops and has also acquired a number of Habitat stand since they bought both chains two years ago, which they believe has increased the sales of food and made the acquisition more profitable.
The earlier attempt to give the beauty and pharmacy departments a facelift failed.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a dispute about how the revenues from Boot's sales in the fast purchases would be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business with 281 shops to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
They claim that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding a wide range of luxurious skin care products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial manager, said: "We have given our beauty walks a new look and a new feeling to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can advise customers.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet all needs, and with an appealing environment in soft places, we are now a charming beauty destination that challenges the old way to shop."
Peter Jones "rescue" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the deal of £11 million
Dragon's De-star Peter Jones is "breathing" that the TV representative Holly Willoughby withdraws from a deal of £11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't run with their brand True, with leisure clothes and accessories.
Their activities have been compared to the Gwynet Paltrows Goop brand.
This morning's representative, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragon's Den star Peter Jones angry by withdrawing from their lucid lifestyle brand in the last minute – to focus on their new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became "raising" at an exciting meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday when the TV favorite admitted to her new deal – worth up to £1.5 million – meant that she no longer focused on their brand True, with leisure clothes and accessories.
The business has been compared to Gwynet Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated assets of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced that she left True on Instagram, Jones flew to one of his holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was clearly Holly's top priority.
It would be her long-term future for the coming decades.
Her decision to withdraw shocked all who were involved.
No one could believe it happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a stock full of goods ready to be sold in Marlow's headquarters."
Experts believe that this morning's representative's decision to withdraw may cost the company several million due to significant investments in everything from pillows and lights to clothing and the risk of further delays in the launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
My mother-in-law Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started with Capp 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role as president in March.
The couple holiday together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host to "I'm a Celebrity" on ITV.
A source near Jones said last night, "We're not commenting on his business."
Hard talk "and then we fell in love"
He joked that the media would criticize him for a comment that some would consider to be "unworthy a president" and that he was so positive about North Korea's leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in a "newsman's voice":
"I haven't given up anything."
He said that Kim wanted a second meeting after Trump hailed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have come to an end.
More than three months after the meeting in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the leaders of the UN General Assembly last Saturday that North Korea did not see a "response" from the United States after North Korea's first divestment.
He noted that the United States instead continues sanctions intended to maintain the pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his followers.
"It's going great with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a sovereign relationship."
He said his attempt to improve the relationship with Kim has had positive results – an end to rockets, freed hostages and returned the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this full-packed arena, we would have around 200 people here," said Trump and pointed out to the audience in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes destroy the island of Indonesia, hundreds of deaths
After the earthquake at Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were told not to need them.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population had lost their homes, it was not granted an exemption, which was necessary for international assistance.
"In many cases they have unfortunately been very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, which complicates the whole," said Ms. Sumbung.
Saving children gathers a team to go to Palu, but it is still unclear whether foreign personnel can work there.
Mr Sutopo, spokesperson for the Natural Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu in order to determine whether international organisations should be allowed to participate in the aid work.
In view of the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is still sadly unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Tsunami protection has been built in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastlines.
The absence of a tsunami warning virus in Palu, although a warning had been issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even under perfect conditions, it is a challenge to travel between many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters complicate logistics further.
A hospital vessel that has been anchored in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on the promises of improving Indonesia's wear infrastructure in his election campaign and has spent considerable amounts on roads and train tracks.
But lack of funding has plagued Mr. Yoko's administration before next year's election.
Mr. Joko is also pressed by the delaying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows, and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge booked in the last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute of Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri around 30 meters from Chelsea's goal when his team was left with 1-0.
He transferred the ball to the left and swiped a trigger against the outside pillar.
The attempt flew high above the target area towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell over Kepa Arizabalag's hope and ended up online.
"I was just trying to get in a position to get to the ball and players that Shaq always plays forward as much as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante getting close and I didn't think about it that much but just fired."
Chelsea led by 1-0 after the first half after a goal in the 25th minute from the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue stripe waved a pass back to Mateo Kovacic, spinning from close to the middle field and sprinted to the Liverpool side.
Kovacic made a quick give-and-go at the middle field.
Then he got a sovereign kick that led to Hazard into the target area.
Hazard ran away from the defense and got the ball in the net at the outside column with a left footed kick past Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool fights against Naples in the group stage of Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 15:00 on Wednesday.
Chelsea faces videoton in Uefa Europa League in London at 15:00 on Thursday.
The death rate for tsunamis in Indonesia increases to 832
The death rate for the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country's disaster agency early Sunday.
Many people were reported to have stuck in the casinos of buildings torn in the 7.5 earthquake that hit Friday and triggered waves up to six meters, said the bureau’s spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was full of ruins from ruined buildings.
Police arrest, 32, suspected of murder after a woman was killed
A murder attempt has started after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 with a knife wound on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
The police have asked people in the area who saw or heard anything coming forward.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "We are at an early stage of the investigation, but I ask everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious about contacting us.
I also ask all, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with a car camera to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman found lives in Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
During the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the place to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police inform the victim's nearest relative.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but the police said no one can get in or out of the building.
He became aimless when he found out what had happened.
The residents of the building have been informed that it takes several hours to get back in.
A police assistant told a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared on the spot.
She says "it's so terrible" over and over again.
At 14:00, there were two police cars in front of the lockdown and another just outside.
A number of police assistants were inside the lockdown with an overview of the apartment building.
Persons with information are asked to send a DM to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and enter log 247 from September 30.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell's latest victims of the crisis over the rewriting of history
A curse would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal for "dearness" and "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be involved in the ongoing debate on the removal of statues."
The icon class during the English civil war was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Bad Cromwell might be offered for what his grandfather Thomas did 100 years earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell shows the view of the 1800s and is part of the history of a man that many still consider should be praised.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more at the end of the 1800s than now, consider that Cromwell defended Parliament against pressure, in his case from the monarchy.
If this is a proper representation, it is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
But the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has undoubtedly affected the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known person who represents one side of the matter.
His companies as the Lord's Protector also deserve to be celebrated and celebrated.
Murderer pig kills farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, who is only identified with his last name Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood in a market path in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig breeder prepares to inject the vaccine into pigs in a pig pighouse on 30 May 2005 in Xining province of Qinghai, China.
He is reported to have traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a nearby pighouse was open.
He said there was a big pig in the pighouse with blood on his mouth.
A legal investigation confirmed that the 250 kg pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and twisted," said the cousin identified with the last name Wu to Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera filmed Yuan when he came to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the farmer didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to avoid more attacks while the police collected evidence on the spot.
The Yuan family and the market leaders are reported to negotiate compensation for his death.
It is rare that pigs attack people, but it has happened before.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and seriously injured the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300 - pound [300 kg] pig pressed a farm in Wales against a tractor until his wife scared it away.
When a farmer in Oregon became eating his pigs in 2012 a farmer in Manitoba told the CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "catalyst".
"They're just playful.
They're names and they're very curious, they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect," he said.
Residues of the Hurricane Rosa for widespread heavy rain to the southwest USA
As expected, the hurricane of Rosa becomes weaker as it travels across cooler waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring floodwaters to northern Mexico and southwestern USA in the coming days.
Rosa had a wind power of up to 135 km/h, category 1, at five EST on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a tug begins to form across the Pacific and travels east towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical moisture into the southwestern USA.
Rosa will take up to 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture interacting with the approaching thirst will create vastly strong rain in the southwestern USA in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, mud streams and possibly earthquakes in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to 5 to 7.5 cm of rain per hour in certain places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5-10 cm of rain is expected in some places in the southwest USA, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the widespread tropical rain.
It is absolutely not recommended that anyone go out in the desert to foot when tropical rain is expected.
Heavy rain can make canyons to flood and ash storms lead to strong local winds that blow around sand.
The approaching tide brings with it, of course, local heavy rain to parts of southern California's coastline.
It is possible with a total of more than one cm of rain, which can lead to canvas flows and narrow roads.
This would be the first rain in the area during the rainy period.
Some shining tropical rains will approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain will be extended later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to Four Corner on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
October may mean intense temperature changes throughout the United States, when Arctic cools down but the tropicals remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic short-range temperature changes.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in Central USA on Sunday.
There is almost a ten degree difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
During the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Large parts of Central and Eastern USA are expected to have a warm start in October with around 30 degrees from Great Plains to parts of the North-East USA.
New York could get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about five degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a great opportunity for warmer temperatures than the average in the east of the United States during the first half of October.
Over 20 million looked at Brett Kavanaugh's interview
More than 20 million watched the arresting of Thursday's testimony from Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court, and Christine Blazey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, on six television networks.
In the meantime, the political state of death continued and the normal broadcast was interrupted for Friday's last minute-twist – Arizona Senator Jeff Flake's deal with the FBI where they had a week to investigate the charge.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh had painted on her when she was full and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate witness and said he was absolutely sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers on Friday was higher than the 20.4 million reported by Nielsen.
They calculated the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available for other TV networks that showed the survey, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble counting people looking from the office.
Similarly, there are as many spectators as for a football game in the final game or Oscarsgalan.
Fox News Channel, whose representatives have shown strong support for Kavanaugh's nomination, had most viewers with an average of 5.69 million in the day-to-day interview, according to Nielsen.
ABC next had a maximum of 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still high after the interview.
Flake was focused during Friday's drama.
After the Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS filmed demonstrators who shouted at him when he tried to take a lift to a hearing with the Judiciary Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down on the floor for several minutes while the demonstrators shouted at him, as shown in direct transmission by CNN.
"I'm right in front of you," said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
They also said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors were closed, he said he would have more to say after the committee hearing.
The TV networks broadcast live hours later when the Judiciary Committee voted on whether they would continue Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote with the whole Senate.
But Flake said that he was only going to do it if the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee during the coming week, which the minority Democrats have been working on.
Flake was partly convinced by his friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had a major impact, since it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political games" around Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "political games" about the future of Britain and to undermine the interests of the nation in an interview with the Sunday Times.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that the proposal for UK and EU to collect each other's customs duties was "completely unreasonable".
Shooting of Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspected Dyteon Simpson for the death of the LSU player
The police have arrested a suspect of the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Diteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and put in custody for murder, the Baton Rouge police said.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
The police found the glass eyes on the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After an interview with Simpson, the police said he admitted he killed Wayde.
His debt was set at $350,000, according to the Attorney.
The doctor at East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report Friday, which said that the cause of death was a bullet wound in the head and in the neck.
The police thank Louisiana State Police for their efforts, the police's state law lab, the Southern University Police and the residents of the area for their assistance with the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU's athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "flight and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1,98 meters long forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "broken" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"You're worried about this all the time," Wade said.
Volcano asking for ashes over Mexico City
Aska from the Volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern part of Mexico's capital.
National Center for Disaster Prevention warned in Saturday Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity had been detected in the crater and the registered 183 emissions of gas and ashes over 24 hours.
The center discovered several women and scissors.
Pictures of social media showed thin stocks of ash on windshields in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano, which is 72 km south-east of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police meet with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the vote of independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence demonstrators met with the crew police while thousands of people participated in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarising vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists held back by the Krallall police threw eggs and colored powder on them, leading to dark dust on the streets that are usually full of tourists.
Battles broke out later during the day, and the police used their batons to stop them.
For several hours the independence groups called "never forget, never forgive" while the unionists called "long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor damage caused by the protests, according to local press.
The parliament is still tense in the region that longs for independence one year after the referendum on the first October which was considered illegal by Madrid but praised by Catalan separatists.
A vast majority voted for independence, but participation was low when most of those who opposed the session boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes yesterday when the police tried to stop the vote at states in the region.
Self-reliance groups camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was still taking place, but another route was forced.
The electrician Narcis Termes, 68, took part in the separatists' protests with his wife and said he no longer believed that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last night we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy of being able to vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal gain in regional elections in December, it has been difficult for Catalan parties who are for independence to keep up the drive this year, as many of their most well-known leaders live in self-imposed exile or are in prison waiting for trial on their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on her cell phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It gets more and more excited," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been imprisoned since the end of last year, announced that he is going to be a candidate in the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"Candidateing the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the subjugation we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men seized after the car drove into the house
Three men — 33, 34 and 39 — have been arrested after driving a car into a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent, around 19:30 BST on Thursday.
Criminal Inspector Bob Blemmings said the cracks and the building itself were damaged.
An armrest may also have been fired against the car.
Manga gives Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured profits
Livingston shocked Rangers and sentenced Steven Gerrard to his second loss of 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox Club.
The Dolly Mengas strike turned out to be the difference when Gary Holt's side was divided into two with the Hibernian.
The Gerrards side has still not won a prize in Premiership this season and meets Hearts, with eight more points, next Sunday.
Before it welcomes Rangers Rapid Vienna in Europe League on Thursday.
Livingston extends its winning to six matches – chief coach Holt has still not experienced a loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses opportunities for visitors across the country
Holt's law should have taken the lead long before they made their goals; their justice gave Ranger every possible problem.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his performance across the target, and then Alan Lithgow could only shoot the board after he had slipped in to measure Craig Halket's scratching across the target.
The home team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of them, as they knew they could attack in certain games.
And that's how the decisive goal was made.
Rangers gave up a fresh park and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to give Menga a chance, which made targets from the middle of the target area.
At the time, Rangers had dominated the ball, but the home team's defense was indispensable and the target guard Liam Kelly was left largely in peace.
The same pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Ranger's target guard Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot a board from another set of Livingston's games.
Crossings came constantly into Livingston's target area and were handled without problems. Two penalties – after Halkett's challenge by the Glenn Middleton and one for hands – were dismissed.
Livingston Phenomenal – Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and results for Livingston.
Each one was outstanding and continues to exceed expectations on the way up.
Their game style and staff have hardly changed since they returned to the top level, but Holt deserves the honor of galvanizing the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding and led a well-organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall right through.
But Rangers lacked inspiration.
They've had their moments during Gerrard, but they didn't live up to the standard.
Their last ball did not hold – they only opened the home page once – and it is one of the alarm clocks for Rangers, located in the middle.
Erdogan receives a mixed welcome in Cologne
Saturday offered a smile and blue sky (29 September) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany shared breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany – which will repair the relationship between NATO allies.
They have become indifferent to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed that they prevented 25 000 spectators from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters were gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurdish – also heard their voices and condemned both Erdogan's police and the German government's decision to welcome him to Germany.
The duplicating protests show the split views of a visitor who is considered a hero of some German Turks and is condemned as a single-winged warrior of others.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist dies in a crack with a car
A cyclist has died in a crack with a car in London.
Crocken took place near the crossing of Beswood Street and Evelyn Street, a well-dried road in Deptford in southeastern London, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and the nurses were called there, but the man died in the spot.
The hook takes place a few months after another cyclist died in an infection accident on Children Street, about 1.5 km from the hook on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said they were trying to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
Roads have been blocked and buses have been redirected and drivers are asked to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guards Damaged in Tumult
Six prison guards have been injured in anxiety about a high-security prison for men, according to Prison Office.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST on Sunday and are still on.
Specialized "tornaguards" have been called there to deal with the concerns, involving eight prisoners on a plane.
The guards were treated on site for minor facial damage.
A spokesperson for Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been sent there to handle the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those behind this will be referred to the police and may receive increased prison sentences."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison was treated at the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last night, Krall police were called to the prison to deal with serious concerns where staff were attacked with billiards.
Orkanen Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (dry areas can be useful)
It is rare that tropical low pressure reaches Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the hurricane of Rosa's remaining energy is flowing across the deserts in the southwest of the United States, with a risk of sudden flooding.
National Weather Service has already issued alerts for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and bring rain late on Monday.
National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "twenty tropical cyclones have maintained status as a tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an hurricane within 65 km of Arizona border".
National Hurricane Centers latest models predict 5–10 cm of rain, with isolated quantities up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other parts of the deserts in the southwestern USA, including central Klippiga mountains and Great Basin, are likely to receive 2.5–5 cm of rain with a risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas without risk of sudden flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Floods are very serious, but some of the rain is likely to be useful because the Southwestern United States suffers from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, over 40% of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the next highest category, reported weather.com.
The Orkan Rosa will first travel across the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still with force in the morning of Sunday with maximum wind strength of 135 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is travelling north for 20 km/h.
The storm hits slower waters in the Pacific, which calms it down.
It is therefore expected now to be Mexico’s rural mass as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Parts of Mexico can get heavy rain, which is a significant risk of flooding.
"Total 7,5-15 cm of rain is expected from Baja California to the northwest Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm", weather.com reported.
Rosa will then travel north over Mexico as a tropical storm and reach Arizona’s early Tuesday morning border as a tropical low pressure, which will then travel through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger from Rosa and its remaining energy is very strong rain in Baja California, the northwest Sonora and the desert in the southwest USA," said the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and floods in the desert, as well as earthquakes in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old have been arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and the situation is reported to be "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds, and a 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, police in Avon and Somerset said.
The police ask anyone who may have filmed what happened to the cell phone to step forward.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "led, evil, evil" from the Democratic Party
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the carelessness and scandalous tactics of the democratic party," Trump told his supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered "the evil of evil" from the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before the convention on Thursday and strongly and sensibly denied Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he was sexually angry with her several decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified before the Congress about his accusation.
The President said on Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliant and the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most capable legal senses of our time, a lawyer with a first-class history of serving the public," he told his followers in the audience in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republicans voting in the forthcoming mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm running," he said.
"That's why I go around and fight for sovereign candidates."
Trump claimed that the democrats are trying to "stand up and prevent".
The first final vote of the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place on Friday, according to information to the CNN from an assistant to an older Republican leader.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, number of increases
At least 384 people died, many were swept away when giant waves crashed against the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six meters high waves crashed against the beach in the foam and turned many out to a safe death and destroyed everything on their way.
Tsunamine came after an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the tsunami warning came yesterday, people stayed on the beach instead of running away immediately, and they fell victim to the tsunami," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the Indonesia disaster agency BNPB, at a meeting in Jakarta.
"Tsunamin wasn't alone but dragged cars, stocks and houses with it. It hit everything on its way," Nugroho said. He also said that Tsunamin had traveled on the open sea for up to 800 km/h before the affected coastline.
Some climbed up trees to get away from the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
Flight photos released by the disaster agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are distorted and have collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
Aftershock still hit the coastal town on Saturday.
The number of earthquakes was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology BPPT stated in a statement that the amount of energy released in the huge earthquake on Friday was 200 times as large as the atomic bomb released at Hiroshima in World War II.
The city is at the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have made tsunamin larger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the destruction as "comprehensive" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
Dead victims were found in the vicinity of collapsed buildings, he said, and 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and damage can be even worse along the coast line 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donganga, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication from Donganga "was completely obsolete without any information," Nugroho said.
"It lives over 300,000 people there," said the Red Cross in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse," they said.
The Agency was criticised on Saturday for not informing that Tsunamine had hit Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had appeared within the time of the warning.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the floor in a building screams frenetic warnings about tsunamine to people on the street below.
In a few minutes a wall of water will collapse towards the beach and sweep away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a massive power break that disrupted all communications around Palu, making the rescue work more difficult for the authorities.
The military has begun sending cargo flights from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated people are still in great need of food and other necessities.
The airport has been opened for aid work and remains closed for other traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in tsunamis in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Workers from the World Vision in Dongala have gone to Palu where they are seeking protection during the broadcasts on the farm outside the office, but they saw destruction along the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
"They said they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Aid groups have started the obvious aid work, but some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, needs and employees from abroad may be used only if an exemption permit is declared after a disaster.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the authorities say it is a national disaster, we can release international aid, but that status has not yet been revoked."
When the second night fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, relatives and friends of missing persons were still hoping that their loved ones would prove to be the miracles that shed light on dark natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a kloak.
In Sunday's saved rescue workers, a woman who was stuck in labor for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, Indonesia’s national type-flight trainer, had trained two of the missing screenflights in front of Asian games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others who were stuck at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a pilot, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told me that hours after the screenshots heard that Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he was desperate to send whatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages only got a gray book, instead of two blues.
"I think it means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves take $26,750 under ATM at Newport on the Livee
On Friday morning he stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who filled out a ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The driver of the car had emptied a ATM in the entertainment facility and would deliver more money, criminal Dennis McCarthy said in the message.
While he was busy "shopping up another man behind Brink's employee" and stealing a bag of money to be delivered.
The witness saw several suspected planes from the scene, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many involved in the incident.
All those who have information on the identity of the perpetrators shall contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper renames to Ye
Rapper Kanye West renames – to Ye.
He announced the name exchange on Twitter on Saturday and said, "The warning that is formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for a longer time and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The name change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande in the program, who introduced "sensitivity reasons" according to the programme's creator.
Ye is an abbreviation of West's current professional name, but he has also said that the word has a religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year when he talked about the title of his album with the radio values Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am we, we are.
It went from Kanye, which means 'the only', to only Ye – a reflection of our good, our evil, our confused, everything.
The album is like a mirror of who we are."
He's one of a number of well-known rappers who's changed his name.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously collaborated with the West, has previously written his name with and without strings and versals.
Mexico's AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's recently elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use the military against civilians now that the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody revenge against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza this Saturday that "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Troops fired weapons against a peaceful demonstration at the square on October 2, 1968 and killed up to 600 people during a century when left-wing student movements took root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans with monthly contributions to students and by opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of education attract young people to criminal gangs.
USA should double AI funding
Now that China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount spent on research in the field, according to the inventor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment will come after several parts of the US government have made statements about AI, although the US does not have a comprehensive formal AI strategy.
China presented its plan last year with the goal of becoming the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States and we are looking for the next breakthrough within AI," Lee said.
A double budget can double the chance that the next major AI breakthrough will be made in the United States, Lee told the CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was previously published in the month of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading AI companies – Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s he worked on an AI system that hit the top-ranking American Othello player, and later he was led by Microsoft Research and was CEO of Google's China Department.
Lee mentioned previous technology competitions from the U.S. government, such as Robot Challenge from Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what would happen next to identify future visionaries.
In the United States researchers often have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders from us, but the companies," Lee said.
In recent years Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired leading personalities from universities to work on AI.
Lee said that new immigration policies can also help the US with the AI innovation.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctors within AI," he said.
State Council in China issued its development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative they call AI Next.
NSF is currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
American legislation that would create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not made any progress in several months.
Macedonian referendum on the change of name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to "the Republic of North Macedonia", which would solve a decade-old dispute with Greece that has prevented the country from joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that its name in the north is a requirement in its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the name change would undermine the identity of the Macedonian slave majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has led to doubt if the minimum participation of 50 per cent required for the referendum to be considered to be valid will be achieved.
The question of the ballot in the referendum is: "Are you for membership in NATO and the EU with the approval of the agreement with Greece?"
But the supporters of the name exchange, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is worth changing names if it does so that Macedonia, one of the countries formed when Yugoslavia was split, can join the EU and NATO.
"I am here to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, for that means safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
The people's vote is not binding, but enough Members of this House have said that they intend to follow the outcome in order to see it as decisive.
The change of name requires a majority of two thirds of Parliament.
According to the State Electoral Commission, no irregularities had been reported at 13 p.m.
However, participation was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I vote for my children, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote in the referendum in Macedonia on the country's change of name, which would pave the way for membership in NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia 30 September 2018.
Outside the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a small scene and presented chairs in front of the tents set up by those who boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go with our head in the air, not sneaking in through the back door," Kavardarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of a Euro-Asian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership would lead to adequate investments in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I think the absolute majority will vote yes, for over 80% of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said when he voted.
He said that a "yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Police Investigation Institute, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters voted in the referendum, which falls below the minimum required participation.
According to another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent of the participants thought they were voting on Sunday.
70% of them were going to vote yes.
In order to count the referendum, 50% of registered voters must be added to one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will become the first serious backdrop for the policy of the Western government since it took over last May.
Look at: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero takes over the entire Brighton defense to make a target
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton's proposal in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero got it to look ridiculously simple when he made goals in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got a pass from the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between Brighton's three defenders and went out on the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He went around a defender and ran from several others at the edge of Brighton's target area.
Then he had a fit for Sterling to the left.
The English front used its first kick in the target area to return the ball to Aguero, who used the right foot to hit Brighton's target guard Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," said City Manager Pep Guardiola to the journalists.
"We talked about him playing for 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he was making goals at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial takeover in the Premier League fight.
The target came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep into Brighton's River on that game.
He sent out a nice kick along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of triggers and led Sterling to the outside pillar.
Sky Blues forward fired the ball into the net the moment before it got out of range.
City meets Hoffenheim in the team game in the Champions League at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies
Nationals have been eliminated from the final game, so there was no reason to force one to start.
But competing Scherzer wants to throw on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only about Rockies, who is a match before Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, still has a chance to finish the game.
Rockies got a wild card place with a 5-2 win over Nationals on Friday night, but is still out after his first division title.
"We play nothing, but we can get a chance to chew rubber in knowledge of the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and that the second team would play at a higher level than any other team I'd meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be there?"
Nationals have not announced their launch on Sunday yet, but according to reports, they are reluctant to let Scherzer throw under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, warmed up in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on his normal Sunday of rest.
Washington's right-hand thrower is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 in this season.
Trump is speaking in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, when he spoke about the importance of the fact that Republicans vote in the forthcoming mid-term elections.
"All we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important choices in our life.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not running, but I'm running. That's why I'm going around and fighting for sovereign candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see a terrible, terrible group of radical democrats, you see it happening here and now.
They are determined to take back the power whatever it takes, you see their wickedness, terror.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to drive to take over power and control. That's what they want, power and control.
Democrats, he said, are fighting to "stand up and prevent".
"You've seen it in the last four days," he said, "and called the democrats angry and ugly and terrible and false."
He mentioned the Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, who sits in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was met by a high-ranking audience.
"Do you remember what she said?
'Did you leak the document?'
'Eh, uh, okay?
No, no, no, I'm waiting for a...' It was really bad body language, some of the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
They don't tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
Anyway, I'm the last one in a series of MPs from Labour who can hear that we're not welcome, just to say what we think.
My colleague in this House, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way when she was facing anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not keeping with Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of a responsible economic policy, about the security of the nation, about Europe – ironically similar subjects that Jeremy criticised earlier leaders for.
In the communication on the meeting with Nottingham East Labour on Friday, it said that "we want the meetings to be welcome and productive".
During most of my eight years as Labour's local MP, the GC meetings on Fridays have been exactly that.
Unfortunately, however, many meetings are not now, and the promise of "friendlyr, more cautious" policy has been forgotten long ago, if it ever started.
It has become increasingly evident that divergent views are not tolerated within Labour, and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether the party leader accepts it.
This began immediately after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues that I previously thought had a similar political view that I expected to make a full return and take positions that I would never otherwise have taken – whether it was the security of the nation or the EU's internal market.
Every time I speak publicly – and it really doesn’t matter what I say – I follow a tidbit of ignorance on social media that requires me to be dismissed, criticises the media and says that I shouldn’t even be in Labour.
And this doesn't just affect me.
The fact is that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of these colleagues when they face a stream of sexist and racist insults every day but never give up.
One of the biggest disappointments with this policy of yours is the level of offenses now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that Labour would promote a culture of tolerance.
But in reality, we are no longer this broad church, and with every mistrustful and change in the rules of choice, the party is becoming increasingly narrower.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years about flying under the radar and not being too far away, so it's okay.
But that's not why I became a politician.
Even since I joined Labour as a school student 32 years ago, provoked by thatcher's failure of the government to literally get my primary school classroom to fall apart, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – both at the local level and as a minister of government.
I have never hidden my political views, and that includes the last choice.
No one in Nottingham East can have been in any way confused by my views on policies and subjects where I do not agree with the current leadership.
To you who promoted the profession on Friday, I just want to say that when the country goes towards a Brexit that will damage households, activities and public services, I do not understand why anyone would want to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour's party leaders.
But my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituency – both Labour members and others: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threat to spare me or political convenience will prevent me from doing what I think is best for all of you.

Air 38-17 Melrose: Oslagna Air on top
Two attempts in the last minute may have distorted the result a bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderful entertaining Tenent's Premiership match.
They're on top now, the only unbeatable side of the ten.
In the end, it was their superior defense, as well as their ability to take chances, which gave the home team the benefit, and coach Peter Murchie has every right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested under our matches so far and are still unbeatable, so we are so clearly happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayr deserves it, they took better chances than us."
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, which was converted by Frazier Climo, gave Air leadership but a yellow card to Captain Rory Hughes of Scotland, who was released by Warriors for the match, Melrose let the figures speak and Jason Baggot made an unconverted attempt.
At the end of the first half, Climo expanded Ayr's leadership with a penalty, and at the end of the first half, he scored and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a 17-5 line in the break.
But Melrose got a good start on the other half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was converted by Baggot, reduced leadership to five points.
It was then a long wait for a serious damage to Ruarid Knott, which was carried out by the plan, and after restart Ayr increased leadership again with an attempt by Stafford McDowall, which was converted by Climo.
Air's acting captain Blair MacPherson then got a yellow card, and Melrose again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of severe pressure.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to have hit Climo without the ball, McPherson made a touch down from the fine-line out behind Ayrs' mold.
Climo converted, which he did again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent away the flange Gregor Henry for the fifth attempt of the home team.
Still Game star seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
The Ford Kiernan game star seems ready to join the restaurant industry after it was discovered that he has been designated as the CEO of a licensed restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in BBC's popular series, which he writes and plays together with his long-term comedy partner Greg Hemfill.
Duon has announced that the next ninth season will be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to be planning for life after Craiglang.
According to official register, he is the CEO of Arifingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but a source of Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan wanted to join Glasgow's "flowering restaurant industry".
"The Sea belongs to us": Free Bolivia hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific again
Seamen patrol a rich, covered neighborhood for the fleet in La Paz.
Public buildings have a sea blue flag.
The fleet's bases from the Titicaca Sea to the Amazon bear the motto: "The sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to recover it."
In coastal Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict of the 1800s is still strong – and it is also the desire to sail again on the Pacific Sea.
This hope is higher than in several decades now when Bolivia expects a decision by the International Court of Justice on the first October, after five years of consideration.
"Bolivia has the operation, a mood of unity and peace, and so clearly expects the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Court will judge for the benefit of Bolivia's demands that, after years of irregular discussions, Chile have to negotiate with Bolivia to allow them to go to sea.
The decision of Monday is also of great importance to Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic native president who faces a controversial fight for next year's reelection.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is incredible that the Court will judge Bolivia's benefit, and that it will not change much even if it does.
The United Nations Court of Justice, based in the Netherlands, has no right to allocate Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision is announced only six months after the final arguments indicates that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years may have hurt rather than promoted Bolivia's chances.
"The question of access to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
She claims that Morale's aggressive rhetoric has tarnished Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will gradually continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Before this President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, did not consider that the Court's decision had been taken very quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will give "a unique opportunity to start a new era for the relationship with Chile" and a chance to "stop for 139 years of differences of opinion with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America's most popular presidents – used the question of the sea as a political cry.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to access the Pacific," he said.
"The decision is a chance to realize that we must move on from the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament requires confidence in the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says the nation won't drop its nuclear weapons unless they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the two rival leaders.
His comments came when US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems to be at the border to resolve the death penalty for nuclear weapons pendant more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "wanted dream" to continue sanctions and US protests against a declaration that ending the Korean war will ever be a theme for North Korea.
Washington hesitates to join the statement without Pyongyang first launching significant nuclear disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism against the fact that Pyongyang is really going to deal with a weapon arsenal that the country probably sees as its only chance to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line huge main destinations on the way to shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely block the sun, we have the right thing for you.
The designs of Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a range of clever, oversized headphones for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which blended the stylish icons of Paris fashionable.
Incredible opractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and the designs have sent away their eye-catching creatures on the catwalk.
Valentino’s main creation was an exaggerated beige hat with a featherlike board hat that completely took over the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a magic hat and even an pineapple – but they are not intended to keep their head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, in almost a time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had combined lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One creature resembled a wet cloth with snorkel and diving mask, and another looked like a melted glass pot.
And if you're going on with that huge fashion, you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that the giant hats can be on their way to shops near you.
The oversized hats come immediately after La Bomba – the straw hat with a 60 cm beam that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that lay behind the incredibly opractical hat that has taken over social media sent out another great creation on the catwalk – a straw beach bag almost as big as the model in the bathing suit that held it.
The raffia bag in the terracotta, with raffia francs and a white leather handle, excelled in the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris fashionvecka.
The famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the shops next summer – the designer has had such an impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills crucial for global citizens
The independent schools of Scotland maintain outstanding academic results and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test results, which are only strengthened by individual and collective progress in sport, art, music and other social engagements.
With up to 30,000 students in Scotland, the schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career and their role as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can design and implement adapted curriculums, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and sought-after subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it will go to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year's test results show that languages are highest on the list, with a maximum number of approved results in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received A in the final Higher Grade.
Data collected from SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72 per cent of students studying mandarin received an A in Higher Grade, and 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as crucial skills as children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language as a matter of choice is now considered as as important as knowledge of nature, technology, engineering and mathematics in independent schools and beyond.
A survey carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that employers for various reasons had difficulty in filling their vacancies, with 17 per cent attributed to a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills become increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With ever more future jobs requiring language skills, these skills become necessary in a globalised world.
Regardless of career, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have accepted a second language.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 adult British published by YouTube 2013, 75 percent replied that they could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation in it, and where French was the only language that totaled a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
That is why it is so important to invest in language teaching for our children.
To be able to speak several languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance of finding meaningful employment in the future.
In Scotland, each school will learn different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach in languages considered to be the most important for Britain by 2020, for example Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
In a global economic environment, there is no doubt that language continues to be crucial for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be regarded as "international communication capabilities".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for the young people of Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James debut for Los Angeles Lakers.
Laker's coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the first season of Sunday against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes has he played yet to be determined?
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on Laker's official website.
Laker's report Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' pre-season scheme.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is making his first campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of five planned performances next week, including events in places he has great support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Pending a confirmatory vote of its candidate to the vacant post of the Supreme Court, Trump intends to build support for the forthcoming interim elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the congress before the current elections in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trumps Wheeling, West Virginia campaign event is scheduled until 19:00, Saturday evening, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trumps West Virginia-rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably deal with this week's interview of the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who was harassed after allegations of his sexual abuse, with an expected delay in the Senate's vote for up to a week while the FBI's investigation of the case is under way.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help the Republicans get some meat on their legs before the November elections.
Thus President Trump said that these five meetings next week aim to "engage volunteers and supporters when the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the hectic campaign period," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign that did not want to be named Reuters.
Night's event, scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can attract fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract attention from Pittsburgh's media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time during the last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state where he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has been looking for opinions in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come there to try to give him an increase in the opinion polls," says Simon Haeder, a state minister at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA fights to keep the hopes of life ahead of Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the parties could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup this Saturday afternoon.
The moment's twisting pendulum is a completely invented sport concept, but something that players really believe in, and more than ever before, competitions like these.
So what time is it about now?
"They had a six-point line and now it's four, so we carry it as a little moment I guess," said Jordan Speeth when he finished for the day.
Europe has, of course, four points ahead of it with 12 more to win.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have some wind in the century, but they have a lot to encourage by, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and fought at home three points of four each.
Spieth has been watered from tea to green and preceded by good examples.
The Vintrope scored higher when his round continued and he lowered a decisive pitch to take the match four all-square when he and Thomas had played after with two after two games.
His suit that won them the match of 15 meets with a similar screw, with the conviction that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"You really have to dig deep and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
It's all that all these players have left now.
18 holes to win.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cups' unmistakable story.
Europe's strange but challenging couples are four out of four and now nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
These performances and public reactions determine that they are players to hit on Sunday and there are no more popular players who could bring home a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Mostly both, at the same time at different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victories.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made the process card with Sergio Garcia, the morning's football hero, along with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine lowered the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole they never even came near to claim.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who will help you out of the hole.
Fireball and foursomes are so fascinating to look closely because of the interaction between the couple, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how a strategy can be changed at a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead before the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has a struggle that some, especially on the US side, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 in Ryder Cup last day
Europe will have a strong advantage on Ryder Cups the last day after coming out of Saturday's football and foursomes match with a 10-6 lead across the United States.
The inspired duon Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over a occupied Tiger Woods and came home all four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European Law, which fought to maintain the pod that they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American law that never really started during the morning's 3-1 football.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursome and won two matches, but it was not enough to win.
Jim Furyk's law requires eight points from Sunday's 12 single games to keep the pod.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in line while he and Molinari, baptized to "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, is just the second pair to win four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup's history.
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed into a fireball, they beat a exhausted Woods and American smoke Bryson Dechambeau with an even more oppressive 5 & 4.
Woods, who went through two matches on Saturday, showed a single-hour test of brilliantness, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in football and foursome, and seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, rested during the morning's football and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 & 1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe did not get along all the way, but it was a nice, blue day just south-west of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas put the American flag with two points on Saturday.
They came home with 2 & 1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in football and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursome after losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history has a team come back from a base on four points in the single matches, yet Furyk's side only needs an undecided result to keep the podal.
After having been the next best for two days, it seems that a counterattack on Sunday may become difficult to get through.
North Korea says that "never" will disarm unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations last Saturday that continuing sanctions had deepened their suspicion of the United States and it was not possible for the country to surrender its nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation's annual general meeting that North Korea had in recent years taken "significant steps to show its goodwill", for example by stopping nuclear and missile testing, disassembling nuclear testing facilities and by preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding answer from the USA," he said.
"Without any confidence for the United States, there will be no confidence for our national security and in such circumstances there is no chance that we will disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a process divided into stages of the nuclear power that would lead to North Korea’s being rewarded when it took a gradual step, his statements seemed significant because it did not reject a unilateral nuclear solution just as Pyongyang had previously done.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work towards "the development of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first disband its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused to negotiate to ease severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "resolve first" and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose through coercion and even opposes the "declaration of ending the war", says Ri.
"The idea that sanctions can get us on our knees is a dream for those who lack knowledge of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans at a second summit between Kim and Trump, which US leaders pointed out earlier in the UN during the week.
Instead of three meetings between Kim and the leader of South Korea, Moon Jae-in over the past five months, the minister said: "If the party in this issue of nuclear disarmament was South Korea and not the USA, the Korean peninsula's nuclear disarmament would not have come to such a state of death."
Yet the tone in Ri's speech was dramaticly different than last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's future ability to reach the US mainland with rockets was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "raketman" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take action for disarmament, but said that much work remains and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time for this and said that "if it takes two years, three years or five months", it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The maintenance of the Security Council's sanctions must continue with force and without failure until we realize a complete, final, verified decommissioning."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stifle the financing of Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri in conjunction with the UN General Assembly and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made. However, North Korea accused him a few hours later of putting "walking similar demands".
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear complex if the United States took "opposite measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the "opposite measures" he was seeking were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and were moving towards normalization of Washington relations.
Harvard students take a course to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has been given to all doctors to improve their sleep habits in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture to study through caffeine-filled "digestions".
One academic study found that students at the world’s leading university are often unconscious about the very reasons why they should take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he considers to be the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.
"At the end of that, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why can't I know this until now, in my last year?'
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, organised for the first time this year, explains to the students the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance and improve their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In part of the course there is a picture of a student room where students click on coffee cups, wardrobes, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the weight of good sleep habits.
In another part, participants may know how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of the students directly.
But we think they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," said Professor Czeisler.
The pride culture in that "dygna" still exists, he says, and allowed modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students to mean that sleeplessness was a growing problem.
To ensure that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - also to avoid weight gain because insomnia puts the student's brain in a state of hunger and keeps them hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiar studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course and has read one of his courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course was an eye-opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus course.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all doctors to complete a similar study program before starting their studies at the high-performance institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when to lay down and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic displays and LED lighting, which can cause you to turn on the day, leading to insomnia problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Men's goals are lowering Gerard's men
Rangers suffered another loss today when Dolly Mengas strike sent Steven Gerrard's uneven side to a 1-0 crash in Livingston.
The Ibrox page was after taking home its first victory on the road since February 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's law delivered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches as manager to leave his team eight points after Ladbroke's Premiership leader Harts.
Lots of beats to seven minutes before half time, and Rangers never evened out the result.
While Rangers now falls to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is only behind the Hibernian on target.
And there may be more problems on the run for Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a major wound after an object was thrown from the far end.
Gerrard made eight changes to the Betfred Cup semifinal.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 who took a point from Hearts last week and he would have been happy about the way his murder games surpassed the opponents every time.
Rangers must have dominated, but Livingston did more with the ball control they had.
It should have been a goal for two minutes already into the match when Menga's first pass passed through Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the middleman missed his great chance and shot outside.
A fresh park at the depth of Keaghan Jacobs then reached the team captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow just reached the back of the pillar.
Rangers took control of the game, but it seemed to be more hope than faith in their games during the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelo certainly felt that he should have been punished when he and Steven Lawless collapsed, but Judge Steven Thomson fanned off the Colombian call.
Rangers was only able to make two goals in the first half, but this former Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly easily accepted Lassana Coulibaly's Nick and some kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Life's opening shot in the 34th minute must go against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their character deserves it.
Again, Rangers failed to handle Jacob's fixed situation.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher went to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted on the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the switch gave almost immediate effect when the outside hit the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block the attempt.
But Livingston continued to get the opponents to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett that swung up long fit after long fit.
Holt's side could have strengthened his leadership in the last stage, but McGregor managed well to prevent Jacobs before Lithgow knocked out after the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton had another late claim for punishment when he was stuck with Jacobs, but again looked away at Thomson.
Almac: Founder of Geiger Counter
And now a page from the Sunday almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today ... the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the manicure called Geiger Meter.
Geigermeßer has become a foundation for science since then and is also great in pop culture, as in the 1950's film "Bells of Coronado", with the main role of the apparently unlikely cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
MAN, "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones you can actually hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals. "Evans:
Evans: "Yes, it's popping now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune defense to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune defense to "see" cancer cells and kill them
The vaccine will recognise the immune system as part of the treatment
The method means to extract immune cells from a patient and modify them in the laboratory
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many cancer forms and then re-injected
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancer forms.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognise cancer, saw her ovarian cancer cells disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that is common to many cancer forms called HER2 and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovary, lung and fat cancer," explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and "learning" them how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West supported Trump by wearing a MAGA cap, after his SNL appearance.
It didn't work so well.
Kanye West was blown out of the studio during Saturday Night Live after a stunning performance where he praised President Donald Trump of the United States and said that he himself would run for the post 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, where he had a Make America Great Keps, he ran against the democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"So many times when I talk to a white person, they say, "How do you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Legal Committee on the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the play of West's presentation was uploaded to social media by comic stripper Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to drive with West with the post.
West had also complained to the public that he had been harassed backstage for his main accommodation.
"They mobbed me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that cap."
They raped me!
And then they say I'm low," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you also want to lower low?" and said that he would "put on my supermancape, because that means you can't say what I can do.
Test with love."
His comments attracted more bureaus at least twice from the public and employees from SNL seemed to be generated, Variety reported. One person said, "It became a death-student in the studio."
West had come in as a late replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
The West misjudged many with their appearance of the song I Love It, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING YOU TO MOBBEN."
But the host of the chat show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was simply "being himself and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") who I think embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
We're with her, let her.
Before the show told the rapper on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the creature previously known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapparcollagen, Snoop Dogg has called himself Snoop Lion and, of course, the deceased musician Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was previously known as Prince.
Men for attempted murder after cutting at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The defendant is expected to be found at Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington fights toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-wing role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actress, 31, has said negatively about the stereotype of the macho hero and says that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be hard to respect.
In a statement to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something had gone wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married her fellow actor in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also she 31, admitted that he felt "too strong" to deal with the problem.
"I personally feel quite strong, right now--where have we gone wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"How have we raised men in view of the problems we now see?"
Kit thinks that TV may partly be responsible for the increase of toxic masculinity due to its very masculinity.
He continued: "What is inserted and what is learned?
What is learned on TV and on the streets, which makes young boys feel that they have to be in a certain way to be a man?
I think it's really one of the big issues in our time - how do we change it?
It is clear that something has gone wrong with young men."
In an interview he also admitted that he would not make any Game of Thrones followers when the series comes to an end next summer and says that he is "ready with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play in a new recording of Sam Shepards True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thought the meeting with his wife Rose was the best experience from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife thanks to the series, so it gave me my future family and my future life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, as Kit's character Jon Snow falls in love with, in Emmy's winning fantasy series.
In June 2018, the couple married Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14% of the population living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, says health authorities.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported only during the second quarter of 2018.
Most new cases were transmitted via sex and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally, HIV is rapidly spread through certain parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 from year to year.
HIV transmission is an acute issue in the HBT community of China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against HBT people is said to be widespread.
Because of its conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will marry women sooner or later.
Many of these infections are due to insufficient protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff leaked the duties of the GOP senator, shells on "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, Congressman Maxine Waters condemned the claim that one of her employees had filed personal data on three republican American senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these claims were disseminated by right-wing extremist websites.
"False, lie and more reprehensible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released contained the addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information came online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a Senate panel interview on the charges of sexual assault against the nominated candidate at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came once after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters office and released information about a member of Waters staff, reported Hill.
"This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"My staff - whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false claims - were in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Water statement received quick criticism online, including from former press secretary Ari Fleischer of the White House.
"This negotiator is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This indicates that she does not have the temper to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not be angry.
They can't be faithful.
They shall not question the motives of the interrogator.
They must be calm and reasonable."
Fleischer seemed to try to compare Water's reaction to the democrat's criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of being angry during Thursday's interrogation.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who applied for Waters in the middle of the term of office, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had warned "appropriate authorities and criminal combatants of these fraudulent demands.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally held responsible for all their acts that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees."
Review by Johnny English Strikes Again - powerless spy parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for Brexit meanings in every new British film, and the same applies to this new recording of the latest Johnny English action comedin - a series of spy parodys launched in 2003 with Johnny English and got new life 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will we be satisfied with how clearly we are becoming the nation's new export products?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face has been licensed to re-examine the case for the second time - his name indicates more than anything else that he is a broad comic creature intended for the public even in non-English countries
He is, of course, the clever secret agent, who, despite his bizarre claims on smoothieglamour, has received a little bit of Clouseau, a fine Mr. Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony to the 2012 London OS.
He is also originally based on the traveler and the international mystery man that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads that create chaos wherever he goes.
There is one or two nice moments in the latest JE movie
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval suit and when the rotor blade struck his helmet for a short time.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is shown, but humor feels quite low and strangely abundant, especially because the "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Epip itself now offer comedy as an ingredient.
Humour feels as if it is adapted to children instead of adults, and for me Johnny English is not as strange recording as inventive and focused as Atkinson's vocal bravades in the role of Bean.
The constant issue now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the British super-secret web of spies, revealing the identities of all British agents out in the field, to the agent in the great dissatisfaction of the service - an extremely small role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last strand for a prime minister who is a pompous and hard-employed figure, who already suffers from a complete collapse of his political popularity: Emma Thompson does his best with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but the manual does not offer much to work with.
Her informant informs her that when each individual active spy is busy she must use someone who has retired.
And that means the native Johnny English in his own high person, now employed as a teacher in a well-being institution, but offering informal lessons in art to work undercover alongside.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former long-lived sidekick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine, a jolly-hockey-sticks role where Vicki Pepperdine is close to being thrown away.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so awfully wrong on Her Majesty's Secret Service and hits Olga Kurylenko's beautiful woman fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister will fall hard on the charismatic technologist, who claims that he can solve the British computer puzzle: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssée of parishes: dressed to servants, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant; they create chaos when they smuggle on Volta’s luxury boat; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to use a VR headset to get acquainted with the inside of Volta’s house.
There is probably a lot of work behind the last sequence, but although the film is both charming and speedy, it has an air of children's TV around it.
Pretty moderately everything like everything.
And like the other Johnny English films, I can't help but think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour refuses to prepare a plan for British workers to work a four-day week but gets paid for five days
Jeremy Corby's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that suggests that the British work a four-day week - but gets paid for five.
According to the party, business leaders want to transfer savings made by the revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would see employees enjoying a three-day weekend - but retain the same salary.
According to sources, the idea would "pass" with the party's economic agenda for the benefit of the workers.
Changing to a four-day week has been approved by Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A senior representative in Labor said to The Sunday Times: A policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"It will not happen in one day, but a four-day work week is an effort that fits the party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker and the party's overall industrial strategy."
Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, even the Party The Greens, which promised a four-day work week during its election campaign in 2017.
However, this objective is not recorded by Labour as a whole.
A spokesman for Labour said: "A four-year-old's work week is not the party's policy and it's nothing the party agrees on."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of "faceless leaders" and "sniffer" on government companies.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water companies cannot fully recover their efforts, since a Labour Government can make "deductions" because of what they believe has been wrong.
He also confirmed plans to put employees in corporate boards and create so-called Inclusive Ownership Funds, where 10 per cent of the private company’s own funds are transferred to its employees, who are then receiving annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell the TV program "60 minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their views
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the Agency's investigations could have some Republican senators change the situation.
In an interview sent on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal something that would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I said when I went into the interrogation, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, the claim came out, and I said, "Have you done it?"
He was determined, convinced, uncertain."
However, Graham's voice seems unrelenting.
"I've already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamite charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," allowed Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all of her names couldn't verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an enormously impressive set of stars that perform and an equally impressive mission; to combat world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people wandering to Central Parks Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the real goals of the event: to fight extreme poverty before 2030.
Global Citizen Festival is, according to a 2012 statement, an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international anti-poverty group that is hoped to combat poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (if you weren't ready to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert guests would perform a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteer work, email a world leader, call or otherwise meaningfully contribute to raising awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizens been at 12 years of age to reach their goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert a genuine way to convince people to act, or is it just about so-called "clickivism" - people who feel they make real difference by signing an online application or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported that more than 19 million "actions" have been registered from its supporters who have struggled for a variety of objectives.
It is said that these measures have contributed to encouraging world leaders to announce commitments and policies corresponding to more than $37 billion, which will affect lives for more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or financed.
The group estimates that the assets collected so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the UK between investors and stakeholders who are committed to "helping children develop their full potential", promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help combat malnutrition in the area after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make social injustices as undernourished as a footnote in history," said the Ambassador of the Tracey Ulllman partnership to the crowd during a live-in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, following more than 5000 measures, which require Britain to improve the cost of mothers and children, the government announced financing of the project, Power of Nutrition, which covers food programmes targeting 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the usual questions on his website, "What makes you think we can fight extreme poverty?"
Global citizens replied: "It will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, as the great civil rights and anti-aparity movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the artists who perform at this year's New York event, whose hosts are Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use its fleet in a "block" to prevent Russian energy exports, says the Minister of the Interior
The government can "if necessary" access its fleet to prevent Russian energy operators from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, has revealed by US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria - particularly where it appears at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern parts of Europe," he said.
And according to him, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The US has the ability, with our fleet, to ensure that the waterways are kept open and, if necessary, to apply blocked, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at the event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal group called "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to handling Russia and Iran, and noted that they are really the same.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace the fuel," he said, while referring to Russia as a "day country" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements will be made after the Trump administration has aimed to increase exports of its liquid natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia, the far cheaper alternative for European consumers.
To this end, officials of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump of the United States, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "appropriate" Nord Stream 2-pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin into Moscow's "fishing".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline of $11 billion, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
They claim that Washington's opposition to the project is only driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was backed by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I strongly dislike that a third party disrupts our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren will take a "ordinary thinker" if she is to set up in the 2020 presidential election," says Senator Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that she would take a "ordinary thinker" around her participation in the presidential election after the mid-year U.S. elections.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider setting up as a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our trajectory government and it includes a woman at the top," she said.
"After 6 November, I'm going to take a real thinker to run for the president's office."
Warren weighed in on President Donald Trump during the council meeting and said that "he took this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy," she said.
Warren has been freelance in his criticism of Trump and his candidate to the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh.
On a Friday tweet, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a vote on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own supporters did not believe that she would run for 2020.
Fifty-eight per cent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two per cent supported the candidacy.
The investigation showed more support for a candidacy by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent for a potential candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed with respect to a potential 2020 candidate include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Vermont's Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after taking over in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
"What my own son is going through, what he's going through now that he's back, I can relate to other families with PTSD experience and some of the trauma our soldiers are returning with," she told the audience at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his grasping "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they will come back as other people, they will return hard, they will come back and ask if there is respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, trying to prevent a report of domestic violence and armed possession, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for Wasilla Police Department.
18 countries and the District of Columbia support the question of a new asylum policy
Arton states and District of Columbia support a legal test aimed at a new US policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang-related violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district submitted a friendly-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum-seeker who challenges the police, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complaints in the Grace v. Sessions case submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the police has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent gang members," abused her, but American officials refused her asylum application on July 20th.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
The lawyers of the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries that produce a large number of asylum seekers, as nations that face major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy changed a 2014 decision of the immigration authorities which enabled illegal immigrants to seek asylum to flee from domestic violence.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"The Federal Law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of specific facts and circumstances relating to the claim, and such a provision conflicts with that principle", according to the friendly-of-the court report.
Advocates further claimed in the report that policies that deny immigrants' entry harm the American economy and argue that they are more inclined to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary labour".
In June, Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered judges in cases of asylum to no longer grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Assyll is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion" said the Sessions when the police were announced on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu when the death figure is doubled in the search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation looked darker.
"It feels very excited," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her feverish boy in an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
"The ambulance gets dead bodies all the time.
Clean water is a commodity."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their ruined homes, rotted through damaged properties and tried to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged in the 7.5 earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who were hit by a broken back and shoulder, lay outside the Palu's Army Hospital, where the patients were treated outside due to continued severe aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he said that the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We're not running away from him.
I was pushed into the ruins of the walls, I think," Haris told the Associated Press and allowed his family to be in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it got quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US ambassador accuses China of "mobbing" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four - page ad in an American daily about the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador accused China of using the American press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily paying a supplement in the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's best selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to participate in the 6th U.S. Congress, something China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in American elections marked out what American officials told Reuters where a new phase of an escalating Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a escalating trade war with high tariffs on each other's imports.
China's return tariffs early in the trade war were designed to affect exporters in countries such as Iowa, which support Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a debate article in the Sunday's Des Moines Register, "now doubles the bullying by posting propaganda ads in our own free press."
"The Chinese government uses America's dear tradition of freedom of opinion and a free press to spread propaganda by publishing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the newspaper skyscraper on the street here in Beijing you will find a limited number of divergent voices and will not see any true reflection of the different views the Chinese people may have of China's anxious economy, because the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party's hands," he wrote.
He allowed "one of China's most prominent newspapers to pay attention to the offer to publish" his article, even though he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans scare out female voters in the middle of the election through Kavanaugh-fiascot, warns analysts
Since many top republicans defend the Supreme Court’s designated Brett Kavanaugh, who is facing several charges of sexual abuse, analysts have warned that there will be a backlog, especially from women, during the forthcoming election.
Feelings about this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they stand in the election.
It is not possible to turn the clock back, says Grant Reeher, professor of state science at Syracuse Universities Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s last attempt on an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, an elder and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to Washington, DC.
On Friday morning, the protesting "November is coming!" when they demonstrated in the hall to the Senate building when the Republicans controlling the Court Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go up," said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, to the news site.
"People say it's already been high, it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among unspecified female voters in the forebears and younger voters, 18-to 29-year-olds, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Already before Ford's public testimony against sexual abuse of the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, analyst suggested that a backlash could follow if the Republicans pressed through the confirmation.
"This has become a confused pipe for GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the Committee's vote or the final vote or about Kavanaugh coming through, it's also about how Republicans have handled this and how they've treated it," said Guy Cecil, head of Priorities USA, a group that helps democratic election campaigns, for the news channel.
But the Americans in general seem to be divided about who they should believe in in the cold water of Fords and Kavanaugh's testimony, and the latter seems to be the one they most believe in.
A new YouGov opinion poll shows that 41 per cent of respondents definitively or probably believed in Ford’s testimony, while 35 per cent said that they definitively or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying under his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as they reported by at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate Court Committee during his oath last week that Kavanaugh had violently attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate to the Supreme Court exposed his sexual organs to her while attending a party during their time as students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup aimed at competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which persons can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, make-lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorization through data."
The idea with Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some programme developers to work with the project and a group of volunteer encoders.
From this week onwards, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all business models are placed on a high edge over one night.
"We don't ask for permission."
In an article on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee converted the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality in recent months.
Also during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and head of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about this new era on the web," allowed Berners-Lee.
Bernard Water: Priest rewarded with Victoria Cross during World War I celebrates
The only priest in the English church who was rewarded with a Victoria Cross during the first world war is now celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Vann received the award for his action during the attack on Bellengise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a gunshot four days later and never learned that he had been awarded the most prestigious prize of the British military.
A monument was discovered by his two children during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his children, Michael Vann, said it was "bright symbolic", that the stone would be exposed exactly 100 years after his grandfather was rewarded with the prize.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt Col Vann led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and masking weapons."
He later ran up to the shooting line and led with the "big tapered" line forward before he alone decided the fight.
Lt Col Water was killed by a German gunfire on October 4, 1918, a little over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never live up to, but something I am very humble before."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid down a crown after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "was very honored to play a part in the parade" and allowed "a true hero to be demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night looking at Bellator 206 and instead got to see Greta Gris
Imagine this, you've been up all night to see Bellator 206 just to be refused to watch the main event.
The show from San Jose contained 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown live in the UK on channel 5.
At 06:00, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, the British viewers were surprised when the program suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were weakly impressed after keeping up with the early morning hours to watch the game.
A fan on Twitter described the program change to a signed childhood program as "a sick joke".
"It was the government's decision that the content was not appropriate in the morning, so they had to switch to children's programmes," said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of Bellator for marketing and communication when he asked about the broadcast.
"Gray grey, yes."
Bellator's CEO Scott Coker said that they will work with their schedule to better include British viewers in the future.
"I think we'll be able to find a solution with regard to the repetition," said Coker.
"But it's sex in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, the program exchange has upset a lot.
We tried to do it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it was actually a government issue.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We will show five matches instead of sex - as we normally do. We took water over our head in our quest to satisfy the fan.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "undersea" due to sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he felt inferior to his friends during his upbringing because of his sexuality - but it also moved him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize he wasn't like everyone else until he went to high school."
When he spoke in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about homosexual rights to give others "hope".
He also said that he cared less about winning OS after becoming a parent.
The popular show's regular program leader, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
During his one-time performance on Lavernes's first program, Daley tells how he felt "less host" than others during his growing up, because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
He said, "This feeling of feeling less worth and feeling different has been a real source of strength and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," he said, so he didn't let everyone down when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The dual Olympic bronze medalist has become a highly profiled advocate for HBT rights and has taken advantage of his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to convince more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he took the floor because he felt he had the chance to live openly without limitations and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that his love in a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "came as a surprise".
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscarswinner last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much in such a young age" - he participated in his first OS as a 14-year-old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age with similar life experience.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "whole life perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was just about winning gold," he said.
"But you know, there are more things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that Dad did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked about whether they had received their tickets to the 2012 London Olympics - where he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't tell him: you won't be able to sit on the front row of Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally recognized that he wasn't invincible," he said.
The year after that, Daley competed at OS 2012 and won bronze.
"I just knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of a home audience on an Olympic arena, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song – Proud of Heather Small – a song that had followed him to the OS and that still gave him shocks.
Desert Island Discs will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of the shape of the bench during Saturday Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but then he has to set the form to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in a row, was founded by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the centre of the events, which he has often been for the United States, the five-time winner spent his day acting hejaclock and practicing on his game in hopes of having a chance to demonstrate his ability.
He has never been the fastest of drivers, not even at the top of his career, and the 48-year-old is not in the shape of the tough track on Le Golf National, where the long crack often misses punishment hard.
It's not just the track that scares, in the ninth match on Sunday, Mickelson meets Master Francesco Molinari, who, along with the novice Tommy Fleetwood, won all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are 4 points below in front of the 12 single games have won at the start, Mickelson's game can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence for his player, not because he could say much else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a kick on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"His self-confidence is not wrong.
He is a celebrity and has added so much to these laws during previous seasons and last week.
I probably didn't think he'd be able to play two games.
I thought he was gonna do more, but now it's what it is, and we're gonna have fun with it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson Nick Faldo's record passes for most Ryder Cup matches played.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never completely lived up to the heights of his individual performance.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half, but Furyk said his presence brought other qualities to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, dick, he likes to have fun with people and he's a good guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I also think the younger players thought it was fun to play against him this week, which was fun to see.
He adds so much more than just games."
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership soon can be a memory only
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead in the last day's singles in Ryder Cup can quickly change into an unpleasant experience.
Dane made his debut in 1997 at Valderrama, where a team under Seven Ballester's leadership held a five-point advantage over the Americans but finally won with the smallest possible margin with the result 141⁄2-131.2.
"It reminds you that we led a great deal on Valderrama, we led a great deal on Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won with urgency and effort," said Bjorn (on the photo) after having seen the 2018 class win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday and lead with 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So history will prove to me and everyone in the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow we'll give everything.
Go out and do everything right.
This is not over until we see the point on the table.
Our goal is to try to win this pod and that is where our focus lies.
I have said it all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are well aware of what lies ahead on the other side - the best players in the world."
Bear was satisfied with the performances of his players on a tough golf course and allowed: "I would never manage this myself.
Tomorrow, new challenges await us.
Tomorrow it is the individual performances that apply and it is a very different thing.
It's fun to be out with a partner when it's good, but when you're out there on your own, your ability as golfer is fully tested.
It is the message you need to convey to the players, to get the best of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he must also go and get the best out of himself."
Unlike Björn, the opponent Jim Furyk will want the players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who came home three points of four.
Furik himself has been on both sides of big turns during the last days in a competition, both in the winning team in Brooklyn before he ended as a loser when Europe drove "Miracle at Medina".
"I remember every fucking word of it," he said in reply when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, had gathered his players before the last day.
"We have 12 major matches tomorrow, but you'd like to go out as fast as on Brooklyn, as on Medina.
When the pace starts in one direction, there will be a lot of pressure on these intermediate games.
We made our setup and placed the guys we wanted to, you know, create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the fight and meets Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter meet the other Europeans in the upper half of the scheme.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it's enough all the way," said Bjorn about his single choices.
Germany's new warships are being relaunched
The German fleet's latest fleet would have been seafaring in 2014 to replace warships from the cold war time, but it will not be seafaring until at least next year due to incorrect systems and high costs, reported local media.
The deployment of "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leader of the entirely new Baden-Wuerttemberg Fregates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which cites a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the fleet already in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery were doomed to the ambitious project.
The four boats in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the fleet ordered in 2007 will replace the old Bremen frigates.
They will contain a powerful cannon, a series of air defence and marine missiles, as well as some techniques of smuggling, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to station the latest frigates for up to two years without contact with home ports.
But continuous delays mean that the warships - which allow Germany to design power abroad - are already obsolete when they are in operation, Die Zeit writes.
The fateful F125 frigate created headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to operate the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss Bay in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
A little was known about the causes of the return, but German media indicated a number of important "software and hardware malfunctions" that made the warship worthless if it was used on a combat mission.
The lack of software was particularly important because ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be driven by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older frigates in the Bremen class.
It has also been shown that the ship has a significant overhaul, which leads to deterioration of performance and limits the marine’s ability to carry out future upgrades.
The 7 000 tonnes of heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as similar vessels used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from faulty hardware, the whole project's price gap - including the training of the crew - becomes a problem.
It is said to have amounted to EUR 3.1 billion (US$ 3.6 billion) - compared to EUR 2.2 billion in the initial phase.
Problems affecting the newest frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of the latest warnings that Germany's maritime power is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the fleet "is actually beginning to lack fully equipped vessels".
The official said it was a growing problem, as old ships were being solved but no replacement ships were provided.
He regretted that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust steals ears to the secret life of the bat
New research carried out on a property in the highlands of Scotland aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their hunting for food.
We hope that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and contribute to the management of future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the South and the Dwarf Pistrill as well as the brown long-haired and Daubenton flat mouss at the Inverewe Gardens in West Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in important places around the property to track smooth mouse activities throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert noise analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of flashing sounds and what species do what.
A life map and report will then be produced to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS' natural care advisor, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the environment are most important to the molluscs and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of life-management work such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest areas for molluscs and other related species.
Flemish mus population in Scotland and the United Kingdom have decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by building and development work that affects the wells and losses of living environments.
Wind turbines and lighting can also constitute a risk, as can aircraft and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks from house taxes.
Fladdermöss isn't really blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-localization technique to find insects and obstacles in their flight.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes flat moustache seriously.
The organisation has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out investigations, check the bonds and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated battalion reserve at Thrave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten battalion museums.
Owner David Thompson says the property is the ideal area for them.
"Here at Thrave we have a good area for flat moustache," he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of vets and a lot of favorable living environments.
But there is a lot about flat moustache that is still unknown, so the work we do here and on other property helps us to understand more about what they need to enjoy.
He stresses the importance of looking for flat-mowers before performing maintenance in properties, as it is possible that accidental destruction of a single dwelling could kill up to 400 honors and young people, and possibly expel a whole population.
Flädermöss is peaceful and it is illegal to kill, trouble or disturb them or destroy their bond.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and too many of our species we don't know how their populations feel."
Ronaldo rejects rape proceedings while his lawyers threaten to vote in the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the charges of rape against him for "false news" and says that people "want to market" by using his name.
His lawyers will vote in favour of the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus forward have been accused of having raped an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas 2009.
He claims to have paid her $375.000 to keep quiet about the event, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live video on Instagram, Ronaldo (33) beat himself from the reports as "false news" when he spoke to his 142 million followers, only hours after the requirements were reported.
"Not the least.
What they said today was false news," said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They want to market themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything good," said the player and log.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to settle Der Spiegel's claims, which they have called "an unauthorised reporting of suspicions of integrity", according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral damage to an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged event is said to have taken place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he reportedly raped her anal, according to documents submitted by Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 per cent" a "good guy" the "last percentage" fraud.
According to the document, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but that they agreed.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photos of her injuries to a hospital, but later agreed on a reconciliation because she felt "fear of revenge" and was concerned about being "degraded publicly".
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to cancel the reconciliation because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and in summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: Britain "comes forever regret" to lose car manufacturers
Great Britain "should regret it forever" if you lost your status as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Minister of Business Greg Clark said.
He allowed the fact that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, they would temporarily cease production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer announced that the effects of delays at the border in the event of no agreement being concluded could result in lost jobs.
The Burnaston factory - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see a production stop in our factory," says Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have communicated their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mini-install in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problems with regard to what car manufacturers say are risks to the supply chain in the event of a Brexit without settlement.
Toyota's production line is operated on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it may lead to disturbances at the border as the industry says may lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day’s consumption in stock at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and hence production would be forced to stop.
Clark said theresa May's Chequers' plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly calibrated to avoid border controls".
"We need a settlement. We want the best agreement that enables, as I say, not only success at present to be appreciated, but for us to take this opportunity." he told BBC Radio 4:'s program Today.
"The challenges of not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we absolutely must be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supplier chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term warned to increase costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and thus cost work.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the leader of the United Trade Union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "My experience is that these jobs never come back.
One government official said: "We have presented an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be "shooted for another week" while the fight against the Supreme Court appointed Brett Kavanaugh continues, White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is monitoring the work with Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian involvement in the election, relations between Trump and Russia and the President's potential impediment to justice.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Minister of Justice, thereby endangering Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington Square for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying hearing equipment to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of assigning the president to the 25th addendum of the American Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, and reported that he was going to quit.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then in the United Nations headquarters in New York, to be held on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate's legal committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual immorality, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke in Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "A date for it has not been established, this week, or a week-on-week review of all the other matters that occur at the Supreme Court.
But we will see, and I always like to keep the press up-to-date."
Some reporters would contest the claim: Sanders has not had a press conference from the White House since 10 September.
The value of Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences did not depend on any objectionable TV reporters who "played for the gallery", even though she said, "I agree with the fact that they play for the gallery."
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President holds several questions than any president before him," she said, and allowed without quoting the evidence: "We have looked at these figures."
Conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this often and you have seen us do a lot in recent weeks and it will replace press conferences, and then you can ask questions directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre performances in front of the gathered reporters.
Minister of Health writes to EU employees at NHS Scotland taking into account Brexit's concerns
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express their gratitude and wish to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the cost of completed status applications for EU citizens working in the country's decentralised public sector.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on exit continue to take place, in the face of decisions expected to come in autumn.
However, the British Government has also intensified its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know that this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I value every employee's work, regardless of nationality.
Fellows from all over the EU, and the rest of the world, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care work and benefit the patients and societies we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after being hit by head injury
Tennessee State Tiger's lineback Christian Abercrombie underwent an acute operation after having been hit by a major damage to Saturday's loss by 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Tennessee's Mike Organ.
Tennessee State chief coach Rod Reed told reporters that the damage occurred just before half an hour ago.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed," said Reed.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie acid on the side line before being placed on a bar were carried out for further evaluation.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center Hospital.
Harris allowed that "there is no data on the type/intensification of the damage yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a red shirt second year student, is in her first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five tickets on Saturday before leaving the game, which gave him a total of 18 tickets.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers may pay higher stamp tax when they purchase property in the United Kingdom, and the extra money is used to help homeless people, according to the new plans of the Tory party
The action will neutralise Corby's success by attracting young voters
The increase in stamp tax will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The UK Department of Finance estimates to get up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be paid a higher stamp tax when they buy property in the United Kingdom. The extra money will be used to help homeless people, which will be announced today by Prime Minister Theresa May.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corby's success by attracting young voters with promises of housing at more affordable prices and targeting high-income people.
The increase in stamp tax will be taken out by individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The additional fee is payable in addition to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago in holiday homes and dwellings purchased for rent out. It may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance believes that the measure will amount to £120 million per year.
Estimates of 13 per cent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by people living outside the UK. This drives prices up and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foothold on the housing market.
Many well-off areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost cities because of the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
The new game will only come a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in the stamp tax to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices up by buying up land without using it, and called on Theresa May to give up allowances on housing with affordable prices to solve the "poor housing situation" of the United Kingdom.
Jeremy Corbyn has launched a promising enough proposal for housing reforms, including rental roofs and an end to rentals without the responsibility of the tenant.
He also wants to give the municipalities greater opportunity to build new dwellings.
Theresa May says: "Last year I said that I would devote my time as prime minister to restoring the British dream, that life would be better for every new generation.
This means solving the problems on the housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot stand when it is as easy for people who do not live in Britain, and also for companies based abroad, to buy dwellings as too hard-working citizens in our country.
The dream of owning his home has become too many people just a remote dream, and homelessness is still an unworthy fact."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to train Scotland"
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says his "final goal" is to ever become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old bulkhead looks forward to the challenge of blowing up life in the club from the northeastern England, which is currently in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in the summer after leaving St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a game in the B-country team and that's all," Ross tells BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But when I grew up, I looked very much at Scotland on the Hampden with my father, and it has always attracted me back.
But that chance can only come if I manage to lead a club."
Among Ross trainers for Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says he was not worried about leaving such established names in such a large club. He has previously thanked no for Barnsley and Ipswich Town offers.
"Just now I'm judging the success of the answer to the question, 'Can I get this club back to Premier League?'
This club belongs absolutely home to the Premier League, considering its structure and talents," he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably just see myself as successful here if I could get the club back there."
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a period as an assistant coach in Dumbarton and a 15-month journey as a member of the Hearts training team.
Then he helped Alloa come back from the descent to the third division, and lifted St Mirren from being close to the descent to become the winner of the title of the championship season then.
Ross says he is more satisfied now than ever during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a reason for the road," he remembers and aims at when he took command of Alloa.
"I really thought leadership was absolutely right for me, in a completely different way than playing.
It sounds strange, because I had good results and could live on it, and I had some great successes.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot to go through every week.
It's still stress and pressure at work for me, but training feels absolutely right.
I've always wanted to practice and now I do it. I feel better than I've ever done in my adult life."

One study shows that the perfect time to take a beer is 17:30 on a Saturday
Summer's heat bubbles have resulted in increased income for the country's struggling pubs, but the restaurant chains have got more pressure on them.
Figures showed that pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7% in July, but the revenues of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of the CGA company, which has compiled the figures, said: "Continued beautiful weather and the fact that England remained in VM longer than expected meant that we had to see a similar pattern in July compared to June, when the pubs rose by 2.8%.
The decrease in the turnover of restaurants by 1.8% in June was only worse in July.
Pubars and bars offering mainly drinks showed the absolute best result with figures for the same period last year that had gone up more than the restaurants had gone down.
Pubar offering food was also difficult in the beautiful weather, even though it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
People just seem to have wanted to go out and drink something.
The output of managed pubs and bars went up by 6,6 % that month, and the sale of food by 3 %."
Paul Newman of the service and pleasure analyst RSM says: "These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and major sporting events are still the most important factors in wholesale sales.
It is no surprise that restaurants still have difficulties, even though a 4.8% reduction in sales each year is particularly difficult to deal with in addition to the current cost pressure.
The long warm summer could not have come any more uncomfortable for food-sales companies. Time can show whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August give any needed respect."
The total sales increase in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened facilities, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the fact that fewer new brands are now being launched.
Business Sales Supervisor Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub and restaurant industry in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes information on how 47 active groups with a total turnover of over 9 billion pounds, and is an established benchmark in the industry.
One of five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide for their parents
One study shows that one of the five children, sometimes as young as 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that they hide for their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 students in high school and high school shows an increase in the number of fake Instagram pages
The result has increased concern that there is sexual content raised there
20% of students reported having a "head account" they showed to their parents
One of five children, some as young as 11 years of age, creates accounts on social media that they keep secret for adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in high school and high school showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Instagram", a reference to the Instagram image sharing service.
The result has caused concern because it is sexual content posted there.
20% of students said they had a clean "head account" that they could show to their parents, and they also have private accounts.
A mother who joked over her 13-year-old daughter's secret page found a teenager who urged others to "violently rape me."
According to the study, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of children aged 11-18 had two profiles, and half of them recognized that they had private accounts.
HMC President Mike Buchanan says: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are attracted to creating places on the Internet where parents and teachers do not find them."
Eilid Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" in the board of the Scottish Free Sport Federation, Scottish Athletics
Eilid Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as an external board member at the annual meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most prized free sport player, and President Ian Beattie describes the choice as an excellent opportunity for those who are leading the sport to benefit from its wide international experience in the last decade.
"Eilidh has gained great respect throughout the Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are sure that athletes in Scotland will benefit greatly from becoming a member of the board," says Beattie.
Doyle says, "I want to be a voice for athletes and I hope that I can help and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at the OS in Atlanta 1996, has a total of four Olympic gold and is now an expert commentator on BBC. He lost his ability to go after a mini-stroke.
He writes on Twitter: "Today a month ago I got a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that time had to be shown if I would recover, and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I've recovered completely, learned to go again, and now I'm doing mobility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouragement!"
Advertising for breast pumps that compare moms to those who share the Internet
A company that sells breast pumps has caused disagreements on the Internet with an ad that compares breast-feeding mothers to cows that are milked.
In order to pay attention to the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent portable breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie released a music video inspired advertising film with a humorous estimation to show on which freedom the new pump gives to mothers pumping breast milk.
Four real moms dance in a high-end load with a choir to a song with text lines like: "Yes, I milk myself, but have no swings" and "If you didn't know it, this is not a joke, but a joke."
The refraction continues: "Pump out, pump out, I feed the babies, pump out, pump out, I milk the ladies."
But the advertising film, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has caused a conflict on the Internet.
The film has received 77 000 views and hundreds of comments, and has met mixed reactions from viewers. Many say it sheds light on the "fashor" of the dairy industry.
"A very bad decision to use cows to market this product.
Just as we have to get pregnant and feed them in order to produce milk, their children are only taken from them a few days after birth," writes one person.

Another comments: "It is understood that it is traumatic for both mother and child.
But of course, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their children?"
Another added: "What reality-based advertising film."
Others defend the film, and a woman admits that she thinks the song is " hysterical fun."
"I think this is brilliant.
I'd have gotten one if I was still breast-feeding.
That pump made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product," says someone.
Another comments: "This is a funny advertising film that turns to moms who pump (usually at work or in the toilet) and feels like 'cossors'."
This is not a film that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the film, women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump stuck in the habit.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women pumping milk say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no cables or pipes and can be carried discreetly in a nursing home, which gives women freedom to move, keep their babies and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin is a partner and ECD on Mother, and she says: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women who pump breast milk and milk, we wanted to shed light on breast pumping and the challenges with it, while showing in a entertaining and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump gives.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump creates headlines.
During London’s fashion week, a two-child mom appeared on the catwalk with designer Marta Jakubowski’s clothes while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp near the Texas border
The number of migrant children deprived of their liberty has increased even though the number of people crossing the border each month is relatively unchanged, partly due to the fact that violent rhetoric and hard politics introduced by the government of Trump has made it more difficult to place the children in reference persons.
Earlier, most referees themselves had been paperless immigrants, and afraid to put their own opportunities to stay in the country at risk by declaring themselves willing to receive a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential referees and other adult members of the household would have to provide fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Authority, witnessed to the Congress that the Authority had arrested tens of thousands of people who had applied for a referral to single minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested were not known by law enforcement authorities since then.
"Almost 80% of those who are either referees or family members of referees are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are criminal aliens.
So we continue to pursue these individuals," Albence said.
In order to deal with children's affairs more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to be in court within one month of their recruitment, rather than after 60 days, as previously practised, according to the staff at the lectures.
Many of them are present on video link rather than personally to bring their speech for legal status before an immigrant judge.
Those who are not deemed entitled to protection shall be deported quickly.
The longer children are deprived of their freedom the more likely they are to be affected by anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or refugee attempts, according to staff at the lectures and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Proponents say that concern is increasing at larger facilities such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is more likely to be ignored because of the size of the facility.
They add that if children are moved to the tent without having enough time to prepare emotionally and to say good - bye to friends, the traumas can aggravate many of them.
Syria requires US, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country is within its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "will be handled accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem stressed that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said that the government of Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have freed all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opponents of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said that the circumstances are good for them to come home, and accused "some Western countries" of spreading "irrational fear" that enable refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They're policing something that should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help to rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a fresh agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel fortress Idlib has created an opportunity to move on with political talks.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement disrupted a major attack by Russian-supported Syrian troops against the province, which has three million inhabitants.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines", and expressed hope that a military intervention would be directed towards jihadists, including warriors from the Al Qaida-connected Nusrafronten, who "will be expelled".
The UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of members of the government and members of the opposition in order to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee and said that the Group's work would be limited to "review of the articles of the current Constitution", and warned of interference.
Why Donald Trump will win a reelection
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the re-election 2020 if his presidency did not end in the past by means of state law and scandal, which many liberal viewers are likely to hope for.
In what would no doubt be "the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever!"
At present, there are no signs that the viewers are tired.
Since 2014, the watch numbers at best transmission time have been more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and are almost three times that high, 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best transmission time, which is an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has peaked the list of cable channels with as many as 3.5 million viewers during big news evenings.
"This is like a fire that people are drawn to, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, who is driving the show for ABC's "Designated Survival" drama, which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack has destroyed Capitolium.
Nell Scovell is a multifaceted comedy writer and has written "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club".
She remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told me he'd vote on Donald Trump.
She asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh'," Nell Scovell told me.
The chaos has a maintenance value.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, Washington's report can determine the future of the legal case in the issue of abortion, Roe vs Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the well-being of the global economy.
Closing off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you have suddenly sat and watched for six hours on an expert panel discussing Bob Woodward's use of "deep background sources" to his book Fair", Paul Manafort's bomber jacket of straw leather for $15,000 ("a plague filled with hybrids", such as Washington Post sa) and the meaning in Stormy Daniel's macabra descriptions of Donald Trump, hm, anatomy.
I'm never going to look at Super Mario myself again.
"A part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality series is that he comes with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's rotating role crew and day-to-day intrigues (very cool with NFL, praised Kim Jong-un).

When I spoke to the TV producer Mr.Fleiss this week, it was the sun and 27 degrees outside his house in northern Kauai in Hawaii, but he sat and huddled inside and watched MSNBC while he recorded a broadcast from CNN.
He could not get tired, not when Brett Kavanaugh was brought before the Senate's judicial committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs in the past and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Mr. Fleiss said to me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money based on currents into the smoothest race ever before the mid-year election
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania 17th Congressional District receives a lot of money. It is thanks to the restructuring of a Congressional District that has made two members now compete for the same place.
This recently bordered suburban district in Pittsburgh is represented by the Democratic Conor Lamb, which took its place in another district at a special election last spring.
Lamb campaigns against another member, the Republican Keith Rothfus. He is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned after the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January that the old district was constitutionally changed to the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a campaign financing dispute between the economic sections of the major parties, Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee, (DCCC) and National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a short win in a wide-guarded special election in March to the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
That place had been occupied by a republic for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts had given the Democrats a certain leap.
USA considered punishing El Salvador for Chinese support but then backed up
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with Panama's president Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the participants joined the team of directors of the Trump Organisation.
Officials of the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs decided to call at home the heads of the American missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "newly decided not to recognise Taiwan", said Department spokesperson Heather Nauert in a statement earlier this month.
However, only sanctions were planned against El Salvador, which was estimated at $140 million in U.S. aid 2017. The money would go to drug control and development and constitute financial support.
The proposed sanctions, including reduced financial assistance and visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American country hard with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
While internal meetings continued, American and Central American officials launched a high-level conference focusing on security and economic well-being to follow up a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials within the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, which in practice put an end to the considerations about sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, which will take place in mid-October, which is a sign of how important the Presidential Administration considers the meeting to be, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys returned in silence to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or punishment from Washington.
A spokesperson for John Bolton from the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate, described by the three American officials, two of whom were diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal debates against the promise of anonymity.
Their accounts were confirmed by an external analyst who was close to the administration and who also spoke anonymously.
Study history
The next inevitable step may be the Special Rapporteur Robert Mueller's report on Donald Trump's alleged abuse of justice, as there is now considerable evidence in public registers.
Mueller is also reported to be controlling its investigation into whether Donald Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in its attack on the U.S. election.
If the convention were to change majority, Trump would be held responsible before that congregation just as he prepares to stand up for the election once again, and perhaps finally before a civil jury.
There are many uncertain factors in this, and I do not want to say that Trump will inevitably fall, nor will his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to meet different choices, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how the withdrawal of the fight can be.
In 1938, German officers were ready to issue a coup against Hitler, if only the western countries had stood against him and stood behind the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbath that then followed.
History revolves around such crucial events, and the impatience of democracy is speeding up or slowing down either.
Americans are now facing several of these crucial events.
What will we do if Donald Trump gives the Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what's going to happen to Mueller's investigation, the kick?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this magazine reported that he proposed last year to secretly record the president, and speculated that he would not be fit for the office.
Rosenstein says the Times reporting is wrong.
"How should we respond if the recently requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unjust, or if he is allowed to enter the Supreme Court in spite of credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the middle of the year at a congress that holds Donald Trump responsible?
If we fail in these trials, democracy faces a dark period.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi race that once occupied my ambassadorial residence.
She survived, migrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me on the way to light the Sabbath light on the table decorated with the hook.
With what as an inheritance, how could I be anything but optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans in Rangers is optimistic in front of the Rapid Vienna meeting
Rangers are receiving Rapid Vienna on Thursday. They know that winning the Austrians after the impressive Spanish game against Villareal that ended up undecided earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europe League.
A knockout prevented the midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season, until the 2-2-game against Villareal. But he thinks Rangers can use the result as a springboard against greater success.
"It was a good point for us, because Villareal is a good law," says the 31st.
"We went into the game in faith that we could get something, and went from there with a point.
Maybe we could have got it in the end, but in the larger part, it was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, we came back in the second half, and it was the best team.
Now on Thursday it will be an important evening in Europe again.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a tough match. They got a good result at their last match, but if we have the audience with us we can probably get ahead and get a good result.
Last year was very hard, with everything that happened to my injuries and changes in the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The troops are good and the guys are fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put the last season behind us and succeed."
Women sleep poorly because of fear of pension savings
Although the participants in the survey had a clear picture of how they wanted to be honored, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of those participating in the nationwide study said that they had talked to their mates about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the step and talk about it," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
This is how you start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to care for you if you don’t talk about how you want it in good time.
Work with your advisor and your family and discuss where and how you want to care. Your choices can have a major impact on the costs.
Get help from your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your choice of long-term financing may include a traditional long-term care insurance solution, a hybrid life-insurance solution with cash value to cover the costs, or self-insurance with your own resources, if you have advice.
Create legal acts: Avoid legal disputes from the beginning.
Create a guardianship so that you can appoint a trusted person who will take care of your medical care and ensure that your healthcare staff will follow your wishes, if you become unable to communicate.
Consider also a mandate for your economy.
Then you choose a trusted person who can make financial decisions instead and make sure that your bills are paid if you are unable.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that you have an elderly parent who is in an emergency medical condition and is on her way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down such details so you're ready.
"It's not just the economy that's at stake, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicine is that?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure the plan is ready."
Ilfracombe was several times protected with air rifles
A man was shot several times with guns as he walked home from one evening.
The victim, aged 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe in Devon when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The police describe the shooting, which took place about 02:30, as a "single event".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
The damage is not life-threatening, and the police are urging the witnesses to hear from themselves.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday. It is reported by officials. The figure of death is expected to rise.
The communications are off, and rescue personnel have not yet been able to obtain any information from the management area of Dongala, an area north of Palu, which is located near the epicenter of the earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Dongala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Centrala Sulawesi, and is located in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The city's population was estimated to be 379 800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donghala is a management area extending over 300 km from the northwest coast of Sulawesis.
The administrative area, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
The support pillars in the province of Centrala Sulawesis are fisheries and agriculture, particularly in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last hundred years, according to the Indonesian disaster management authority.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
Even in 1996, West Dongala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is in the Circumcyptic Seismic Fire, which is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake at the west coast of the Indonesian Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries. 226,000 people died along the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of magnitude 6,8 on Richterskalan hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1 100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai islands outside Sumatra. A tsunami of up to ten meters was triggered. Thousands of villages were destroyed and around 300 people were killed.
2016: A major earthquake hit the management area of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that collapsed.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok. More than 500 people died, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily beached.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Alaskan governor and Vice-President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for abuse.
Palin, who is 29 years old and from Wasilla in Alaska, was arrested for domestic violence, for having filed a report on domestic violence and for having opposed the arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska National Police.
According to the police report, he should have taken the phone from a female acquaintance who tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes.
Palin is a prisoner of liberty in the Mat-Su-Hacht and is held against the $500 debt to be paid if the suspect violates the terms of the debt, according to the TV channel KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "guaranteeed not guilty" when he was asked to give up his position, according to the TV channel.
Palin is suspected of three cases of minor offences under Class A, which means he can be imprisoned for up to a year and $250,000 in fines.
He has also been charged with a case of less serious B offences, punishing him with a day in prison and $2,000 in fines.
It's not the first time Palin's been charged with a crime.
In December 2017 he was charged with violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The case is now being handled by Alaska's Veterans.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of reporting domestic violence and of holding arms under the influence of that event.
His girlfriend accuses him of hitting her in the face.
Sarah Palin received criticism from the 2016 vete groups after she had linked her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome, resulting from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed hundreds of homes.
Electricity supply and communications are down, and death figures are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck right outside the central Sulawesi, which lies north-east of the capital Jakarta of Indonesia.
Films that show when it hit are now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered to a beach festival in the city of Palu when Tsunamine hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors report a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist robbery in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are working on a death penalty for Sayfillo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York who killed eight people. It is a rare punishment that has not been committed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, should have used a rental car from the building and interior chain Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway on the lower Manhattan. He threw down pedestrians and cyclists on his way to the attack, which took place in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily damage, according to the statement of intent on the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both counts of charges may constitute a death sentence, according to the court case.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was charged by a federal jury of 22 points, including eight cases of murder to support protection activities, which are often used by federal prosecutors for organised crime, as well as abuse and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "wide-ranging planning and will," the prosecutors said, while describing the way Saipov carried it out as "disgusting, cruel and inhuman".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused family and friends to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci damage and loss", says the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
New York's southern district has not been engaged in a case of death penalty for a decade.
The alleged, Khalid Barnes, was murdered by two drug addicts, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The recent death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York in 1953. The married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced to espionage for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were both executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, who is a Uzbek citizen, showed, according to the court documents, a lack of remorse during the days and months following the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was satisfied with what he had done.
According to the trial, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack after watching ISIS films on his phone.
He also asked to have the IS flag set up in his hospital room, the police reported.
He has not declared himself guilty of the 22 counts of charges.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov. He stated that they are "of course disappointed" in the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to commit death sentences instead of going to life imprisonment without the possibility of conditional release if the defendant confesses guilty only prolongs the trauma caused by these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's team of defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to pursue the death penalty.
Mr Tories said that Mr Farague should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the army of the people" today during a protest at the Tories conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must "know the heat" of the EU skeptics, when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians suggested that he lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Member Peter Bone said at the Birmingham march that Britain had already "must have left" if Nigel Farage had been Brexit Minister.
However, the challenge facing Theresa May in getting the deep-separated adherents to reconciliation has been exacerbated by positive members of the European Union, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his compromise plan, the Chequers Agreement, alive during attacks by Brexitan-hangers, people who want to stay in the Union and the EU themselves.
Her allies have insisted that she should press and try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the backdrop, and force EU skeptics and Labour Party to choose between her package solution and "chaos".
Bone said at a mass meeting organized by the organisation Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "sola the Chequers agreement".
He indicated that Nigel Farage should have been made equal and given responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had stood at the wheel, we would have been out at this team," he said.
Peter Bone, who represents the Wellingborough District in Parliament, said: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we must break the Chequers Agreement".
He explained his resistance to the EU and said: "We have not fought world war to be subject.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the claim that the general opinion would have changed since the referendum in 2016: "The idea that the British would have changed and now want to stay is completely false."
Brexitan Hanger Andrea Jenkins from the Tory Party was also on the march and spoke to the journalists. "I just want to say, 'Minister, listen to the people.'
The Chequers agreement is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in the party and in our voters who are out in the streets and make sure that we are elected.
Put the Chequers deal away and start listening."
And she allowed a sharp message addressed to Theresa May: "Ministers may keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Nigel Farage said at the meeting that politicians must "know the heat" if they would fail the decision taken in the referendum 2016.
"Now it's about trust between us, that is, the people, and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to cheat Brexit, and we're here today to say to them, 'We're not going to let you get away with it.'
To the enthusiastic crowd he allowed: "I want you to have our political class, which is close to failing Brexit, to feel the heat.
We are mobilising the army of the people in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, independent and proud Great Britain."
At the same time, EU supporters marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour mass meeting in the city centre.
A group of activists fanned with trails with the text "Tory members against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
The Labour Parliamentarian Lord Adonis of the Overhouse lost the Conservatives for the security problems they encountered with a party app when the conference opened.
"It is these people who say they can have IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus plus the agreement, for free-of-fits borders and free-trade in Ireland," he said.
"It's a pure father.
There's no good Brexit," he said.
Warren plans a "ordinary thinker" to run for the president's post
American Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to take a "ordinary thinker to run for the president's post" after the November election.
The Boston Globe newspaper reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future during a cityhouse meeting in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren has often criticised President Donald Trump, and is now renouncing the Republican State Representative Geoff Diehl, who was the deputy president of the Donald Trump campaign in Massachusetts 2016.
She has been subject to speculation that she may be taking a Donald Trump 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th cityhouse meeting with the voters since Donald Trump joined.
One person asked her if she was planning to run for the president's office.
Warren replied that it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our tragic government.
A person arrested for shooting the basketball player Sims from LSU
The Baton Rouge police in Louisiana announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for shooting LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced that Diteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 for ET.
They had released a film of the shooting on Friday to help identify a man who was seen in the pictures.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot to death near Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and eventually died of this," said police chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday via the news site 247 sports.
Wayde went in between to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he had been on the scene and had a gun, and he admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any incidents and taken to the police station in East Baton Rouge.
Sims was a junior player, 198 cm long and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 start last season, and cut in 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of the world champion after the team murderer gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes' teams would play a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start and almost hung out Hamilton on dry when he defended his position under the first two yards, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the bottom first and let Hamilton drive into the back of the joint, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes went into the den a row later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after a little wheel-cool-wheel-action where the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside free with the risk of offering in place after a double draw to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen started in the rear row and was seven at the end of the first row on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race and held on to the deck to reach a quick goal and drive over Kimi Raikkonen and become four.
Finally he came into the bottom of the 44th yard, but failed to raise the pace during the remaining eight yards when the Raikkonen went up in fourth place.
It's a hard day, because Valteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let go of me.
The team has done an exceptional job and got one and two," Hamilton said.
Very bad body language
Mr. President Donald Trump, Senator Diane Feinstein was executed at a mass meeting on Saturday, because she maintains that she has not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated judge of the Supreme Court, is charged with sexual abuse.
The president, who spoke at a mass meeting in West Virginia, did not directly bring up the testimony from Ford before the Senate's Judicial Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "delicate, undiscovered and false."
"The only thing that could happen and the good that has happened in the last days in the Senate, when you see evil, when you see people who are angry, wicked, undiscovered and lying," he said.
"You see press releases and leaks, and then they say, 'No, I haven't.
I haven't done it.'
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, are you out of your mind?
Do you remember her answer? 'Have you leaked the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I haven't leaked it.'
Wait a minute.
'Have we leaked... no, we haven't leaked anything'', he allowed, and imitated the senator.
The letter detailing Ford's charges against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and expired in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have come from her office.
"I haven't covered Ford's charges, I haven't missed her story," Feinstein told the committee according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she wished."
But her dementia seems not to have fit the president, who, during the Saturday evening meeting, commented: "I will tell you one thing. That was really bad body language.
She may not have done that, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President continues to support the candidate to the Supreme Court, who has been charged with the sexual offence of three women, and he indicated that the Democrats used the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back the power with all the necessary means.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control," said the president, according to the Mediate Digital News website.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for Belfast Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars played Friday's loss in Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return game with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Belfast Giants received an early two-way lead through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie filed for the home team before Dwyer restored the management of Belfast Giants.
Francois Bouchard filed for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen won.
It was the third loss in the Elite League for the Adam Keefs season, which came from behind and beat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season for the two laws, and Belfast Giants had won the three previous matches.
Dwyer's opening target came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on assistant from Kendall McFaul, and David Rutherford gave assistance when Beauvilier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the intensive first period, Sullivan returned home to the match at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt delivered to Cownie who filed at 15:16.
Dwyer saw that Belfast Giants was in charge at the first break when he made his second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard scored again with a goal in power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second period, and he secured the win with his team's fifth half-way through the final period.
Belfast Giants, who has now lost four of their last five matches, will play home against Milton Keynes at his next match on Friday.
Aeroplanes died so that hundreds of people on a plane could flee from an earthquake
A pilot in Indonesia is now being hailed as a hero after he died when he saw that a plane with hundreds of people on board could lift safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are stuck in the mud in the city of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild swinging control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air's flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could lift safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was coming.
He died in a hospital later.
The speaker for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirat, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of people's lives, according to the Australian TV channel ABC News.
"We arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan on Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
We're shocked to hear this," he said.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of deaths may rise to over a thousand people. The disaster relief authority says that access to the cities of Donganga, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death rate is believed to continue to increase as there are still many bodies left in the ruins, and many have not been able to reach," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the Authority.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly in aid and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with dead bodies.
It's bad for clean water.
The retail markets are being robbed all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help survivors, but we do not know what they will encounter from there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the duties related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" according to CNN.
Indonesia suffered earlier this year from earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Flight crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that a man is missing after a plane crashed in a lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane crashing into a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific now indicates that one man is missing. Previously it was said that all 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated from the sinking plane and were safe.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it worked with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer the questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed in the water when it tried to land at the Chuuköran airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline stated that six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and how the incident looked.
The airline and the U.S. fleet both reported that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the landing course.
Some Witnesses thought that the planet was heading past the landing course.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew in very low.
"It's extremely good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to swim through deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking planet.
He said that the cabin staff panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor shell damage.
The U.S. fleet said that sailors working near developing a shipyard also helped in the rescue work by using a blowable boat to drive people in the country before the planet sank in the 30 - foot [30 m] deep water.
Data from Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in accidents with airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analysts draw up a timeline for the night when a woman burned alive
On Saturday, the gang page ended its plea in the second trial against a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive 2014.
Analyst Paul Rowlett of the U.S. Department of Justice spoke for hours as experts in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used mobile phone lists to puzzle the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber's movements that night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers that night she died, which contradicted his earlier claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chamber's cell phone during the time he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked about Tellis telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lie, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another objection was that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone lists showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis removed Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone a while after Chambers died.
"He took her out of his life," said Hale.
The defence is scheduled to begin its final speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is consciousness hippop?
A hippop-trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling his music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that the hyphen has come far from its origin in political messages and to tackle social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hiphop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently been refreshed in the United Kingdom by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
A black one again?
A child girl in New York agrees with a couple because of abandonment after a "racist" text message
A New York-based girl agreed to a discriminatory termination after she received a text message from modern, who complained that she was "a black again".
The couple deny that they would be racist and compare the mood with "expression".
Two-child mother Lynsey Plasco-Faxman expressed fear when she realized that the new baby girl Giselle Maurice was black when she came to her first working day in 2016.
"NOEEEEEEEEEEJ NOT A SMART IGEN," Lynsey Plasco-Faxman wrote in a text to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After she realized her mistake, Plasco-Faxman was "bad to fight", and Maurice fired, and claimed that their former child girl, who was an African American, had done a bad job and that instead she was expecting a Filipino woman, according to New York Post.
Maurice got paid for a day's work and was sent home by taxi.
Now she's the couple to get compensation for the dismissal, she's asking for compensation in the order of $350 per day for the job she was hired from the beginning to do, which would be six months and where she would stay with the couple, but she had no contract.
"I want to show them you don't do that," she said to New York Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple put aside the charges of being racist and said that the only reason was to end Giselle Maurice's employment, and they were concerned that they could not trust her when they had offended her.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said Joel Plasco to New York Post.
"But would you trust your children to someone you had been unconcerned with, even though it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
I'm serious.
Plasco compared the mood to "expression" and said that his wife would give birth two months later and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Would you like to join such a person?
It is not particularly pleasant," said investment banker Plasco.
The legal process is still ongoing, but the public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media and criticises them for their behaviour and reasoning.
The Paddington publishers did not think that readers could relate to a talking bear, revealing a new letter
The author of Paddington, Michael Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, commented: "It's hard to think about what it was like for a person who first read it before it was issued.
It's very funny, given what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She told her father, who had worked as a cameraman on BBC before he was inspired by a little toy bear to write the children's book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She allowed the 60th anniversary of the first edition to be "bitter love" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family", and allowed her father to be proud in the silence of his final success.
"He was quite quiet by himself, and not a strange person," she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child that succeeds. You're proud of the child even though it's not yourself who has accomplished it.
I think he saw Paddington's successes a little bit like that.
Even though it was his creation and his fantasy, he always used to give Paddington his own honor."
My daughter was going to die, and I had to say good-bye on the phone.
By the time she landed, her daughter had been taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors were working to save her life.
"When she called regularly to say that it was really bad, and that you didn't expect her to make it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad who said she would die within two minutes and that I had to say good-bye to her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medications that the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive slowly broke out and left her body.
She had died just before, and now everything was gone.
I just got to sit there and wait and know that all this happened.
I couldn't bite or scream or cry, because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to get together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was now grieving the loss of her daughter, went on board with the other passengers, who were completely unaware of the difficult test she was going through.
"No one knew about it," she said.
"I bent down my head, and the tears ran all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women set up postcards to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost relatives because of suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up a map on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that you can call to get support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he started suffering from depression, and he took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parents to need as bad as I do every day," she says.
Sharon Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, and she tells me that her son was a promising cook who had an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew who he was because of his smile.
They said his smile lit up the room."
But he stopped working before he died because he was "in a very dark place."
Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his cousin when he took his life from him in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, "I'm worried about consequences all the time."
Sharon Davis created the card "for people to know that there are people who can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't be quiet, talk about it."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been a friend of Sharon Davies for years, lost his partner 15 years ago, Mark, a while after his mother died.
"He had not said he felt depressed or depressed or anything," she says.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he was acting different.
On Christmas day he was at the bottom, and when the children opened their Christmas bells, he had no eye contact with them or anything."
She says his death was a very severe blow to them, but they have to go through it. "It breaks up a wound in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we have to fight all over again."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI launches an investigation
"I thought that if we could achieve something similar to what he asked for - an investigation that is limited in time and scope - we could perhaps have some agreement," said Jeff Flake on Saturday. He allowed him to fear that the committee would be "split" because of deep-rooted party differences.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their resistance depends entirely on the time.
The mid-year elections will take place in just five weeks, on 6 November. If the Republicans make a bad choice, which is expected, they will be heavily weakened in their efforts to get the man they want to have elected to the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary for George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to break the state of death and confirm his election to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean droplets under Kim
The number of North Koreans jumping from South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, says a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, who cites data from the Ministry of Reunion of South Korea, says that 1,127 people jumped from last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park says that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher taxes on human smugglers are important causes.
Pyongyang has not submitted any public comments.
Finally, most of the refugees from North Korea are offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flights across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China sees despair as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back with violence.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is technically still at war with each other, has improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two Pyongyang countries met for talks focusing on the ongoing negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un of Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the US sanctions for the lack of success since then.
"Without confidence for the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we cannot disarm ourselves unilaterally first," said Ri at a speech in the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh " hysterical", and says he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader of the Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh " hysterical" and said that he was temperamentally unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosis comments came in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved like this, she would be called 'hysterical'," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotionally sensitive when he denied the charges of having sacrificed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
During his opening presentation, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and then he almost screamed and the voice stopped when he spoke about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Committee's democrats, and said that the charges against him were a "grossful and coordinated murder" organised by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she felt that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, since it showed that he was partial to the detriment of the democrats.
"I think he is disqualifying himself with his statements and the way he attacked the pair Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi doubted when she was asked whether she would try to bring Kavanaugh before the state court if he was elected, and whether the Democrats had a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this – if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the court he is currently at," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Court of Appeal.
Pelosi allowed her as a democrat to be concerned about what decisions Kavanaugh could take against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion of Roe vs. Wade, as he was considered a conservative judge.
In its confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It is not possible for a hysterical and party person to sit in the courtroom and expect us all to applaud," Pelosi said.
Women have to stand out.
It is just criticism, months and years of anger that boils over, and she cannot get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual.
And she continued: "I got good help from a woman who was the CEO somewhere. She said that she also cried when she got angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started to cry, she said to the person she spoke with: 'You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry.'
And then she went on.
I thought it was bright."
Tears are allowed to lead to a partial outpouring of anger so that they are often misunderstood in principle.
One of my most clear memories from one of my first jobs in a man-dominated office, where I once wept of indescribable malice, was that I was taken into the lap of an older woman. It was a cool boss I had always been a little afraid of, and she brought me into a stairwell.
"Let them never see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're happy they managed to push you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught up with an extramarital business on a boat called Monkey Business and left the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder felt that there was no reason not to investigate the idea of setting himself up in the presidential election.
"It wasn't a well-thought decision," she said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates, the last they needed was another one.
Someone called it "Snow and the Seven Dwarves."
Since she was late, she lay behind with the cash collection and promised not to join as a candidate if she didn't get $2 million together.
It was a project that was doomed to fail.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'll get a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in a speech that she would not start a formal presidential campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings, gratitude for those who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to collect money and address voters rather than delegates, and maliciously against sexism, that the voice stopped.
"You could have thought I had a nervous breakdown," recalls Schröder near the press.
"You could have thought that Kleinex was my business sponsor.
I remember thinking, "What are they gonna write on my tombstone?"
'She's crying?'
Why the US-China trade war can be good for Beijing
The opening up of the trade war between the United States and China was deafening. The war is far from over, but the gap between countries can benefit the Chinese government in the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump launched the first warning shot earlier this year by wearing important Chinese export goods such as solar panels, steel and aluminium with customs.
The most significant stopover came this week, with new customs duties on goods for $200 billion, which in practice means that half of all goods coming into the United States of China are covered by customs.
Beijing has responded with the same coin every time, and recently it was spent on taxes of between five and ten percent of American goods for $60 billion.
China has promised to match US measures. The next largest economy in the world will probably not step down within a hurdle time.
Backing Washington means bending down for demands, but the public cracking for the United States would be very embarrassing for China's President Xi Jinping.
However, experts believe that if Beijing is playing its short right, the US trade war press can provide a positive support to China in the long term by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies on each other.
"A quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions for economic panic in the one country, and it is actually much more dangerous than the observers have previously wanted to admit," says Abigail Grace, research assistant focusing on Asia at the Centre for New American Security think media.
Syria "ready" for returning refugees, according to the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says that the country is ready to receive voluntary return refugees and pleads for help to build up the country, which lies in ruins after the more than seven years of war.
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country are now improving.
"The situation on the ground today is more stable and secure, thanks to our success in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to build up the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihood.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have moved to the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people who still live in the country need humanitarian support.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that it did not receive conditional support or assistance from countries that had supported the rebellion.
Europe won in the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by winning Team USA with the conclusion of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when the Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard during most of the tournament, ended up in the water at the outlet of the 16th pair of holes, and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all rounds and became one of four players who have ever done 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was introduced in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth hit 5 & 4 of the lowest ranking players of the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest ranking player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have made his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, who is a veteran with eight Ryder Cup behind him, became the most successful European ever with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed me.
I'm so glad, so glad to win back the victory.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could be of help," said a touching Garcia after the victory of the European team.
He left his staffing pins to his countryman John Ram who defeated the American golfer Tiger Woods 2+1 in a single on Sunday.
"What incredible pride to get Tiger Woods. I'm raised to look at him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four matches in France, and now has the result 13-21-3 for his career in Ryder Cup.
A special statistics for one of the world's best players ever, who has won 14 major titles, which has only been surpassed by Jack Nicklus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find a fairway, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after the team's downturning performance: "I'm proud of these guys they've fought.
It was time this morning when we raised the temperature in Europe.
We took the guy.
Hatred for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We're gonna regroup, I'm gonna work with the U.S. PGA tour and our Ryder Cup committee, and then we're gonna move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
You get to bow and bow.
They played better than we did."
Algebra Flower: The hold decreases in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Commission for Fisheries and Forestry shows a general reduction in concentrations of algal flowering for parts of the area around Tampa Bay.
According to the Commission, more uneven flowering is reported in the areas around the municipalities Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier.
The algal flower extends over 20 miles from the coast, from the north Pinellas to the south of Lee.
Flakes can be seen about one and a half miles out in the sea outside the large municipality of Hillsborough, but in fewer places compared to last week.
Algal flowering has also been observed in the municipality of Pasco.
Medium concentrations in or outside the coast of Pinellas have been reported in the past week. Outside the coast of Hillsborough are low to high concentrations, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee, background concentrations to high concentrations in or outside the coast of Sarasota, background concentrations to medium concentrations in or outside the coast of Lee, and low concentrations in Collier.
Reports of respiratory irritation continue to come from the municipalities Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in northwestern Florida last week.
