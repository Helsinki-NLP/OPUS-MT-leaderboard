Fire in French chemical plant destroyed
The Great Fire was destroyed in a chemical plant that was particularly dangerous in the northern French city of Rouen. This was shared by the prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire was blown up on Thursday night. No one was injured in the event. The fire fire was in use with about 200 discarded vehicles.

Rainers were called upon not to leave their homes. Buildings around 500 metres were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday. In the chemical plant on the shore of the Seine are produced additives for lubricants. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called EU Seveso Directive, which requires particularly strict safety requirements.
About 400 people are working in the work. The chemical factory has already provided a lot of power lines in the past - for example, as in 2013 by a leak the gas methanthyl developed and the environment was largely rocked by foul eggs. In 2015, after an operation accident, around 2,000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city's sewage system.
The woman announces her job to search for her missing dog 57 days
For two months, a woman from Washington was looking for her missing dog - and she announced her job extra. The seven-year-old Border Collie was left out of the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days missing every trace of the dog - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got sick," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake". She and her husband had left Hündin Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they returned to the hotel afterwards, Katie had disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Donner had moved a dog to panic
In hopes that Katie could stay somewhere else in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says: "She was away about four, four and a half hours ago," recalls Carole King against "Daily Inter Lake." When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie was immediately removed.
With flyers and phone calls in Facebook groups, the Kings searched for their beloved dog. However, days were weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake", who announced her job as a postman to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flow"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King received a call: A man reported and said that Katie was in his court. But when the King arrived there, Katie had already disappeared again. She searched for the neighborhood and suddenly stood her dog under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want her to go," King recalled, according to "Daily Inter Lake". "The tears flowed. People kept in their vehicles, rose out and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew that we had found her."
Losses in the Federal gun: Machine guns disappear without trace
Friday, September 27, 2019
Six MG3 machine guns are still missing.
In the past years, the German army has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of ammunition. Among them are three machine guns. In most cases, the stay is unclear. The opposition speaks of a "fearsome" extent.
In the Federal Armed Forces, weapons and ammunition are still disappearing - many of them are still untraceable. Since the beginning of 2014 the troops have booked the loss of 39 weapons, 39 weapons and nearly 20,000 ammunition. This is from a list of the Federal Defence Ministry, which reports on the German editorial network.
According to the paper from the Office of the Secretary of Defence Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one weapon and 3474 firearms were reappeared. In the case of weapons and weapons still missing, among other things, there are six MG3, eleven G3, four G36 guns, six G36 signal guns and two P8 guns. In addition, 30 MG3 machine guns are missing.
The volume of weapons and ammunition losses in the federal defence was "frightening", said left-wing deputy Martina Renner. This was so much more so, as in the course of investigations there was hardly anything found again. The left-wing politician spoke of a "necessary balance". The racer critic criticised the fact that the list did not recognize whether the missing ammunition was also those who had been found in connection with the investigations against the suspected federal defence officer Franco A.. "And although a supporter of Franco A. was recently convicted for the possession of this ammunition," said Renner.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As ship observation data from Refinitiv showed, the tanker moved and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was designated as the port of destination in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but it remained in Iranian waters for the first time. It was said that an official message was expected from Tehran.
On July 19th, the "Stena Impero" was ordered by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in the Hormuz Sea Street under the pretext of violating security regulations. However, it was suspected that Iran was reacting to the controversial, temporary establishment of an Iranian oil tanker in front of the British-owned Gibraltar.
The road of Hormuz is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the global oil exports are shipped by the sea. The tensions in the region have increased immensely in the past months. The trade was drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents with tanks and drones.
Merkel dignifies the courage of people in the peaceful revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has honoured the commitment of the people in the DDR who went on the road 30 years ago during the Peaceful Revolution. In the fall of 1989, courageous citizens would have awakened the then DDR regime, Merkel said at a party of the Thuringian CDU group on the upcoming day of the German Unity in Erfurt. The Chancellor recalled, among other things, the occupation of the Stasi Centre. "State security has been taken away from the terror," she said.
Musk seeks delivery record
Teslas quarter may hold record. Despite delivery boom, there was a loss in the electric car group last time.
New York.Tesla Chief Elon Musk gave his electric car group a strong boost to the stock exchange with the prospect of new records. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrec".
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110000 orders, it continued in Musks circulars. The challenge was to bring the cars to the know-how as soon as possible. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
The investors felt this: Tesla shares went with a plus of more than six percent of the trade. So strong the price has not been added for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered well 95000 cars and thus achieved its previous best value.
Musk needs a record to achieve his high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers have to be added in the current and coming quarter. Above all, the most affordable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are few winnings. Despite the boom, there has been a loss.
Solved puzzles: That's why we can't fuck ourselves
A kind of brake in the large brain prevents people from getting bitten by themselves. This was found by scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin with the help of experiments on rats, as they announced on Thursday night. Progress has also been made in the question of why children resist the potten just to demand more.
Finally, it has also shown why only the approach of a tickling hand triggers laughs before the touch. This lies at a deep layer in the large brain, which already triggers the laugh when the caterpillar expects.
According to the data, earlier research showed that rats react with "laughing" in the ultrasonic area when they are chained by humans. This "laughing" is mediated by the part of the large brain, which serves the central processing of the hapatic perception.
Laughing is suppressed during self-esteem
So far, it has been assumed that the brain can distinguish between self-touching and touch by others - that is why people cannot chew themselves. However, Berlin’s researchers have now found out in the experiments on rats that laughter is suppressed as well as the activity of the relevant area of the large brain during a self-touching. This is also so when living beings themselves are rubbing. During the alien touch and the hilt by scientists, the activity in the brain and the impulses have been strengthened.
However, pass the self-touching and touch through others at the same time, and the laugh is also suppressed. This indicates that the brain of the rat could not distinguish between the touch and touch by other. The new findings made it clear that people can not chew themselves because the touch of oneself activates a brake in the large brain.
The rats have also been trained to nipple themselves. Thus, sometimes in the experiment they interrupted this initiative early, showed flight behavior or fear stars. This ambivalentity is the same as the behavior of children. The ambivalentity of the kitzel is a behavioral reaction that is equal to that of rats and humans.
Disaster turned away: Great fire in French chemical plant destroyed
The Great Fire was destroyed in a chemical work that was particularly dangerous in the northern French city of Rouen. This was shared by the prefecture of the Normandy of the news agency AFP on Friday. The fire was blown up on Thursday night.
According to the authorities, no dangerous substances should be released. The samples taken do not give cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said on Friday morning at a press conference. No one was injured in the event. The firearm was in use with about 200 extinguishers.
Schools and kindergartens closed
The residents were summoned not to leave their houses. Buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first meeting in Parliament after the break of Wednesday morning. The Prime Minister is threatening to lead the country without an EU agreement on 31 October, Brussels should not commit itself to its demands for amendments to the Brexit Agreement, but as he wants to achieve this, it is unclear.
About Cox, who used to stay in the European Union in Britain, the prime minister said: "The best way to honor Jo Cox's memory and make this country one again would be to complete the EU exit". Cox was murdered by a law extremist during the referendum campaign in 2016.
Mammoths for strokes of Oslo and Utöya are revealed
More than eight years after the strokes in Oslo and Utöya with 77 deaths, on Saturday in Norway, a wave is revealed to honor the victims. The monument "Jerner rose" (German: the Iron Roses) consists of about 1,000 iron rose formations. They remember the roses that had been laid by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks before the dome in Oslo.
In the same place, the project of the artist Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is now to be discovered - the roses were cast by people from all over the world, including survivors and victims. For opening, among other things, the Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit are expected.
On 22 July 2011, law-terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first fired a car bomb in the Oslo government district and followed by the island of Utöya dozens of participants from a youth camp of the Social Democratic Workers' Party.
Iran gives British tankers free
The UN General debate did not solve the Iran conflict, but now there is a smaller problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" in Iran could re-enter the lake. It could be a puzzle in the peace plan of Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero", which has been on the road of Hormus in Iran since mid-July, has been back in international waters. Following the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as the Reederei Stena Bulk reported.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now driving, among other things, for medical examinations to Dubai, explained Reedereief Erik Hånell. On the afternoon, the ship has left the Iranian waters. "Sweet that it is over," he told the Swedish television broadcaster SVT.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London called the establishment of the ship illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to affect the freedom of the sea. We work with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said a statement on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had ordered the tanker on July 19th under the pretext to disregard the rules of the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members were already released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members are doing well according to the circumstances, Hånell said. They had behaved professionally in the face of the difficult and exhilarating situation in the past ten weeks. The journey now works to bring them back together with their families as quickly as possible.
Following the establishment of the "Stena Impero", the British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in Britain's Gibraltar: in early July there was a supertanker with oil from Iran that was supposed to have been placed on the chain for Syria.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Motives, it was an exchange business to get the "Stena Impero" released, London said strongly.
The road of Hormus is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the world's oil exports are being shipped by the sea. The tensions in the region have increased immensely in the past months. The trade vessel has been drawn into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents involving tanks and drones.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear dispute between the two countries. The Americans are pushing the Iranian leadership to build nuclear weapons. Iran is behind this. In 2018, the United States was alone in the entry of the International Atomic Agreement, which prevented Iran from building an atomic bomb and at the same time should end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the U.S. government has put the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country under pressure to force a more stringent and extended agreement on other areas.
Because of the conflict around the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the United States is working on a coalition for military protection of commercial ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for security and peace on the road to Hormus at the UN plenary meeting in New York. With the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran wants to ensure the security of the Gulf.
India unites with its protectionist economic policy for a better future.
In view of the penalties imposed by President Donald Trump against Chinese producers, India would be forced to dispose of foreign producers in the People's Republic. Asian financial heads who are considering moving their production from China to another country call India in a survey of the UBS as one of the preferred alternatives. This is freely not only about the uncertainties of the Chinese-American trade war. With a giant pool of young workers, as well as an internal market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to have created a more significant role in the global chain of production.
But now India itself is focused on Trump. From the Haudegen in the White House, devalued as "the Kingdom of Customs", America has withdrawn trade benefits for 2000 products at the beginning of June. The United States prohibits high customs duties and demands better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the World Map of Trade Wars, the rails with India are free of charge a side-view. In addition, America looks at the world's largest democracy also through the security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington connect the concern over China's power claims in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a Salve U.S. penalty fee against India is unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just arrived for a second five-year term, should therefore move safely.
The problem lies elsewhere: The empirically hardened thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a difficult position in the socialist Republic of India. Also under fashion. Its reformer focuses mainly on the bureaucratic confusion that has been stifling every entrepreneurial spirit in the state for too long. Firms are now given faster construction permits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more aggressive insolvency and competition law creates conditions for the early liquidation of emerging companies with high debts.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the appropriate rankings. From an economic perspective, much has been achieved in India in the first five years of fashion. However, trade policy does not apply. It is suggested that international firms should protect themselves from foreign suppliers, the national conservative government even set up new barriers.
In the West, the mode of the Nimbus of the energetic reformer, whose country is economically radically renewed, depends on the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows only too well what Vokabular likes Western managers. In the core, however, the "India First" lawyer never withdrew from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian firms from being forced to relax anachronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition. Business people who survive due to the destruction of their industries are among the tribal voters of the Bharatiya Janata Party's nationalist mode and complain about these short-term policies.
Addendum by Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
The former French President Jacques Chirac is scheduled to attend a report in Paris next week. The former head of state will be occupied on Monday at the Friedhof Montparnasse in the south of the French capital, the news agency AFP reported on the appeal to the Chiracs family. The property will be held in a close family circle. On Sunday a public mourning party was held in Paris's disability, as media reported.
Targeted to competitors: Dabo is the first secret hero of the Light Athletics World
The World Summit was long over the goal of playing hot scenes in the cooled Khalifa International Stadium. In the first run of the men over 5000 metres, Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to swing dangerously. He could hardly hold himself on his legs, while Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly stopped him and supported him in the final half of the stadium. However, after the finish of the race, both forces managed to stop the current bracelet. As if the scene had not been enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same thing," said Dabo after racing in the Mixed Zone, when he completely unexpectedly drew the attention of the gathered journalists. He was shy at first, he didn't even want to talk about his heroism. Finally, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he noticed that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help a suffering companion. And yet he would be proud to represent his country, which was invited by the World Trade Union. Under normal circumstances he would not have even started. "That's why I'm proud to run here for my country," he said.
He did this in the evening with emphasis - and much more intense than he had thought it would be. Because this herotat will remain in memory. At the end of the day, Dabo even gave his rival busby the goal and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, well five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this course. He enjoyed nothing at the end, because the busby who came to the goal with much help was disqualified at the end of the World Light League.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies there in Lisbon, was present to establish a personal best time at the WM in Doha. According to official data with 18:10.87 minutes, he was disappointed himself: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. Under 18 minutes I was already in practice." However, only in training, there are no best times.
Million Mask: Egyptians equip themselves for wild protest days
In Egypt, security measures have been strengthened in advance of possible government-critical protests. In the centre of Cairo, an increased police presence was observed on Friday. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square have been blocked.
Already in the past days the police had strengthened their road checks and partially searched the phones of pedestrians for news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds of non-governmental organizations were reportedly arrested.
Opponent of Al-Sisi
Last weekend it was in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura to protest with hundreds of participants. They addressed the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic of corruption and mismanagement. There had been no such open protest against political leadership in Egypt for years. The Egyptian construction contractor and actor Mohammed Ali, who led the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, called for a "million march" on Friday in central places in the country. Ali is calling for a "People's Revolution". The man is also not "gooder, because he is a subcontractor for the army, but comes to millions of messages.
The number of arrests related to the protests continued to rise according to two observer groups. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. These numbers were not confirmed at first. The government also did not comment on the figures.
Vulnerable arrests
Many people have been "willfully arrested", "only because they were "falsely in the wrong place at the wrong time", HRW informed the detainees in appeal to lawyers. The allegations against the detainees are based on the statements of their lawyers from "dissemination of false information" to membership in a "terrorist association". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces were questioned and searched in uniform, but also in civilian clothing, according to HRW indications, as well as voluntary passers-by.
HRW also criticised the censorship in the North African country. Thus, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online Dealer: Resellers should be able to donate returns more easily
For online traders, many returned packages are lost. Around 20 million returns are thus landed on the trash. However, there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online traders like Amazon and Zalando how they can donate returned products instead of destroying them.
Although the companies could not be exempted from the sales tax on cash, the ministry explained a question of the Greens-Bundtags Group, which was reported on Friday by the Funke-Media Group newspapers, but the traders could use the market value of the non-sales returns so low that they should not or should not pay any sales tax.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had found that the federal citizens would return every six packages when ordered on the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - around 20 million products - then land in the trash. To contribute, the companies would cost extra money after the current legal situation, because the financial authorities assess experts as a revenue that then affects sales tax.
Green Group Chief Katrin Göring-Eckardt asked Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with an admission that companies can not assess products for sale and donate them free of charge to non-profit organizations. Companies should be able to rely on not being punished for donations. This applies not only to online trading, but also to other business from the model to the construction market.
Banksy art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", will soon be done.
For Branczyk, Banksys underlines the work "the re-formulation of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world in the basics of animals and strains". From Saturday the painting at Sotheby's is to be exhibited in the British capital until it is to be auctioned on October 3. It is estimated at EUR 1.5 million to two million.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in South West Britain, where Banksy lives. This year the artist had re-issued the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29. On this occasion the work, previously called "Question Hour", was renamed "Devolved Parliament" ("Delegated Parliament").
The image could change the owner for a million.
Last Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson delivered a hard fight with the opposition at the first meeting of the House following the cancellation of a forced break by Johnson by the Supreme Court. Johnson wants to complete the Brexit already moved twice on 31 October, if necessary without agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, is involved in Brexit's debate. In Dover in the southeast of England he painted a picture that represents a man who breaks a star with a missile of the European flag. The work sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors every day when entering the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
In his opinion, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's intense verbal attacks on Brexit opponents in Parliament did not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the fight before the Brexit referendum 2016, the current controversy was a "walk in the park", Dominic Cummings said on Friday in a book presentation. "We enjoy it. We will leave (from the EU) and we will win".
Johnson had severely attacked Brexit opponents in Parliament in the past few days and had put them, among other things, "trait" on the people, accused him of endangering the MPs, because they could be targeted by murder threats, he turned down as "humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to return to rest is if the Members would finally respect the British decision to withdraw from the EU, and it is not surprising that the people were concerned that Britain had not yet left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the uplifted mood on Friday, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for a rebuff. "We should speak with respect to each other," said a statement. "And we should also listen."
Pakistan Prime Minister Khan calls for non-interventions in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan again called upon the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict in his first appearance before the UN.
Otherwise, a new war was likely between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India, Khan said on Friday at the UN General's debate in New York. "If this is bad, hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented this."
India and Pakistan have waged three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of which are in the region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers dominate a part of Kashmir, another part of which belongs to China. At the beginning of August India had withdrawn the autonomy status of the Indian Kashmir region and thus significantly increased tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo demand the fall of the Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts with hard hands. It shoots at the population with sharp ammo, over 2000 prisoners are sent to prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already there. Protests were never safe in Egypt. However, since the adoption of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus is doing everything to avoid a scenario such as the times of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the protests in 2011 was the bad economic situation. Poverty, impatience and the feeling of being suffocated by the government itself drove millions to the streets. And this is a problem that also does not get into the grip of the el-Sisi regime, no matter how hard it is against opponents. The situation has even worsened.
Today, every third of Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. Whoever wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must decide who is financed: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the oppression but also the biggest economic actor. The military builds streets, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. That was before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, also the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. Critical always when large parts of the population have difficulties, it is at all to cope with a bottle of water.
Tüv tests in the terminal: BER-Chief: No more "showstopper" for main city airports
Two months have been checked whether the complex compound of the BER fire protection system works in combination. The operators are satisfied with the course. However, the tire is not yet finished at the BER.
After major Tüv tests in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October of the following year. This is certain, supervisor Rainer Bretschneider said after a meeting of the control body.
Airport chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful completion of the test, but also said that there were still gaps in the terminal. "We have many detailed themes, but we don't have a real show stop." He assured, the schedule until the start of the operation still contains buffers.
However, there is evidence that the temporary reserve should no longer be too large. The construction display is now to be submitted to the construction office during the first quarter of 2020, at the beginning of the year, this was planned for this fall.
Hundreds of flaws in power cables are still to be repaired; the Tüv wants to examine them until February. "To create the conditions for taking the flight operation here, it is still necessary to work intensively on the handling of the flaws," said a written statement.
Lütke Daldrup said, in many cases it is missing evidence, less new cables. There is still no release for all dübels on which the cable paths hang. The airport manager expects it to be present by the end of the year.
In addition, fire protection at the crossing to the train station is still not satisfactory under the terminal. The problems had already led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time, it is about smoking shortcuts that go down in a fire like a lion wall so that the smoke does not spread. They drive too far down. 36 engines therefore need to be replaced. Then there should be new tests with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other tree weaknesses as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it should start operating in 2011. The costs have risen from two billion to about 6.5 billion euros since the beginning of 2006 for the next year.
As passenger numbers in Berlin have increased significantly since then, those responsible plan to expand the airport. Therefore, it should be held at a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as announced by the Chairman of the Bretschneider.
The airport company is now looking for two new managers. Financier Heike Fölster is changing to the German Railway at the end of the year, Staff Manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen is going to Rente next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster.
Chemnitz: Automated for drugs - Police arrest
He needed money for drugs - and hunted several machines in the Chemnitz city area for it! Now the offender is finally in jail!
Over the past two years, the number of blown-up cigarette and parking machines in Chemnitz and the region has risen sharply.
After two detonations at the end of May, the police arrested a 33-year-old German on the public street and on the future street in Chemnitz.
Police spokesperson Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of investigations into the occurrence of explosive explosions in Tatheonite with a particularly serious case of theft conducted by the Chemnitzer Criminal Police, this suspicion was not only confirmed against the 33-year-olds".
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer was now a total of eight acts.
The police spokesperson: "With the spoils he has apparently financed his addiction" The bomb only four times between 20 August 2018 and 31 May 2019 had car parked on the streets.
The total damage incurred is at least EUR 60,000!
The automatic bomber is now under investigation. Police investigations are continuing against him.
It is believed that he was also responsible for further automatic jumps in Chemnitz and adjacent country circles.
AUA takes Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is reviving its strategy for the Vienna airport. In the middle of the price struggle with cheap flights such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, Lufthansa's daughter AUA "the commercial management of all Eurowings flights from Vienna" confirmed on Friday a press spokesman from Austrian Airlines against the APA. Previously reported on this "AirationNetOnline".
The Vienna base of the Eurowings Lufthansa-Cheap Flight will thus be de facto dissolved. Four of the current seven Eurowings aircraft will remain in Vienna. This will take over the AUA from January 2020 in the "Wetlease", including Eurowings staff. Three Eurowings jets will be stationed in Salzburg to fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter machines to holiday destinations. Routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA circuit and network planning, the speaker said. The flight times are intended to be aligned on connecting flights. The aim is to strengthen the Vienna circuit and expand the decentralised traffic from the Federal countries.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna are only "Production Company" for the AUA Group Sisters. This would include Barcelona and Rome with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings. The board product should be adapted to those Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and flight attendants come from Eurowings. The Eurowings flights starting with the AUA flight number are no longer reported in Terminal 1, but as the AUA in Terminal 3.
At the Vienna airport, a price struggle broke out after Niki-Pleite. The Ryanair daughter Laudamotion announced on Thursday only that the fleet in Vienna would jump to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish airliner sends four Ryanair machines and Crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which the trade union criticised as an operating structure for the collective agreement.
Air Force Commander Michael O'Leary's campaign that Lauda has overhauled the AUA in five years was met on Friday by Andreas Otto: "We remain the number one at the location, in five, six or ten years".
Queen-Enkelin Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four is married. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: At the beginning of the month's Italian holiday, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) was supposed to have stopped at the hands of his girlfriend Princess Beatrice (31).
"We are extremely happy to be able to announce our engagement. We are both so happy to start this adventure together and we can hardly expect to be actually married," the couple, who have been together in the official communication since British media reports since October 2018, said.
And further: "We share so many similar interests and values, and we know that this will help us very much in the coming years of love and happiness".
Sister Eugenie cut the pictures
The official engagement photos have been published by her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also on her Instagram account.
A Royal Feast
The wedding will take place in 2020. More information about date, place and everything else will be announced in the coming months.
But it is certain that the narration of the number nine of the British thrones and the real estate mogul will be a similar great feast as the wedding of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy nutrition - there are risk factors for heart circulation diseases. But what really causes a heart failure or a heart attack? Hamburger researchers now want to see the heritage of 9000 healthy and sick people exactly.
Through the analysis of the heritage of 9000 people, Hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to learn more about the causes of cardiovascular diseases.
The research project was the largest of these types in the German-speaking area, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation supports the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland are the Davos High Mountain Clinic, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital in Zurich.
Excessive weight, smoking and unhealthy nutrition are among the essential risk factors for heart circulation diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. But the interaction between genes and external influences is not well known, it was called. Now scientists want to compare the complete inheritance of 8,000 healthy people with the 1,000 former patients of the University's heart and vessel center at the UKE.
Currently, in more than 4,000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes, possible disease-induced changes in DNA - called mutations - are known, it was called from the clinic.
The objective of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart failure and heart attacks. The data could also be used in researching other people’s diseases, according to Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University’s heart and vessel center. New findings on the interaction between the heart and the brain, the heart and the kidney as well as cancer are possible.
The head of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there is a strong will to use the data to investigate other diseases. The Kühne Foundation's clinic in Davos treats allergies so far. Now a center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine should be created and a professor of bioinformatics created. For reasons of his involvement, the logistics operator in Switzerland said that he had been operating at the open heart three years ago in Hamburg.
The bioassays of healthy participants come from Hamburgers who also participate in the Hamburg City Health Study. With 45,000 experts, according to the clinic, this is the world's largest local health study. In the case of inheritance encryption, strictly respect for the protection of anonymous data, the scientists assured. It is about a petabyte (1000 terabyte) of data, Holger Moch said from the University Hospital Zurich.
According to the UKE, a person's genetic heritage can be decrypted within 24 hours. The net cost of this is 1,300 euros. The first generation sequence worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, still cost hundreds of millions of euros. The study is scheduled to start on 1 October, by the end of 2020 all 9000 samples will be analysed.
Nigerian police free hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, the police freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koranic school. According to residents, security forces searched the school in the northern city of Kaduna and discovered the still minor victims, as police spokesperson Yakubu Sabo reported. "The victims were abused. Some of them reported being raped by their teachers," Sabo said.
The boys were detained under the pretext to be taught in the Qur'an and be "improved". In fact, their teachers were detained under "the most reprehensible and inhumane conditions", Sabo said. About a hundred students, including nine-year-olds, were chained in a small space.
The Koran School has been in keeping with the data for about ten years. Residents would have paid attention to repeated irregularities in the institution. The parents were shocked when they were informed about the situation in the Koran school, Sabo said. They had nothing to do with the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to the police.
In the predominantly Muslim northern Nigeria, there are many private Korans. They often replace the lack of state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed bands. According to the UN Refugee Relief Agency, therefore, over the past ten months more than 40,000 people have fled across the border in the neighbouring state of Niger.
Jailed and tortured: Nigeria Police Released 400 Children from School
In a school in northern Nigeria, police officers have freed nearly 400 students from essential conditions. "Many of them were chained and some of them had visible injuries that indicated torture," said police spokesperson Yakubu Sabo in the city of Caduna.
The children were discovered there on Thursday after a report in an Islamic school. The conditions were "inhumane" there. The officials found the school leader and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all young, were kept in their school as slaves and placed on chains. Some were sexually abused. Television images showed distraught and injured students in a noticeable poor health condition.
World football election: Further rejections to Messis and Klopps Kör
Invalid signature.
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a Gala in Milan, the Fifa World Football Association marks the best player, the best player and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honour and thus record.
After Nicaragua's captain explained that he had never voted in the World Cup election, rejections to the Fifa from other countries came. Egypt was not valued - with a good reason.
Many of the Fifa's past years have proved rich: the WM awards, the dubious plans of its president Gianni Infantino, the general behavior of various corrupt officials. However, the Fifa World Football elections do not so far seem to be suspicious of the fact that it is a matter of doubt - if you do not agree that the qualified national trainers and national team captains of the member associations often agree on sympathies rather than on objective estimates.
But after Nicaragua's captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, further inconveniences now arise: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah have not been taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting overview.
The Fifa apologises that "the signatures on the ballot forms have been issued in capital letters and therefore not valid". The Egyptian association has been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without an answer.
Sudan Trainer also surprised
There is also an appeal from Sudan regarding the election. While the case is to be settled in the case of Egypt, the Sudanese association states that Trainer Zdravko Lugarisic has not voted as it was finally assessed: with Lionel Messi on the spot one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. According to Fifa, the vote was also taken, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese association.
In his case it was suspected that the Nicaraguan football association had just voted in his name. He had also voted for the preamble of Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera: "Have not voted for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the details of my vote are wrong, thank you," he wrote.
From the association came the message now on Friday: Right, but of course there was no intention. The filled election documents were "unreasonably" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan election, was provided in a communication from the association. But he chose the second captain Manuel Rosas. "We take responsibility for the administrative errors," said the communication. Rosas and team trainer Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, "just as it is in the official list of FIFAs".
The other cases are now being examined by the Fifa in an investigation, but it stresses that the election process has been supervised externally by the consultant PriceWaterhouseCoopers. For so long Lionel Messi remains the undisputed winner of the World Football Election - and Jürgen Klopp World Coach of the year.
Ukrainian affairs: High-ranking Republicans speak for official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have openly declared themselves for an official investigation against the US presidents and partner friends Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican Governor of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Wherever the facts are derived from here are determined by the facts found." He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affair before taking action. An impeachment procedure can lead to the President's resignation.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations. He had shown that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selensky to investigate the activities of the democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. Scott observed Trump Biden "for years".
The Republicans have so far abstained from criticizing Trump because of the Whistleblower affair, only a few of them have dissatisfaction with it. Scott's statements are now a first sign of this in Trump's party. In doing so, the moderate governor of Virginia had repeatedly turned against Trump's policies, such as the release of environmental protection legislation and the strengthening of immigration legislation.
As another senior Republican, Charlie Baker, governor of Massachusetts, also spoke out for the investigation. "It is a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right way and responsibility for Congress is now to investigate the matter and to go to the ground."
Scott and Baker, as the governor of the U.S. states, have not formally cooperated in the process against Trump, which will be decided on at the Congress. Their statements are therefore particularly symbolically important. However, the first senators of the Republicans also expressed themselves critically about the situation. For example, Romney, who represents the Utah Federal State in the second Chamber, said that the case is "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing". US media also reports that the Republicans are acting under internal first rice.
The affair could lead to the initiation of an anti-Trup procedure, which the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation, and they are using it for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the procedure. With the majority of them in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could strive for a so-called impeachment. However, the decision on an actual procedure fell in the Senate, where Trump Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore limited. So far no US President has been elected by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
Were torturers on board of rockets "Sea Watch"?
Three men were arrested in Sicily, allegedly raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German Captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after having illegally boarded the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees. After fierce protests and international criticism - including by Austrian Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now there are new heavy props against rockets. In this way, three men who were subjected to torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived with the Sea Watch 3 in Italy. The suspects were captured in a detention camp in Messina, Sicily, after the migrants had recognized their tormentors in Italy. "We can't exclude this, but we don't even have safe information," said "Sea Watch" spokesperson Ruben Neubuilder of the German Press Agency.
From the police in mid-September it was said that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured and even killed. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and subjected to grueling - through repeated and constant physical violence," the statement said.
NGOs and relief organizations now point out that they cannot know exactly who is on the ship. "We cannot scan who are the people. They come without passports," said Newbuilder. Torture is one of the main reasons why people flee from Libya. It is therefore quite likely that there are also perpetrators on the ships. "It is therefore very important that we follow it".
Italy's right-wing former Interior Minister Matteo Salvini called for an immediate apology for rockets against which aid for illegal immigration is still being identified in Italy.
Musk seeks delivery record at Tesla
Tesla Chief Elon Musk has given his electric car group a strong boost to the stock exchange with the prospect of new record numbers.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrec".
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it continued in Musks circulars. The challenge was to bring the cars to the know-how as soon as possible. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
The investors felt this: Tesla shares went with a plus of more than six percent of the trade. So strong the price has not been added for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95,000 cars and thus achieved its previous best value.
Musk needs a record to achieve his high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers have to be added in the current and coming quarter year. Above all, the most affordable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are few gains. Despite the boom, there was a loss.
US budget dispute: Only bridge financing again
The new financial year will start in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget. On Thursday, the Senate followed the House of Representatives and decided to grant transitional funding until 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to an increase in spending ceilings for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States was once again there without spending plans beginning on 1 October. On Thursday, the Senate followed the House of Representatives and decided on a transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision it would have come to a shutdown on Monday afternoon, a partial closure of the federal administration. President Trump still has to implement the decision.
Shutdown is delineated
In the meantime, the Federal Administration is currently funded at the level and in line with the priorities of the spending plans for the coming financial year to end on Monday 2019. This is because the Congress has not been able to allocate funds to the various departments and authorities in due course to the 12 expenditure laws. Therefore, the Federal Administration cannot benefit from the increased expenditure framework for the new financial year from 1.3 Bio. to 1.4 Bio.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives where they have the majority. However, the laws of expenditure reflect the priorities of the Democrats who have little chance in the Senate dominated by the Republicans.
The ghosts are mainly divided on the issue of resource allocation for the area of domestic security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicans are obviously trying to force $12 billion for the construction of the wall, one of the major priorities of President Trump. The democrats are interfering with the construction plans and the financing that is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The fight over the construction of the wall was already scaled up in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
The Spirits Separate in the Wall Construction
Now it is unclear how the parties want to get closer to this issue. Probably more than an agreement on all twelve spending laws in the coming seven weeks is an extension of transitional funding beyond 21 November. A shutdown is not excluded at the same time.
In the light of the continuing inability of the Congress to agree in time to the twelve expenditure laws, and the consequent danger of a shutdown win ideas to automate the process of popularity. Template S. 1877 to avoid shutdowns would automatically continue the financing of the federal administration at the previous year's level, suspend the parliamentary activities and withhold their wages until the new annual spending plans are proposed.
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertilization is to be opened to women living alone and lesbians in the future: the Paris National Assembly agreed with a large majority for a legislative proposal by the government, after which all women can engage in in vitro fertilization.
The proposal still needs the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right-wing camp had warned that many "children without a father" could grow up in the future.
The new scheme is the core component of a bioethics law, which Minister of Health Agnès Buzyn defended as "a chance" for society. It is the modern family in which children with only one parent or homosexual parents are provided. According to their imagination, the cost of artificial abortions for all women should be borne by social insurance.
Prohibit further fertilization with sperm from dead husband
With a short majority, however, the National Assembly rejected an amendment to allow widows for artificial fertilization to access the sperm of their dead man. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, artificial fertilization is permitted "post-mortem". In Germany, in the past, there were cases where women allegedly complained about the release of the sperm of a deceased man. The opponents of the introduction in Paris argued that a child who was so born bears a "very heavy fate".
Many members of the Government Party La Republika en Marche (The Republic in Movement, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had, however, expressed themselves for the artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow would be subjected to "double grief" if her husband's death did not satisfy her child's desire.
The initiators of the now failed amendment find it unfair that a widow may be fertilized with an unknown sperm, but not with her own partner in the future.
So far, the artificial fertilization in France is allowed only heterosexual couples who cannot bear children. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that the marriage continues to be prohibited.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretically open to all women - for single or lesbian couples it is still often difficult.
Compensation for the climate: calls for flight delivery for unis become louder
There is a lot of flying at the universities, which is why the country is going to have to pay an air-conditioning fee there in the future. The directors say they don't have any money for it. But now they are also under pressure.
Schools should also be limited when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Street School
The discussion that took place before the summer break on climate change on flights from universities and universities returns. After the country-director conference had responded sceptically to a corresponding advance from the Green-Black Coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctors from six Baden-Württemberg universities and a pedagogical university are pleading for compensation for service flights. This was the first step "emergingly necessary", while there was a wide debate on the avoidability of flights, in their opinion. The cabinet decision planned in July is based on the fact that the CDU has not yet approved the proposal of the Greens.
Russia re-establishs North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB secret service, the detainees were supposed to have illegally fished in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen were arrested from North Korea. At that time there was a shooting between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later suffered serious injuries. This time, however, there were no casualties, it was called.
The Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages. North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way to Russian high seas. There, the Russian Coast Guard is carrying out its own activities to protect its marine biological resources.
30,000 bluefin tuna caught
During the re-checks, 30,000 ink fish were discovered and seized on the boats. In addition, three fishing and two motor boats were seized and Nachodka and Posjet were brought to Vladivostok.
Russian Fisheries Authority did not issue any fishing licences to North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs. Thousands of North Korean fishermen have been detained there for some time this year.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the remote Primorje region, Georgi Martynow, recently complained about also high environmental damage by North Korean fishermen. They fished narrow synthetic nets forbidden in Russia. These would also fetch small creatures from the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be removed from the sea where they needed 200 years to be installed.
In the future, only 18,000: USA decreases the asylum ceiling
The "largest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country on earth is falling short of those seeking protection: As confirmed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Washington, the upper limit on the legal withdrawal of refugees will be further reduced. In the future, it will be expected to receive threatened believers and Iraqi asylum.
The U.S. government wants to reduce the historically low threshold for the admission of new refugees once again. In the 2020 financial year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, there will be no more than 18,000 people left in the country, as the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs has stated. In the current almost recent financial year, the limit is still around 30,000 people.
The government of President Donald Trump has dramatically reduced the availability of protection seekers from all over the world in the past years. Under the previous government of Barack Obama, there had been far higher coverage limits.
The stated ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the U.S. refugee programme in 1980. Nevertheless, the U.S. foreign ministry referred to the US as "the most merciful and generous nation in history", a formulation that strongly recalls the use of the official US president.
A "responsibly responsible" approach to refugees aims at allowing refugees to return to their home countries to help rebuild there, Trump said. For his hard course in migration policy, he is getting a lot of demands from his followers, but there are also massive criticisms.
A major point of dispute is the border to Mexico that wants to remove Trump. To finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the national emergency. Whether there is a temporary connection between the current measure and the current internal political developments in the U.S. capital, it is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure due to the selensky business and a potentially threatening settlement procedure.
The U.S. government intends to focus on the admission of two refugee groups in the future: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus in danger, as stated in the statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, there should be a maximum of 1500 refugees.
The United States wants to achieve that people from this "north triangle" of Central America apply for asylum in other countries. Before this background, the United States has only signed with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras migration agreements to slow down migration to Mexico at the US southern border.
Court orders the release of orange-utan from zoo
An orange-Utan woman was transferred from the former Buenos Aires Zoo to a detention station for human assaults in the United States at the request of the Argentine Justice. The "Sandra" born in the Rostocker Zoo in 1986 was granted the rights of a "non-human person" and was therefore forced to release. The animal was brought by direct flight to Dallas on Thursday evening - not as a passenger, but in the cargo room, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53 kilograms of hard-earned people are not able to adapt to life in the wilderness, they are expected to live in Florida for great monkeys in the future. There are already 21 other oranges and 31 chimpanzees, among them "Bubbles", former pets of Popstar Michael Jackson. However, before entering Florida, "Sandra" has to take another 40-day quarantine in the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the U.S. state of Kansas.
"Sandra" spent several years after her birth in Rostock in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen, before moving her to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process of "Sandras" fundamental rights by animal protectors in 2014 has contributed to the transformation of the zoo of Buenos Aires into an ecopark. By 2023, a research and education centre will be established to maintain diversity.
Record for Swiss Extrembergeiger: 550 meters in 46 minutes
At the almost 3,000-metre big dinner in the Italian Alps, the Extremberger Dani Arnold is happy with a new house ride.
Without net, double floor or other aids, the Swiss connects the 550 meters high north wall of the large tin in a new record time.
Cloaked with Jeans, T-shirt and supported only by absolute freedom of movement, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the climb. He offered the old best brand in almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder in the Free Solo Speed at four of the six most important European northern walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
In spite of the trade conflict with China, the US sports producer Nike has booked a clear profit supplement. Net profit increased to $1.4 billion in the past quarter (nearly €1.3 billion). This is 25 percent more than in the previous year, as the Group announced on Tuesday. This is especially the reason for this is the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor directs its customers online.
Turnovers rose to $10.7 billion in the three-month period until the end of August. The strongest added the Nike sales figures with a plus of 22 percent in China. Thus, the Beaverton Group in the U.S. state of Oregon also benefited in the People's Republic from its approach to addressing consumers directly via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Financial Chief Andy Champion announced that Nike will continue to promote the "digital transformation" of the sport product manufacturer with strategic investments and thus expand its competitive advantage. The investors responded happily to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sports product manufacturer increase by more than five percent.
Lifelong stadium ban for racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football pro Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the association from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong stadium ban on a fan. The defending Jesus from Brazil was ridiculed by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and asked his club to take action. "@officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToracism. Proud to be who I am," wrote the 28-year-old who has been playing at AS Rome since 2016.
The association reacted late Thursday. He reported the account of the fans at Instagram and the police. Moreover, the Roma supporters should never visit a game of the association again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Regularly scant Italian fans racist harassment against black players of rivaling teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sport. In Italy the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. You have to identify the responsible ones and throw them out of the stadiums," said Fifa President Gianni Infantino on the weekend. The occasion of the speech was racist songs at the Firstliga Party between Atalanta Bergamo and the AC Florence on the previous Sunday.
But also around the adherents of Juventus Turin there had been discussions last. The Italian authorities now have 38 Randalling Fans of Recordmaster Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them should no longer enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police reported. For the others, bans of four to seven years apply.
Fans are associated with ongoing investigations against 12 leaders of Ultra-Fan groups in the area of Juventus. The twelve are subjected to heavy repression, money laundering and private violence. The club had the investigations carried out last year.
The ultra-leaders should stick the ticket to the black market after Italian media reports. They would have "militarized" the ticket trade for the fan curve and should have pressured Juventus employees to come to cheaper cards.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millenniums are narcissistic, generation Z is political - all years are thought of with gripping terms. Looking more closely, the awards are filled with contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the respective sense of life of young people?
"The crabs are coming!" On September 21st, the official opening ceremony of the Gucheng-see in Gaochun was launched, and the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival was invited, as announced by the Department of Public Works of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern foothill of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ecologically ideal conditions with a mix of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
In the early 1990s, people in Gaochun started to develop cancer. In the course of time, the cancer industry has developed into a promising industry that provided high income and has become an important component of the economic development of Gaochun. In the past years, Gaochun has been actively involved in the large, ecological and scientific development of cancer disease and in a technically supported cancer disease. And the city has taken care of promoting more efficiency in agriculture and the income of farmers.
In recent years, Gaochun has introduced a reform to "distribution of power, optimization of administration and authorities" and has carefully built the service network for "authorisation under a roof, a criminal prosecution team, a service network, a credit-supply platform", thus optimizing the environment for approvals, services and development.
Gaochun creates the advantages given on the site by connecting to the southern Jiangsu and the southern Anhui and using the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as an outpost, to promote intelligent high-end tourism enterprises, companies for biomedical and medical technology, energy storage and environmental protection, from the cultural and health sectors as well as farms for ecological agriculture, which are leading in the "3+2" area. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the construction of a national, all-area tourist museum and by foreign transport sites of national importance. The ecological and cultural resources of the landscape of Gaochun are integrated into the "3+2" area. At the same time, the state of the building of a national, all-area-wide tourist museum and foreign transport sites of national importance. The development of Gaochun's natural resources of Gaochun's landscape and the "res development and development" have been promoted to promote the development of tourism and development of the "geurism".
Conflict between Iran and the United States: Ruhani speaks of the end of sanctions - Trump opposes
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani spoke after his return from the UN plenary meeting of an alleged offer by the United States to abolish sanctions. In return for talks with the Tehran leadership, Ruhani said on his official website.
However, U.S. President Donald Trump objected to the Iranian co-worker on Twitter: "I wanted Iran to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the event as follows: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and had insisted that a meeting would take place. "And America says I am lifting the sanctions," added Ruhani. The type of criminal measures to be completed has been discussed. "And they have clearly said that we are raising all the sanctions."
However, in an acceptable way, Ruhani criticised this approach. In view of the criminal measures in force and the "poisoned atmosphere of the maximum pressure", no one could predict the outcome of the negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York. Background was the hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear agreement with Iran negotiated with Russia and China. This was intended to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. Like Merkel, President Emmanuel Macron had expressed hope that Ruhani would meet with US President Donald Trump.
Heavy earthquakes near Istanbul - Fast 200 neighbours
After the recent shock of two earthquakes, the fear of a disaster grows. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the earthquake on the eve of the day, there have been almost 200 attacks, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday. This is how concern for a disaster grows.
14 schools in Istanbul have been closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings have been damaged. The 5.8 earthquake of strength had shaken the Marmara region in front of Istanbul on Thursday and triggered panic in the million metropolis. Now the government wants to set up a commission to prepare the country for earthquakes better in the future, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been prepared enough to fight, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imagoglu. In the city itself, the latent danger is always ignored. Every year poorly built homes are broken down – among other things, must be made by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
City planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have warned for years that large open areas registered in the centre as places of refuge have been built for a long time. Only until the 20th anniversary of the Golcük baby in August had the Istanbul Building Engineering Chamber warned that estimated a million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake safe.
The epicenter of the earthquake from Thursday was in the Marmarameer in front of the Silivri district and in about seven kilometers deep, as the disaster protection authority Afad reported. A smaller neighboring village provided a few minutes later for even greater panic on the streets.
The Istanbul Mayor Akrem Imagoglu was not notified on Twitter, injured or injured. The TRT sent out showed people who ran out of houses in panic. Students were brought out of the buildings for security reasons in Silivri district. Some students were crying as if they were looking at pictures.
Istanbul is considered particularly at risk of an earthquake. Under the Marmara Sea is a section of the so-called Northern Anatolic Disorder, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolic Earth. Turkey is constantly being shaken by earthquakes. One of the most deadly was the bombing in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time more than 17,000 people died.
Researchers fear an earthquake of 7.1 to 7.4 might threaten. But when it comes to the earthquake, it is unclear. When the earthquake hit the west of the country and Istanbul again on Thursday.
Firms design Emergency plans, so-called Go-Bags have been packed with everything needed to be ready next door, and schools will help children to cope when the earth wakes up. When the next big storm comes, be unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people were injured. Some buildings had suffered slight damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imagoglu persecuted the developments of the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Centre (Akom). According to which two mosques collapsed in the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer.
Warning against inheritances in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users report panic. Buildings woke up. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Phone lines were interrupted. It has been tougher than Tuesday, a user writes. The head of the Turkish Red Half Moon, Kerem Clinic, warned by Twitter before neighboring. He urged people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
The time of the strike is given according to official data at 13.59 a.m. (place time). Only a few minutes after the first attack, according to CNN Turkey, there was a succession, which was given with a magnitude of 4.0 on the judge scale.
Only on Tuesday had an earthquake of strength 4.6 has shaken the Turkish Marmara region - it was to be felt until Istanbul. Also its epicenter has been located in the Marmara Sea west of the millions of metropolis, the disaster protection authority Afad told on Tuesday.
It wasn't the only earthquake that made it possible to strike this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a serious earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later a catastrophic earthquake could occur in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will ever recover - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy estimates that the Earthquake is now a warning. It has become more likely, he said to CNN Turk. "These could be signs of a larger earthquake," said Ersoy to the sender. "Before or after the great earthquake will also come".
A few weeks ago there was an incident - the earthquake also triggered major concerns in Istanbul. In Albania there was also a severe earthquake only a few days ago - there were 68 injured. This year at the bottom of the lake there was also the earthquake.
Parliament: New flammable substance in Ukraine
Two outstanding documents provide for new firearms in Ukraine's affairs for possible abuse of power by President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible settlement procedure, US democrats are strengthened: The complaints made by an anonymous notifier about Trump and his controversial phone call with the Ukrainian President raise important points for investigations against the president. Trump himself sees himself once more as a victim of a "Hexenjagd". He also doubted the credibility of the Whistleblower.
United States: United Airlines Flights Locked in Toilet - Directed Flights
Because a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a flight of United Airlines was redirected. The WC door was blocked during the 1554 flight from Washington to San Francisco, according to US media.
In an out-of-plan interim landing on Wednesday afternoon (local time) in Denver, the woman was finally able to be released from the narrow cabin. About an hour after she had been locked in there, US media wrote on a call to other passengers. For further flight towards San Francisco, the passengers had to change the machine.
In an online video that is supposed to come from Flight 1554 according to US media, it is to see how several people try to free the woman. "We are working at the moment to open the door, Ma'am. We will get you out soon, okay?" says one man. The airline apologized to all the passengers.
The Kakkerlake: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all the Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unrecognizable.
Ian McEwan (71) was inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The Change" written a book about Brexit Chaos in Britain.
The novel "Die Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will appear in German on November 27th, the Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) told. This is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his earlier life, but now on one occasion is the most powerful man in Britain. He sees it as his mission to implement the will of the people in fact and is determined to leave nothing and no one to stop.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "If the Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, if the minister is lying shamelessly like once the Soviet leader, when Brexitiers in high positions are just overcoming the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer has to ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer: write." McEwan was only published in the spring of the novel "Machine like me" about artificial intelligence.
Kafkas, published for the first time in 1915, is a story about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "as an unlucky figure", is excluded from family and society after all, and finally goes to the ground. "Ian McEwan refuses to describe a world that is the head," said the Diogenes publisher.
EU invests €9.5 million in Austrian railway infrastructure
11200 wagons in Austria and Hungary get flex brakes to reduce noise load by freight trains. In addition, sections of the train connections between Graz and Gyor and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are modernised and electrified.
This is expected to make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions, according to EU authorities.
Thomas Cook: All travel until October 31st
The German travel agent Thomas Cook cancelled all travel until 31 October 2019 one day after his application for insolvency. Travel could not be "for insolvency reasons", the company announced on Thursday night.
The bookings of the Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Travel, ÖGER TOURS, Booker Travel and Air Marine that have already been paid or paid in full were also affected. As it is about travel starting on November 1, 2019, the company opened. In agreement with the insolvency insurance, the other procedures were examined, it was said.
Thomas Cook, in Germany, was involved in the sog of the British mother group and had applied for insolvency on Wednesday. The company, including Neckermann travel, Öger Tours and Bucher travel, employs about 2,000 people in Germany.
Insurance wants to transfer money back to hotels immediately
On the other hand, from this Friday hotels abroad, which are still hosting Thomas Cook holiday, will receive money from Zurich insurance. The payments to the hotels are linked to the condition that vacationers are no longer invited to extra payments.
On the basis of the booking information and without any separate invoices, hotels in the resorts should now receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich spokesperson of the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and subject to the fact that Thomas Cook travels from these hotels will not be required from now on for individual payment of hotel bills or otherwise," said speaker Bernd England.
The insurance responded to reports from hotel guests who were forced to pay for their accommodation on their own site. Some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had strongly criticized this.
As many hotels are affected, they will be matched with the insolvent travel provider on Friday, the insurance spokesperson said. According to Thursday, 70,000 Thomas Cook holiday holiday leavers from Germany were still on their way. Zurich Germany has assured the holiday and return of the Thomas Cook customers.
Insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the now announced payments to hotels by Zurich insurance only help travellers who are still on their way. For Thomas-Cook customers who want to fly only on holiday, it looks bad. On the late Thursday evening, the company announced that all travels would be cancelled until 31 October. This also applies to such bookings that have already been paid.
As it is about travel starting on November 1, 2019, the company opened. In agreement with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined, it was called. In principle, the insurance in Zurich is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travel is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurance company Zurich, which is represented by Kaera. Customers could be informed on the Kaera website about the possibilities of refunding the travel price and make their claims valid through a web form.
Prince Harry destroys explosives in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry has continued Lady Diana's commitment. In Africa he now changes directly on his mother's tracks.
The British Prince Harry has burned and destroyed a bomb mine in Angola with a blue protection vest.
Close to a British Halo Trust camp near Dirico, he set fire to a fire-circuit on Friday morning in front of ongoing TV cameras. In a safe distance, the explosives exploded in the savanna landscape without damage. Although the Halo Trust alone destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the bloody conflict in the African country for decades, there are still more than 1,000 mines that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his African journey, Harry wanted to walk directly into the city of Huambo on the tracks of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same bomb master who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to go back the way she was going at the time. The pictures on which Princess Diana went through a spacious mine field had gone around the world. She had also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day African trip since Monday, which began in the South African tourist metropolis Cape Town.
Standing Brexit negotiations: the danger of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly stated that he would not be guaranteed a third suspension of the Brexit negotiations. But what statements are already made in the polarising British era. The latest judgment of the Supreme Court in Great Britain floats like a Damocles sword over the Blondschop. His suspension of Parliament in order to be able to carry out its Brexit course until the date of departure was cancelled. And a bill passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to make an extension of the bilateral negotiations with the EU by 31 October. However, Johnson had categorically excluded again.
Boris Johnson still holds Deal for possible
However, the pressure does not seem to pass on to Johnson. Meanwhile, when visiting a hospital, he indicated that he supported an extension of the negotiations in the event of disagreement by the end of October:
You know, we're gonna stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by 31 October.
And best with a deal. I'm cautiously optimistic that this fits.
And the time is running slowly from Brexit negotiators in Brussels. About six weeks later, the EU and the British retailers have time to prevent a British withdrawal from the European Union without an agreement. However, the latest talks have not yet reached a breakthrough. An agreement until the end of October seems quite difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a new postponement of the date of exit is in force. The opposition does not trust the Prime Minister's words. She fears that Johnson could somehow implement the Brexit in the case of a no-deal.
US authority: Other deaths by e-cigarettes
The number of deaths associated with the use of e-cigarettes in the United States has increased to twelve. In addition, there are currently 805 confirmed and likely victims in this context, the U.S. Health Authority told CDC. According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, there were already more than 900 affected persons, about 500 confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. In Europe there is no similar increase in lung damage. The complaints seem to be limited to users in the United States.
Fear of new protests in Egypt grows
Millions of times the videos of Mohammed Ali have been shared in online networks. The builder and actor living in Spain is calling for a "People's Revolution". For today's Friday, he called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, whose critics are exposed to corruption and mismanagement. Ali is hoping for mass communications with a million participants in central places of the country.
The security authorities are alarmed anyway. In the centre of Cairo there was already an increased police presence. Several subway stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were blocked. In the past days, the police had strengthened their street controls and partially searched the phones of pedestrians for news and photos related to the protests.
On 20 September, the demonstrators gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend there were protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura with hundreds of participants. There was no such open protest in Egypt for years. According to the Human Rights Watch (HRW), the security forces responded. According to the Human Rights Watch (HRW), almost 2,000 people were arrested since last week. Many of them were arbitraryly arrested - only because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time", HRW informed the detainees, calling on lawyers.
The organization also criticised the censorship in the North African country. The government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The General has ruled the country since 2013 after defeating democratically elected Islamic President Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been arrested and partially sentenced in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs of Greenland expedition back
The polar researcher Arved Fuchs returned on Friday from his Greenland expedition. He was welcomed when he arrived at the port of Hamburg, among other things by the skipper Boris Herrmann, climate activist Greta Thunberg, who had brought the "Malicia" racecraft over the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists in recent months, Fuchs had examined and documented the effects of global warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland.
Fridays for the Future Movement were a blessing, said the Polar researcher. For years he waited for the young generation to register. For decades, it has been known that the earth is warming. However, many acted as if there was a planet B.
"What happens on the sea is often under public exclusion," Fuchs said. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the flooding of the seas. For example, during the expedition, they were measured with a terror of Greenlandic glaciers and were fished with nets for microplastics.
The Polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt, within the framework of the Hamburger Climate Week, was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award". "For all of us who have the survival of the oceans at heart, Arved Fuchs is a great example," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. "He is a witness to the changes that have been made in the Arctic in recent decades."
Dear Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid 430 Euros for noodles
430 Euro for two plate spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant not far from the Englishsburg in Rome: This seemed to be too much for two Japanese tourists. The bill included 80 Euro drink money, although they were paid by the two women, but they posted the Quitting on Facebook, which triggered hot reactions.
"These cases are damaging to the view of Rome. We call on the police to examine whether this is a fraud," asked a speaker from the Federationit, the Association of Travellers in Rome, according to the Roman daily newspaper Il Messengero (Friday Edition).
The Japanese women had ordered not only spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified themselves. However, this is not to be taken from the account. Also a drink fee of up to 20 percent of the account was normal, the host said.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? U.S. President Donald Trump could, after the turbulent revelations of the past days, actually be faced with an official settlement procedure, which the Democrats want to examine as soon as possible with their investigation in the House of Representatives - the talk is from weeks to a decision.
At the beginning of the scandal, the phone call with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj is likely to be made. The proposal of the Whistleblower, which has finally brought the debate on national security and democracy of the United States to the public, is monstrous: the President has misused the power of his office to instrumentalise the government of another country for an influence on the 2020 election.
The core of this project is also to be completed in the currently published co-writing of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not give rise to the full voice. The phone call of July 25 is only an episode of a much larger story, in which the centre next to Trump stands mainly his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
From the public's point of view, in May 2019, when the New York Times of Rudy Giuliani's travel plans reported to Ukraine, he wants to meet with the newly elected President Selensky, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are very strong. "We do not interfere in an election, we interfere in an investigation into what we have the right to," he says. He says the newspaper. He may think it is inappropriate, but "it is not illegal." Giuliani wants to be prosecuted in Ukraine for which there is hardly a basis - "because this information could be very, very helpful to my clients and be helpful to my government."
The lawyer and former New York's mayor seem to have been infected with right-wing fantasies that were fixed on Trump's opponent at the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time to construct a case for Russia's U.S. polls.
It is precisely the investigations that will be so prominent on the phone with Selensky in July. Giulianis and the president say: The former Vice-President and currently successful candidate for the presidential candidacy of the Democrats, Joe Biden, as Ukraine's representative of the Obama government, has been pressured to release the then Ukrainian Attorney General Viktor Schokin and to stop the investigation of the gas company he was responsible for, in which his son Hunter Biden was active. At senior times, Ukraine has been financially pressured to cover up the corrupt machinery of his family.
In fact, the process was different. When Joe Biden called on the Ukrainian Attorney General to go, the investigations against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden had never been directly affected. Shocking himself was subjected to a deeply corrupt offer, the U.S. government was far from the only Western partner who insisted on his release. Furthermore, the Obama government even explicitly supported investigations against the company.
Problems with Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disturbances with Instagram and Facebook. Thus, in particular, Germany, Great Britain and Spain are affected. On the website allestrungungen.de, users report that Facebook has not been calling again since around 3.30 p.m. Also Instagram reports that content could not be loaded. Also, whatsapp seems affected by the disturbance, although so far not in the same range.
Instagram and co. more frequently affected by disorders
It is not the first massive crash this year. Already in March and July, the services were out for several hours. And as in the previous cases, users also come back on Twitter especially this time to make their bad air.
Polish scientists saved in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists were rescued by the Chilean Air Force from the ice of the Antarctic. They were on their way with a hose boat and several miles away from their base when their engine failed. They had luck in the accident - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue screwdriver for the storage.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 we received the message, about ten minutes ago we started, and good 20 minutes later we were over the hose boat."
Poland has been operating on King George Island since 1977 the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station, 19 scientists working there. The frozen researchers have been safely brought back to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone NOT wireless charging
Practical but Harmful
Inductive technology through Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since recently several new smartphones have come to the market, which support wireless charging and sell themselves very well - in front of all the new iPhone-11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature sets battery
Researchers warn against wireless charging of smartphones. According to the University of Warwick's findings, this is extremely harmful for the devices. The reason for this is the significantly larger heat development. If you charge a normal mobile phone per cable, the battery will heat up to 27 degrees within three hours. In wireless charging, the researchers have measured over 30 degrees in perfect direction of the smartphone on the charging pad. If the mobile phone is something in addition to the spool, the temperature is even higher. In addition, the water volume of the charging pad also increases, which in turn drives the power consumption up.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature for battery durability is a decisive factor. Each degree plays a role. When charging with higher temperatures, the battery not only absorbs the capacity, but also does not last so long. So the lifetime of the battery is lower. Therefore, researchers recommend charging the smartphone by cable. Since a battery exchange is always connected to modern smartphones with high costs, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has recently increased the cost of an battery exchange even once more - and for all iPhones.
Practical
The technique is extremely convenient: Simply put the device on a suitable charging pad - these are now even installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without boring cable salad and exhaust fumes. Since Qi (stands for inductive energy transmission) has a worldwide standard, with the exception of Apple, there are few restrictions. However, according to researchers, technology should only be used in exceptional cases.
Everest Stau photographer: 13 thousand in six months
A Nepali mountain climber has, according to his own data, risen within just six months 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world. Nirmal Purja (36) reached the top of the Manaslu in Nepal and thus set a record, his expedition organizer shared with him.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 thousand in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has already made international battle lines: from him comes a photo of mountain climbers who stand on Mount Everest snakes.
The picture of the mass march triggered a debate on stronger security measures on the 8848 m high mountain and the highest peaks of the earth. Within a few days, 11 climbers died on the climb.
A problem for Purja could be the rise of the 14th thousand: now Chinese authorities are blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. The reason for this is, among other things, bad weather. At the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wants to talk to China to enable it to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was also a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman announced on Friday. "We suspect the elephants were poisoned."
The four Kadavars were found in a protected area near the famous and visited by many tourists before Mount Sigiriya. The animals were probably between 15 and 25 years of age, according to the police spokesperson. An autopsy was arranged to determine the cause of death.
On Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed each year. The perpetrators are often farmers who had previously been homeless in the country. At the same time, about 50 people are killed by elephants every year. This is usually the case when the animals go through villages built near their living space.
According to estimates, only about 7,000 elephants live in Sri Lanka. Their killing is theoretically subject to the death penalty.
British tanker in custody leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after its establishment by Iran. This was announced by the Bandar Abbas Maritime Office, according to the IRNA news agency. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had established the tanker flying the British flag on July 19th, under the pretext that the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf should have been ignored.
Management of Thomas Cook in Criticism
The competent Economic Committee of the Sub-House intends to investigate the Board of Directors Thomas Cook in a comprehensive manner. It is also intended to deal with the Board's salary packages as well as with the question why the British government did not want to make a financial contribution to the companies struggling for survival. "Our interest is in the company as well as in the control of external auditors," said the Committee Chairman, Rachel Reeves, in London. "We obviously have to do it with a bad example of management."
According to experts, genes are overestimated at the risk of bowel cancer
The role of genes in the family's increased risk of bowel cancer has thus far been overestimated. Researchers from the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg have concluded in a current study. Other risk factors such as family eating habits are therefore likely to be more difficult than previously. This has consequences for individual bowel cancer risk calculations, scientists stress.
Elon Musk lets Tesla shares increase
This was written by Musk on a Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrec" to Tesla employees. The demand is strong, so that Tesla can book 110,000 orders, it is further called Musks Newsletter.
The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to the market. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors felt the information: Tesla shares went with a plus of more than six percent of the trade. So strong the price has not been added for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered well 95,000 cars and thus achieved its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. Six-digit numbers have to be provided for this in the current and coming quarter. Above all, the most affordable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are few gains. Despite the boom, there has been a loss.
Will British government enforce Brexit law? Johnson withholding
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he is looking for an irregular Brexit after the possibility of circumvention of Parliament's last law, and on a corresponding question he said only on Friday in front of journalists, his government will remain in force.
The law provides that the government must apply for a postponement of the deadline, should not have reached an agreement with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitalisation law", which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
On Thursday, former British Prime Minister John Major expressed his suspicion that Johnson could try to use "political jokes" to enforce the law. Johnson could use a procedural strike that shifts the law to the time after the EU exit.
Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement."
Iran is likely to lead to high uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has raised pressure on the European Contracting Parties in the battle for the salvation of the historic nuclear agreement. "Unfortunately, the European states show inability or lack of readiness when it comes to concrete actions," Rohani said at a press conference at the UN plenary meeting in New York on Thursday. In case they do not live up to their promises, he took "further steps" away from the agreements of the difficult negotiated agreement of 2015.
The background is the conflict between the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which as a counterfactual commitment to normalise economic relations. The United States rose out of the agreement in 2018 alone to force Iran to move towards a change of course in the Middle East policy considered aggressive. President Donald Trump's government wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher mandates and is now re-approving severe sanctions against Tehran. Iran has recently responded to this with a re-enhancing of the uranium enrichment contained in the treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now also used or prepared for use with uranium installed at the beginning of September. According to IAEA, Iran is also preparing for the construction of more than 300 other centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are not ready to carry their share of the deal and therefore left the Iranians with the cost and burden of pressing US sanctions alone, Rohani said. However, there will be further talks that hopefully will resolve.
Rohani continues to fight Iran's development in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, following an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September: Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed on Monday the US estimate that Tehran is responsible for the attack. Initially, the Huthi rebels supported by Iran in Yemen were known for the attack, which was considered by the United States as a false confession. "We have nothing to do with this," Rohani confirmed on Wednesday.
"Those who raise such charges must provide evidence for this," said Rohani. "But the European leaders had not been able to do so in the talks with him during the UN General debate. Instead, they had only called on the rebels in Yemen to make such an attack. Rohani had met with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the past days.
Prior to possible talks with US President Trump, the extensive sanctions of the US administration had to be lifted first, Rohani asked. He urged the government in Washington to turn to a policy of "dialogue and reason".
Comet from other star crossed solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of the universe. This happened only once before. The comet allows for feedback on other solar systems.
What was at first just a suspicion is now confirmed: An interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depths of the universe was baptized on 2I/Borisov after its discoverer and has aroused the interest of astronomers all over the world.
On August 30, the extensive comet was discovered by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters in diameter. Observations from various observatories not only confirmed that it is an unknown comet, but also showed that it does not come from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object in 2017 after 1I/'Oumumamua, which was looked for during a passage of our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get insights into a foreign solar system before it disappears on a never-ending horizon. First observations show that the interstellar comet resembles our own system, as reported by the Astrophysic Institute of the Canary Islands. "The current speed of the comet is high, approximately 150,000 kilometers per hour, which in this distance is clearly above the typical speeds of objects surrounding the sun," said Davide Farnocchia from the U.S. Space Authority NASA in a statement.
The comet is according to the analyses on a so-called hyperbole track that leads it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reported. It is also responsible for the designation and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar star, which was first led under catalogue number C/2019 Q4, was given the name 2I/Borisov, which indicates that the first part of the name is that it is the second interstellar object that was discovered in our solar system.
Astronomers are happy: Unlike 1I/'Oumumamua 2I/Borisov was already on the scene. This leaves researchers many months to investigate. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium telescopes by April 2020," Farnocchia explained. "Then it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes by October 2020."
Several observatories have already taken the visitor into sight. Thus, a team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, which had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumumamua, determined in a first survey the diameter of the sky object at 2 to 16 kilometers. Recordings of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear wave of comet.
Researchers and researchers at the Astrophysics Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already won a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar swivel star, which offers a type of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object resembles such comets of our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar," said IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets could form in other solar systems through similar processes as in ours, added de Leon's colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of two equally interstellar visitors within just two years, according to the IAU estimate, indicates that these objects could open a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, as there are often such peak visits, it is still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly capture a planned satellite issue of the European Space Agency Esa.
By 2028, the agency will be stationing the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" (German for example comet catcher) at a waiting position in 1.5 million kilometres from the earth. According to Esa Scientific Director Günther Hasinger, it will be located either on a still unaffected, fresh comets from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor such as 1I/'Oumaumaa.
First landing on Beijing's new Mega-Airport Daxing
Just before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic, it is this: At the new Mega Airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first Chinese United Airlines passenger machine landed, a special honor for Captain and Crew.
By 2022, approximately 45 million passengers were to be completed annually at the new airport, then by 2025 it should already be 72 million. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion-dollar project. China's recent Prestige project is also called "Seasters" because of its six-armed building structure.
The complex has four starting and land tracks to be extended to seven later and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway transports passengers in just 20 minutes to the city centre of Beijing.
Even during the construction, the Chinese had been allowed to learn from Beijing several times. The opening of the main city airport in Germany since 2006 - and significantly smaller - was still being moved again. In Beijing, however, a first passenger machine had already landed after four years.
New overcrowded aircraft will fly 2030: in four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - from which the UK Space Agency is dreaming. It is possible to make this, for the 2030s mentioned overcast flight, a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre) developed by the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, the US channel CNN quoted the agency. "This is the technology that could definitely be realized," said Agent Graham Turnock to the transmitter. "We are talking about the 1930s for the start-up, and the work is already very advanced."
In order to advance the project, the British Space Agency wants to work closely with the Australian. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. As a single overcrowding vehicle for passenger transport, the Concorde had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 to 2003 and used three to three and a half hours for this purpose. In 2000 an accident occurred at the start of a Concorde at Charles de Gaulle Airport, where all 109 Instances died. Last year, the U.S. aircraft builder Lockheed Martin Plane announced, together with the U.S. Space Authority Nasa, a overcrowding aircraft, the "X-Plane", which also has such development in Virginia Galactic.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," writes Reaction Engines, among other things, on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - which means five times as fast as the sound. Furthermore, such aircraft are also usable outside the Earth's atmosphere and thus enable the "next generation of truly reusable frame travel devices".
Rise in Washington: Trump wants to track anonymous tippers in Ukraine's affairs
In Ukraine's case of possible abuse of power by the U.S. president, Donald Trump wants to detect possible hiding places in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the Whistleblower the information," Trump said on Thursday before US personnel from the United Nations in New York. The person concerned was almost "a spy" and with such things in the past was "a bit different" than today.
This was assessed as an insulting attempt against the tipper. Actually, the event was not public. However, on Friday, several U.S. media distributed audio media from the audience. Democrats responded to the President's statement.
The Democrats in the U.S. representative's house had announced preparations for an official anti-Trup procedure on Tuesday. Their proposals were based primarily on the written complaints of an anonymous secret service employee, who raised heavy charges against Trump and his government headquarters. On Thursday, the authors' descriptions were made public at great public pressure.
As part of his work, the Whistleblower will have received information from several government employees, according to which the US President "uses the power of his office", to achieve that another country is interfering to his favour in the US 2020 election.
At the centre of the project is a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selensky at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his colleagues to investigate which might harm his political rival Joe Biden. This is about earlier transactions by Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his blast from Ukrainian justice. Biden is in the race for the democratic presidential candidate for the 2020 election.
The Whistleblower accused the White House with a view to Ukraine's telephone also of the cover: leading government employees had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the cover. As usual, an electronic vocabulary protocol was produced. This was after the discussion on the instructions of lawyers from the White House but was removed from a database that was usually intended for this purpose and was stored instead in a specially protected system. To date, only a large conversation protocol has been published.
The identity of the referee is not publicly known. The "New York Times" reported that it was supposed to be an employee of the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
Trump once again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of Tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, "the so-called Whistleblower" has disseminated information from a second hand, which had been exposed as inappropriate.
As Trump spoke in New York about those who were supposed to have played the Whistleblower information, however, triggered excitement. The president of the U.S. representative house, Nancy Pelosi, responded anxiously and complained that Trump's statement once again undermined the integrity of the government.
A number of investigations have been carried out in the House of Representatives in various committees against Trump and its environment for months. In view of the proposals made by Ukraine, the Democrats are now undertaking investigations with renewed interest in order to initiate a possible anti-thromp recruitment procedure.
"The Whistleblower has given us a driving plan for our investigation," said the head of the Secret Service Committee in the House of Representatives, Adam Ship. Trump attacked the ship sharply, threw him a false representation of the things and again demanded the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly rebuked the ship and had already demanded its withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government officials from the security and foreign policy field, mostly under democratic but also under republican presidents, made themselves known in a statement published on Friday after the investigation initiated by the Democrats for a possible settlement procedure.
For the next procedure, there is no precise timetable. With the majority of them in the House, the Democrats could try a so-called impeachment procedure. However, the decision on a real post was taken in the Senate, where Trump Republicans have the majority. The prospects for such a procedure are therefore limited. So far, no US President has been elected by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
VW Board of Directors: jobs are being reduced to "like"
The plans of the VW brand, in which production will continue to reduce costs, could go to the burden of manufacturing in Germany and Europe. This concern is driving the company council of the autobuilder. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs from ten billion euros to two billion euros by 2023. Of these, 500 million euros should be saved this year.
A key to this is staff costs. The "future pact" negotiated between the company and the board of directors in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. In principle: A job can only be built down by auto-construction if it is almost proved that the related activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment insurance is applicable until 2029.
As our newspaper has now experienced from operating councils, however, jobs in production, which are not actually available, will be "like" on a different path - i.e. over the official course. This would often not be reoccupied by free regular jobs.
In these cases, the Board of Directors has no possibility of forcing the reinstatement. Meanwhile, there is a shortage of staff in many places, which assumes that the concerns about the gradual outflow of vehicles would be greater. In order to increase the fear that vehicle production could be withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is more favourable in other parts of the world. From VW it was just said: "A change in employment volume is taking place as agreed socially compatible along the demographic curve".
The VW brand wants to further standardise production worldwide and manage new projects centrally. This should also reduce costs and speed up decisions - the aim behind is to increase productivity and thus increase competitiveness. Production Board Andreas Tostmann said at a conference of managers in Berlin: "Just in uncertain times from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the US and China we are well advised to make ourselves a Christian party".
On this path there is already success: For example, this year since 2013, for example, the cost of production would be reduced per vehicle compared to the previous year. Tostmann said before journalists that the production time for golf 8 to be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg would be reduced by 1.1 hours. Exact figures for the duration of production do not mention VW, according to our newspaper, it will be around 7 at Golf.
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg family plant is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The works of Braunschweig and Salzgitter are made components. For Wolfsburg, VW-internal applies the Faust rule that 800,000 cars must be built there annually, so that the work is profitable. In 2018, however, the discharge in Wolfsburg was limited to about 700,000 vehicles - due to the decreasing demand for diesel and the problems of converting to the new WLTP consumption and exhaust test procedure.
As Tostmann's Production Board announced last year, however, in Wolfsburg, a "perspective" car should roll a million cars from the band. This should enable the bonding of golf production in the trunk - because the Zwickau plant, through the conversion to the location for the E-Auto production, provides the golf production.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are being produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have declined recently. Therefore, the expectations are now resting on Golf 8. In spite of all efforts to build the E-Mobility, the Wolfsburger’s Bread and Butter Car will remain first.
voodoo forced to prostitution: human traffickers convicted
Young women from Nigeria are covered with swearing, locked up and forced to prostitution. Six alleged human traffickers have to go to prison for this.
Six alleged human traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced on Friday to prison sentences of up to eight years and three months in Bochum. The defendants had locked young women from Nigeria into the asylum area and forced them into prostitution. In order to force their obedience, they still had to pay a ritual vow in their home in front of a voodoo priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years of age. They were brought by Libyan lockers in canoes across the Mediterranean. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. In Germany, they were distributed to various brothels to cover the alleged lock costs of an average of EUR 25 000. The wages were therefore fully cut.
The accused - four men and two women - had admitted the inclusion and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerians on board. "The work made it difficult for the women physically and mentally," said Judge Isabel Hoffmann at the hearing. "Some were rightly accused."
The judgments are based on the involvement of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, accessory and heavy forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIM Permanent dispute with the Lufthansa Group has again threatened Ufo with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union "will inform on 14 October of the work combat measures in the LH Group", informed Ufo-tariff board Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and her daughter Eurowings have been refusing to negotiate with the Ufo tariff negotiations for months. This is also the question of whether the trade union has legally announced tariff agreements with Lufthansa.
In this point, Ufo is now strengthened after a decision by the Labour Court of Frankfurt. Lufthansa wanted to find that the tariff contracts were not cancelled. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and checked to bring the case against it. "That a second court sees the matter completely different, I consider it unlikely," said Ufo-Principal Flohr.
In August Lufthansa had also submitted an application to the National Labour Court for a judicial review of the status of the Ufo as a trade union. The company argued that the trade union had not used a representative board for months and was thus unable to fulfil its role as a tariff partner.
Previously, there was a fierce leadership dispute in the Spartan trade union, in which many members of the board as well as the Advisory Board have resigned, including the long-standing trade union chief Nicole Baublies. The Ufo had, due to the doubts about its leadership, put forward an already launched U.S. vote on the strike of the cabin staff at Eurowings at the end of July.
Easier entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
So far Saudi Arabia has not just been known as an international tourist magnet, but this should change now. The country at the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia is going to attract more international tourists in the future. By 2030, the tourism commission was going to increase the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia for international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said the President of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia is still difficult to access for tourists. Visawerden usually only for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with family members in the desert state. With the new rules, the erzconservative Kingdom expects more revenue from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riad wants to reduce its dependence on oil trading.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the largest oil refinery in the country in Akkaik and the Churais oil field. As a result, the national oil production broke down dramatically, the oil prices rose. It would take several weeks for the oil production of the Kingdom to reach its old level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber stick in preparations for wedding party
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) prepared for her wedding party. The model posted on Thursday (placetime) in their Instagram stories several party photos on which she is to be seen in the white wedding look. Reality Star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had, according to the People magazine, organized a youth community meeting in Los Angeles.
Justin posted several colored, including banana-printed extracts on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me to choose my tuxedo for the wedding". According to media reports, the Promi couple wants to marry church at the next weekend.
The Biebers gave the word yes a year ago in a New York Station. There was no greater party at the time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently explained that the two had found a common level after initial problems: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship".
Two deaths from plane crash in Czech Republic
Two people died in the crash of a small plane in western Czech Republic. The wreck was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Metschin), the police reported. In the case of the dead it was a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday evening after the crew had given an emergency signal via GPS. The search also included a military helicopter in use. The accident source still needs to be identified. It is about 30 km south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 km north-east of Regensburg.
Half of European tree species are threatened by extinction
In addition to the pests, there were also diseases, foreign species, non-sustainable logging and the growth of cities causes the threat, the World Conservation Union IUCN reported in Brussels on Friday. It has investigated the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of these are not found on any other continent. Of these 265 are threatened 58 percent. 66 are already at the highest level of danger and thus are facing extinction.
The IUCN divides endangered species into six categories: "potentially endangered" over "dangered", "strongly endangered", "threated from extinction" and "dead from nature" to "dead". Overall, it lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants as being at risk worldwide.
Hebrew and Wild Russkastanie Threatened
In Germany, in particular, Ebereschen (Sorbus) was threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, of the German Press Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are so small or by the transformation or weakening of their living spaces."
It also looks bad for the wild ordinary Roscastanians. They have been considered as "dangerous" since 2017, stage two of the IUCN scale. The largest threat is the Balkan minimote in addition to a mushroom. It has spread throughout the continent since the 1980s of Southeast Europe and has hardly natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild Roscastanians (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe on less than 10,000 copies. Not taken into account in this assessment are the trees in cities, parks and lonely.
Straucharten and Moose are also in danger
At the same time, IUCN scientists have created new European Red Lists for Soft Animals, Strawberries and Moose. More than one-fifth of soft animals and Moose and almost half of all straw charts have been threatened, says IUCN. This lies mainly in the destruction of the wild, integrated species, agricultural practices and climate change. Soft animals such as snakes played a key role in recycling nutrients in the soil and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation for many overlooked and underestimated species is precarious, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Bureau. "We must limit the impact of man on our ecosystems and make them a priority."
Earthquakes in front of Istanbul: 34 Reported victims
In the recent earthquake in Turkey, 34 people were injured. Death was not reported. Thousands of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
Thus hundreds of buildings were damaged. Since the earthquake on the eve of the day, there have been nearly 200 disasters. The earthquake of the strength of 5.8 on Thursday had shaken the Marmara region before Istanbul and triggered panic in the million metropolis.
Now the government wants to set up a Commission to prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
Istanbul is considered particularly at risk of an earthquake. Under the Marmara Sea is a section of the so-called North Anatolic Disorder, which marks the boundary between the Eurasian and the Anatolic Earth.
One of the most severe seizures was one of the strength 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then located in Golcük south-east Istanbul. More than 17,000 people died.
Already on Tuesday, an attack of strength 4.6 had shaken the region around Istanbul. The authorities called on the residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira are taking part in the half-time show
The Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira are taking the half-time show of the next American football final Super Bowl. This was announced by the singers on Twitter. "It won't be bigger," Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She was madly excited to stand on the Super Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020, it will be so far in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez explained that she had dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - at that time she saw Diana Ross flying at the half-time show in heaven. "Now it's even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I'm going to perform with another Latina." She could hardly expect "to show what we girls can do on the world's largest stage".
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she felt honored to be in addition to another artist on one of the largest stage in the world and to represent Latinos and Latinas from the United States and the whole world. "And then on my birthday!" the main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter, except for the first time that the two "Kings" stand together on a stage.
Shakira comes from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents come from Puerto Rico.
Fighting downwards
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most popular TV broadcasts in the United States. Even though you have recently reduced viewer numbers: In February the show in the United States attracted the smallest viewers for more than ten years. Nevertheless, there were still nearly one hundred million people on average.
About the half-time show of the last Super Bowl there was a stir in the foreground: In the fight about dealing with quarterback Colin Kaepernick last February media reports like Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to appear. Finally, the Pop Group Maroon 5 led the half-time show - the critics were not friendly.
Kaepernick, then a quarterback of San Francisco 49ers, was on his knees during the 2016/17 NFL games in the National Anthem of Protests against Police Violence and Rassism. With his protest, Kaepernick set out a movement, many players took over the gesture. This caused great excitement, US President Donald Trump attacked the most African American football stars sharply. Kaepernick himself has been involved since March 2017 and has no NFL party any more. He proposes to reject the association for political reasons.
Cook-Pleite: Hotels get money from insurance
Some banks were expected to be expensive at the expense of the travel provider Thomas Cook, according to a press report. There are threats of high write-offs on outstanding loans and loans. Credit Suisse is also affected, writes the "Financial Times" in its issue of Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse should have made a total subscription of up to 1.8 billion UK pounds (about 2 billion euros) on their books, according to the report.
The creditors of loans were required to purchase deposits of between 900 million and 1 billion pounds and the lenders between 550 and 825 million pounds. The amounts actually to be written should be at the top of the band, an expert said to the sheet.
The extent to which the losses of the creditors will be real will be demonstrated after the insolvency proceedings have been completed. A person who is close to this procedure has not been too hopeful. For example, the approximately 40 planes of Thomas Cook in Great Britain are "old" and many of the properties are in bad positions. Most money can be recovered from the sale of the airport slots as well as the Thomas Cook brand, it was said.
Rackets are supposed to have brought alleged killers to Italy
The Sea Watch Captain Carola Rockete may have brought men to Italy who were supposed to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot exclude this, but we do not even have secure information," said the spokesperson of the Refugee Organization Sea Watch, Ruben Neubuilder, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants would have recognized the three men in Italy. You are asked to rape, torture and kill people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators were arrested in the detention camp in the Italian Messina. New builders stressed that the refugee organisations could not verify who they were on their ships. "They come without passports."
Carola Rackete had illegally brought migrants to the port of Lampedusa on June 29th and was taking over a ship of the Italian financial police. On the day the three suspects were also to arrive there. Against the captain, investigations are under way for aid to illegal immigration.
USA warns federal government in front of Huawei
The head of the U.S. Internet Office Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the Federal Government to trust the Chinese network equipment Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too high," Pai said to the "trade sheet" with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law", which each company "under Chinese law" has a duty to follow instructions from the security authorities.
The applicable law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests," the FCC Chief continues. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
In the meantime, the Federal Government has agreed to demand a "declaration of trust" from suppliers.
Berlin wants to first try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "Trade Sheet" using its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology does not consist only of hardware:
Just the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time," Pai said.
It is "very difficult to imagine", that a government authority, "no matter where it would be able to check each update in real-time to detect security risks", the FCC chief continues.
To the Chinese Group Huawei he proposes close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The relationship of ownership is opaque. The employee company, allegedly belonging to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai said to the "Trade Sheet".
The United States presents findings that government employees are placed within the company. Pai was recently for talks in Berlin to advertise for the position of the United States.
Chemical plant burned in northern France: schools closed
In the night, residents hear explosions. A giant fire wall illuminates the sky over a North French chemical plant. The fire is destroyed after hours - but cleaning work could take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and children's cracks in the region remain closed.
In 12 municipalities, the facilities would not be opened on Friday, the competent prefecture was informed. The Ministry of the Interior had asked the citizens to stay in buildings as far as possible and not quit smoking. There were no casualties. Farmers and growers were called to bring their animals inside, to protect their feed and to stop the harvest first.
The fire could be completely wiped out on Thursday evening, as the Prefecture reported. There is still the risk that after the eradication of smell, the Prefecture would spread on Twitter. According to the Prefecture, 240 firemen and 90 policemen and gendarmes were in use at Brandort.
From the chemical factory a giant black smoke column was previously raised. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the factory of Lubrizol, the oil supplement. The production plant is a few kilometres away from the city center.
The plant in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of hazardous sites which are particularly monitored. In the Italian Seveso near Milan, a devastating chemical accident occurred in 1976.
The prefect of the region Normandie, Pierre-André Durand, told the broadcaster BFMTV that there had been no "high toxicity" in samples at first. However, a pollution of its nearby areas could not be excluded. In the river the dams were built against pollution, the prefect explained.
The fire broke out early in the morning at 02.40, the authorities reported. The cause was initially unclear. Rouen is a regional metropolis and is located at the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Minister for Finance: "Germany must invest now"
French Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to invest more to stimulate economic growth in the euro area.
Germany needs to invest, and now the sooner the better," Le Maire said on Thursday evening in the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The euro area economy is weakening, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation worsens in order to make the necessary decisions".
For example, Le Maire said that it should take action on those countries that have more investment in the budget.
France did not have these slots, added the minister and referred to his country's high state debt. This is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. The French state debt had to be "stabilised" and "deprived", said Le Maire.
France has repeatedly appealed to Germany in recent years to make more public investment to revive the European economy, whereas German politicians have repeatedly called on France to overcome its budget deficit.
The French budget presented on Thursday for 2020 provides tax reliefs of more than nine billion euros for households.
Thus, the French government reacts, among other things, to the protests of the yellow-western movement. The new debt is to be reduced to 2.2 per cent, as expected by 3.1 per cent this year.
Is he still trying to cheat?: Johnson raises a question about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticises the "Capitulation Act" adopted by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law presupposes the British prime minister to avoid a chaos brexit, but critics fear that Boris Johnson could use another loophole. However, on this possibility, the Tory politician refrains.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he wants to implement an irregular Brexit - despite the legislation last passed by Parliament, which should prevent this from happening.
The law provides that the government must apply for a postponement of the deadline, should not reach an agreement with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitalisation law", which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
On Thursday, former British Prime Minister John Major expressed his suspicion that Johnson could try to use "political Shikane" to enforce the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedure which shifts the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exit. Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident that the EU will leave on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement".
Johnson's Chief Adviser Dominic Cummings, meanwhile, explained that he felt the political controversy about Brexit as "walking in the park" and expressed confidence that the EU's intended exit would still come: "We will enjoy what we will win, we will withdraw (e.g. Red.: from the EU), no concern," said Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph" in a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit "Vote Leave" campaign during the 2016 EU referendum, now acts as the leading strategy in the British government headquarters of Downing Street. He is going to be behind the uncompromising policy that has led the prime minister to a far-reaching situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of Linda McCartney's camera, which has become one of the big rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (bags) dives deep into the entire private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married from 1969 to Linda's death in 1998, was apparently proud and touched when he presented the film band "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Among the illustrative guests were Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison, and Pretenders-Frontwoman Chrisie Hynde.
After the launch of the event, McCartney wrote at Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a volatile view of the life of an exceptional family from the time before Instagram, a celebration of the authority of LindaMcCartney as an engaged artist and the instant magic of the Polaroid film".
At Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found it in photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of Polaroids have made it, some hundreds of it are now published in The Polaroid Diaries for the first time.
There are portraits, silences, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," writes art critic Ekow Eshun in his introduction. And of course there is always one in the middle again: your husband Paul - as you may never have seen him.
There he dances with his daughter Mary on the shoulders, calls in the bathroom with a baby on his head, or wears undeformed moonboots. Certainly, the McCartneys were an exceptional family, but outside the fireworks light on her farm in southern England or Scotland also led a very normal life. According to BBC, Mary McCartney said that she had slept as a baby in a bed that her father had built from old potato boxes. And it has not always been cleaned up at McCartneys.
Like hardly any other medium, the Polaraid camera starts at the moment. Linda McCartney's recordings are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than pure snapshots.
It's about the decisive click: you have to recognize when a great photo happens before you. And then you have to cut it at the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you cut it two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it may be a completely different photo." And Linda would have had the gift, always to catch the right moment. "She just knew she had it," said Paul in Eshun-Esay.
There the light, the composition, the image cut and the colors, which make "The Polaroid Diaries" not only a entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but in addition to all the anecdotics there is also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes also act as abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the newly posted Beatles album "Abbey Road", which appeared 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
In spite of the US sanctions imposed on Iran, Turkey continues to import oil and gas from the neighbouring country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not cancel the oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our gas from there," Erdogan said in New York, where he had participated in the UN plenary.
Erdogan, however, admitted that Turkey had problems importing Iranian oil since some companies had "retired because of the US threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey "will continue our relations with Iran especially on this and many other issues", said the Turkish President, who had repeatedly criticised US sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since their departure from the international nuclear agreement with Iran, the United States has pursued a policy of "maximum pressure" against the Islamic Republic. According to the United States, Iran has secretly pursued an nuclear programme and has not adhered to the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. In recent months tensions in the Gulf region have increased significantly.
U.S. government wants to restrict the admission of refugees
The U.S. government wants to severely restrict the admission of refugees. On Thursday, the U.S. Foreign Ministry declared that the annual ceiling for a new resettlement programme should be reduced from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees. This corresponds to an average of 40 percent.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the United States would continue to be committed to supporting refugees. However, the most important task is to protect and serve US citizens.
In the future, the US government will focus on the admission of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are thus in danger, as shown by the statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On the other hand, there will be a maximum of 1500 refugees from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
In the 1980 programme, refugees from UN camps are selected from all over the world and re-occupied in the United States. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 financial year would be the lowest in the programme's history. Already the current ceiling of 30,000 is a low value. When US President Donald Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, left the White House, the figure was almost 85,000.
Relief organizations responded to the announced reduction of the upper limit. "It is a very sad day for America," said the head of the International Rescue Committee David Miliband. The United States would continue to damage its leadership role in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump is trying to limit immigration to the United States - legally as illegal - strictly. The US government expects to receive 350,000 asylum applications for the coming financial year. These numbers are separated from the new settlement programme.
Donald Trump - "Comes to a Hospital"
US President Donald Trump has visited the Whistleblower business in the espionage. Whoever has given him any information that has been misusing his power has changed accordingly, "comes close to a point," said Trump, according to a private event on Thursday in New York. This reports several US media accordingly.
When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial developments in the White House, Trump said, "This is coming close to a summit." Trump then added, "Do you know what we did in ancient times when we were beaten? Right. The spies and traitors, we were doing something different than we are now doing."
Observers evaluated the latest observation on a possible approach to the death penalty. The democrats made sharp criticism of Trump’s statements and challenged him with intimidation of witnesses. It was also an attempt to prevent a congressional investigation into a possible settlement procedure against him, the chairman of the Committees for Foreign Affairs, Secret Services and Supervision in the House of Representatives wrote.
The Whistleblower is proposing to the President in a complaint now published to have abused his office to request a merger of another country into the U.S. 2020 election. In particular, his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian colleague, Vladimir Selenskyj, was launched in summer: In the interview, Trump approached him to investigate his potential democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump contests any misbehaviour.
It is still unclear who the Whistleblower themselves and its informants are. However, as reported by the New York Times, the Whistleblower should be an analyst at the CIA's foreign intelligence service.
Refugee boat known: baby and baby drowning in Egäis
People are always trying to get over the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. Often the boats are too small. When a boat goes down, seven migrants are killed, including five children.
Before the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants were killed by the sinking of a canoe. Among the victims were a baby and four other children, the Greek Coast Guard reported. Four children, three women and five men could thus be saved from the river from the occupation of a passing ferry.
Among the victims was also supposed to be a locker, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had broken up from Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group Inouses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inouses lies between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently moving to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly in many small boats. Last year, 174 people died on this route, according to the United Nations Refugee Relief Agency (UNHCR).
The Who Breaks Concert
A U.S. concert of the Rockband The Who found a happy ending because of the incompetence of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the show at Wednesday evening (location time) in Houston, his voice gave up the service. At the eighth song, Daltrey told the audience: "I think I should leave it as long as it is still going".
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend asked for an apology and added that Daltrey could "not speak right now". The audience promised Townsend to come to his expense at a recovery concert. But a date is not yet fixed.
For Friday in Dallas and Sunday performances planned in Denver, The Who said they should be picked up at a later time. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old band colleague Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Rental suddenly set: WeWork lets you sitter real estate markets
In New York, WeWork has risen to the largest office meter.
Within a few years, WeWork rises from the small start-up to the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in crisis. Owners have to fear for billions of revenues.
The crisis of office tenant WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance on the world's largest real estate markets. The company had set up founder Adam Neumann as chief a few days ago, moved the planned stock exchange and started selling subsidiaries and values such as the private jet for executives to win financial slots for the coming weeks and months. Among other things, WeWork reports on the British "Financial Times", WeWork has stopped the completion of new registrations with immediate effect. Thus, among other things, in New York and London, the largest office tenants are suddenly off the market.
WeWork rents large offices in the long term and rents them in short-term in part small units to members. This can be individual volunteers, small startups or entire departments of large groups. WeWork is currently burning money with this business at a staggering rate. In the past year, the company entered a loss of $1.6 billion, with sales of $1.8 billion. This year alone the rental costs should be increased by hiring new large areas at an estimated $2.5 billion. In order to reduce the loss, the new company management should now have withdrawn the emergency brake and the lease of new areas with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded lease contracts with periods of up to 15 years, from which commitments of more than 40 billion dollars are due. These huge liabilities could not only become a problem for the company itself and its investors, but also for all real estate markets.
Estimates of the economist Dan Alpert from the Cornell Law School in New York rented WeWork in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the last 24 months almost 300,000 square metres office space. Only WeWorks New Contracts made sure that the demand for offices in New York was larger than the new ones that came into the market at the time. Without WeWorks expansion, the office gap in the US metropolis would have increased at that time, as Alpert wrote in the "Business Insider". Similarly, in London, where WeWork currently operates several dozen offices in a better position.
Even in the UK capital, the balance on the real estate market could be felt without any further expansion of the aggressive start-up. Among other things, WeWork is the main tenant, in a recently purchased office in the center of the financial metropolis for almost EUR 100 million purchased by the savings provider Deca.
Many owners have converted their properties for WeWork's requirements with high investment. WeWork to make its business model profitable soon, the real estate owners had to write off a portion of the expected billions of revenues. Access to WeWork's reserves - however few - did not have any reservations despite the long-term leases. Because the rental of WeWork's individual locations is usually carried out by extra-founded subsidiaries, so-called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company only holds a narrow limit.
Russia has again caught numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In the past days, 262 other wilders who had illegally fished in the waters have been arrested, according to the Agency Interfax, the Russian Home Secretary's FSB told them on Friday.
Only ten days ago 161 North Korean fishermen were arrested. Previously, the border guards were shot and three of them were injured. This time there were no casualties, it was called. North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were thus on their way to Russian high seas. There the Russian Coast Guard is carrying patrols according to their own data to protect their multi-biological resources. During the re-checks, 30,000 ink fish were discovered. In addition, the data were seized after three fishing and two motorboats and brought to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok. According to the agency, the Coast Guard 2018 detected more than 8,000 violations.
According to local entrepreneurs, the Russian Fisheries Authority did not issue any fishing licences to the North Koreans today. Thousands of North Korean fishermen have already been arrested there for the time being, according to 2019.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the remote Primorje region, Georgi Martynow, recently complained about also high environmental damage by North Korean fishermen. They fished narrow synthetic nets forbidden in Russia. These would also fetch small creatures from the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be removed in the sea where they needed 200 years to be installed. Also, the ships themselves do not comply with the hygiene and technical regulations.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured during the arrests during the week. A injured North Korean also died as a result of his injuries to the FSB. On 17 September, Russian border guards first set up a North Korean boat and then a second after that fire had opened.
US ban on entry against former President Castro
The United States has imposed bans on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children. The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs founded this in a statement on Thursday with Castro's involvement in "grave human rights violations". As the head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean, he introduced a system in which thousands of Cubans would be arbitrarily detained and there were more than 100 political prisoners.
As Chairman of the Armed Forces, Fidel Castro, the brother of the late revolutionary leader, was also guilty of human rights violations. "The violation of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime is responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," said US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo.
President Donald Trump had pronounced a ban on entry on Wednesday, among others against members of the Venezuelan government and the military. For months in Venezuela, a bitter struggle has been waged between the government and the opposition. The United States has imposed a series of sanctions against Maduros government to force him into the knees and to help the opposition leader and self-appointed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered one of the closest allies of Maduros. The socialist Caribbean peninsula receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of doctors sent. After the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous secret service agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress government opponents.
New climate protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to go back to the streets today for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate week, the Fridays for Future movement plans again actions and broadcasts in dozens of countries around the world. New Zealand and Australia were allowed to start before protesting across Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a major event in Canada’s Montreal. Also before the White House in Washington, demonstrators wanted to gather.
The size of the worldwide demand this Friday will be after record participation of the week is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. "The last Friday has reached over four million people for the climate. This Friday we will do it again!" she wrote on Twitter. So far it has given 6383 actions in 170 countries, she added.
A good third of all the world's demonstrators - around 1.4 million - had participated in the protests in 575 German cities according to Fridays for Future. This time, according to the movement, there are plans for broadcasts in at least 65 cities. Among them in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to go to the streets for climate.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had sat in front of the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 to encourage the politicians of his country to make greater use of climate protection. The Fridays-for-future movement had recently been created. In particular, students and students participate in the climate protests, but more and more scientists and other adults.
Together, they call for more ambition from politics in the fight against global warming and the threat of climate catastrophe. In particular, under the Paris climate agreement, global warming had to be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees in comparison to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg arrived just a month ago after a two-week transatlantic tour with a high-sea snowflake in New York. She had recently participated in United Nations climate protests and summits. On Monday she gave an emotional talk to the United Nations in which she spoke to the heads of state and government of the earth. In her home Stockholm she was invited on Wednesday for her use of the alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livehood Foundation for Climate Protection.
Russia bans smoking on the balcony
People in Russia will not be allowed to smoke again on the balcony in the future. This is a change in fire protection. "This is also true for smoking," said a spokesperson from the Ministry of Emergency on Thursday in Moscow of the agency Tass. The ban should enter into force on 1 October.
Anyone who smokes, however, has to count on a fine of 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If the cigarette should fire, then the penalty will fall higher. Under the ban there are also candles burning according to the Ministry. Also, grilling meat on the balcony is not allowed.
Attack against cybercriminals - resolve server
In the fight against Internet crime, German investigators have for the first time raised a large server provider for illegal business in the darknet.
A total of 13 offenders are suspected of having hosted numerous websites at the Mosel in an ex-Nato-Bunker in Traben-Trabach, via the internationally active criminals operating their machinery.
This was reported by the General Public Prosecutor in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday night for a large operation. The darknet is a protected part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects were supposed to have been, among other things, the operators of the world's second-largest darknet market for drugs, Wall Street Market - the investigators had destroyed it in the spring. The attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was also controlled by a server in cyberbunker, according to the Attorney General's Office.
A host of this kind has been removed in Germany for the first time. A webhost provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
During the access operation with the support of special units such as the GSG9, there have been searches in Germany and neighbouring countries. They have been the result of almost five years of research. In the afternoon, the investigators want to know more about the details.
New global climate protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests, thousands of people want to go back to the streets today for more climate protection.
To complete an international climate week, the Fridays for Future movement is once again taking place in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a major announcement in the Canadian Montreal.
Climate protests who are actually Thunberg's rearmen?
Justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm up the climate. So much more amazing that a 16-year-old girl computationally keeps the people of power in front of her nose. But what lies behind it? Is it willingness to help or smart marketing a climate activist? Historical mastering or manipulative tactics want for himself?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg puts the masses in motion and brings young people up for a better climate-friendly world. It is historically not the first time in Europe that a young man creates a collection of children and young people to win for himself. Already in 1212 a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt selected to take part in a fairer world. At that time he also has a lot of young people to win for himself and this convinces him to cross the sea in order to get to the popular country, just like Greta Thunberg recently made his trip to America with a sailing boat.
But there is a shadow page about this? Why does it need a share named "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR manager on her side. In addition, her mother has published a book that has sold itself widely, thanks to the daughter in the disaster light. Also, the old-fashioned Follower of Greta Thunberg were a little upset about the last PR show, or the trip with the boat was probably too thick for some successors. This is also not unfounded, because the action came into the media very well for use and it flows a lot of money thanks to the impressive action.
Here the spirits now separate themselves: Is it morally right to be financially enriched when saving the world? Is it still authentic if certain groups of people are working together with stockbrokers during the world's rescue action? No matter which position is finally referred to, a critical and reflective point of view is increasingly important in a democratically defined society, because democracy lives by different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense to ask even seemingly shaped projects of certain trends.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crossed by our solar system
A foreign comet crosses our solar system at the moment.
The suspicions of astronomers have confirmed: A foreign comet crosses our solar system at the moment - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - Long the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have confidence: A comet crossed by another star at the moment of our solar system. He was baptized after his discoverer 2I/Borisov and employs astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers on the Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissow on the Crimea. He looked with a self-built telescope across the sky and further observations confirmed his first suspicion. In fact, it is an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. He is only the second of his kind that was seen in the flight.
The great chance for astronomers is now to have insights into a strange solar system. Apparently, the comet resembles those of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysic Institute of the Canary Islands. The comet is, according to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), a clearly interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbole that leads it out of our system.
Comet has already been looked for - and can be observed for several months
But before it is so far, astronomers can observe it closely. Unlike his predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in his approach, which means that he can be examined for months from Earth. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium telescopes by April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia from the U.S. Space Agency NASA. "Then it will only be observed with larger professional telescopes until October 2020."
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First knowledge about Comet 2I/Borisov wake up hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometres in diameter. At the same time, the celestial bodies seem to be similar to our comets - because, as the IAC researcher Julia de León expresses it, the spectrum of the swivel star is similar to ours. This observation draws close to the fact that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in ours, added de Leon's colleague Javier Licandro.
But the observation goes beyond individual knowledge. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within just two years allows, under circumstances, a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids are always busy again. Only recently did a giant asteroid come across the earth and came close to it dangerously.
"Absolutely imperceptible": Rachel Johnson dissipates about brothers
Just leaving his younger brother's cabinet, now his sister speaks clearly the prime minister's war language as "tasteless." It's not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "Treaty", "Treaty": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to work on - at least verbally. During the Question Hour in the Under-House this Wednesday, it was on the massive impetus of the opposition, and in the meantime other critics have reported themselves to be: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told the sender Sky News that her brother used words such as capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU exit should be "hanged, dragged, trimmed, trimmed and feded". She considered this to be highly reprehensible. She did not recognize her brother's version again," said Rachel Johnsons, who had participated in the EU parliament elections for the Anti-Brexit Party "Change UK".
In particular, she said that her brother Jo Cox mentioned an EU-friendly deputy under house, who had been murdered a few days before the 2016 exit referendum by a Neonazi. Their memories could be most honored by passing through the Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the basement. "It is very unsatisfied to refer to an MP who was killed by someone who called the 'British first'," Johnson's sister now criticized.
Cox's widow also criticized the Prime Minister sharply. "It makes me sick when Jos Name is used this way," he tweeted. "The best way to honor her is if you are passionately and determined to do so, where you believe - no matter what view you are. But you should never "demonize the other side". He also complained that an atmosphere had been created, the attacks had become more likely.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson, younger brother Jo, had laid his office as Secretary of State and his mandate as Tory's deputy. "I had broken up between loyalty to the family and the national interest in the past months - it is an insurmountable tension," Jo Johnson founded the move.
Johnson's language was also strongly criticized in the Church. As the "Times" reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England are criticising the language which is "not worthy of this country". In a joint statement they declared: "In the past days, the language, both in debates and outside Parliament, has not been acceptable. We should speak with respect to each other."
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez perform at the Super Bowl
In the year of its 100th anniversary, the NFL has a strong sign: two women with Latino roots appear in the semi-time show of the upcoming Super Bowl. They promise "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina-power at the Super Bowl: The Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the semi-time show at the upcoming final of the U.S. Football League NFL.
"I feel incredibly honored and humiliated to represent the Latino community in addition to JLO, because it has an incredible strength in the USA," Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, takes place in Miami on 2 February. In the metropolis at the southern tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is a Puerto Rican origin.
"I love that the Super Bowl this time puts two women on stage - and two Latinas," said Lopez. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. It promises for the show "an explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York, after her parents had emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she ended up with songs such as "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and has been seen in the drama "Hostlers" in the German cinemas since November.
Shakira was known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer. She created her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Whereever".
The announcement of half-time guests is expected in the United States every time with tension. This year many value the selection as also political gestures. Finally, the country, not least through the immigration policy of President Donald Trump, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the largest US sports event and at the same time a giant advertising show. Artists such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones were there for furore. Usually watching at the NFL final is over 100 million TV viewers, it is also popular in Germany.
Last year there was political controversy. The reason was the dispute about the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to rise from a protest against police violence against blacks, while playing the national anthem, and for that, among other things, had been dealt with by President Donald Trump. Out of solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had refused a super-bowl performance - including Rihanna and Pink. That the rock group Maroon 5 was finally criticized by many.
An actor and YouTube adds Egyptian ruler: But first, Mohammed Ali stays abroad.
The two men, who influenced the flow of blood back to the streets of Egypt, had spent the past week both abroad. One of the two swooped back on Friday at Cairo Airport. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. In a week, in which Egypt's former Muslim Brother Mohammed Mursi, the first freely elected head of state, had retired, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had committed suicide against political Islam and no silver was lost over human rights violations at the Nile - in a week, in which Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people because they had dared to protest against the presidents in New York.
This is what the president of the other man is trying to do on the streets. Mohamed Ali, of course, remained abroad, where he refrained from the access of the security forces who would arrest him immediately when he tried to enter Egyptian soil. Last week, the 45-year-old actor was known only as an Egyptian minority. Today, he is the leading voice that dominates the political discourse in the country’s cafes, living rooms and test rooms: With his YouTube channel "Mohamed’s Secrets" Ali calls his countrymen to rise against Sisi.
He goes directly to the head of state and in a completely rustic language. While the people are hungry, the president is suffocating in luxury, and let himself build beautiful new palaces, it is called there. The army leadership on which Sisi is based his rule throws forward Ali corruption and eviction. Because he has been working in his second business as a construction contractor for 15 years with precisely these gentlemen's business, he seems quite to know what he is talking about - at least the impression of many Egyptians, as the numbers are showing.
The first time last week, after Sisis Griff had demonstrated thousands against his rule and almost 2000 citizens, including prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for a "million march" for this Friday. The fact that so many people would be on the streets was unlikely. But there were several smaller protests, for example in Giseh at Cairo and in China at Luxor. Videos in social media showed protests that Al-Sisi demanded corruption and its departure. In these protests the police also launched tear gas and rubber shots. These videos were not allowed to be independently verified by the police.
From the city of Mansura in Nildelta, where demonstrators marched banners last week with the president's portrait in pieces, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the escape streets. In Cairo several subway stations in the city were closed for "maintenance work", most of the streets around the Tahrir Square, the heart of the revolution of 2011 were blocked. And at the Rabaa Square, where supporters of the defeated Muslim brother Mursi were shot down in 2013 until the army killed them under fire and up to 800 people, another measure should prevent them from gathering unsatisfied: Sisis wanted to make a big deal for the president here.
Mohamed Ali called these measures a change in his tactics: "Our goal must not be the Tahrir Square," said Ali in his video camera in Barcelona. "Don't let us meet with police officers." As a retreater, however, this is not to be understood: "The whole of Egypt is the Tahrir Square".
When the provider promises too much power
If the Internet connection seems to be much slower than the provider has been claimed, there are various test options.
Whoever concludes an internet contract doesn't need to be blind to the speed data of the providers. Customers can check for themselves in case of accidents how much of it is actually achieved.
Finally, the promised transfer rates are part of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, the Consumer Central Bayern states.
If the connection appears to be much slower than the supplier has been claimed, there are various test options. Thus, the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed upon in the contract.
"However, the tests of the suppliers are carried out according to specific requirements and are therefore not uniform and objectively calculated," the Consumer Central Bayern suggests on their side.
If the connection is significantly slower than announced, customers may set an appropriate time limit of usually 14 days to produce the promised performance.
If this does not work after repeated requests, customers can cancel and, under circumstances, also claim damages. However, in the case of continued success, only the way of complaint will help.
First-class Republican for Investigation
As first-class Republican, the Governor of Vermont has expressed himself for an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where it comes from here is determined by the facts that will be established," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affair before taking action - an impeachment procedure can lead to the President's resignation.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to investigate the intervention of the democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
Republikans have so far abstained from criticism of Trump due to the Whistleblower affair; few of them are unhappy about this. Scott’s statements are a first sign of this in Trump’s party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already turned against Trump’s policy several times, such as against the lockdown of environmental protection regulations and the strengthening of immigration rules.
Spider-Man remains in the MCU: Further Marvel film planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August it was known that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would thus no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was completely unclear how it should go with the movies around Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man gets another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) according to "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home". This reports several U.S. media consistently. As a result, the movie is scheduled to start: The movie is scheduled to start in the United States as of July 16, 2021.
The magazine "Screenrant" quoted Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige as saying: "I am glad that Speedey's path is being carried on in the MCU. I and everyone at the Marvel studios are most pleased that we can continue to work on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes, as Sony continues to work on his Speedey verse. We never know what the future will bring".
But how does it come to the sudden good news? Apparently Sony Marvel has submitted an offer. According to industry magazines, the Disney Group, which also belongs to Marvel, would participate with 30 percent in the revenues of coming Spider-Man films. However, the message is not confirmed.
This is how Duke Meghan and Prince Harry show up at the "Suits" final
After nine stacks, the series "Suites" in the United States has now arrived at the big finale. In the final result, there were many happy endings and also many Cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Megan (38), who had been involved in the series for many years, were charmed with Tribute. Attention, the following sections contain Spoiler to the finale.
One way forward: Herzogin Meghan did not return in the final for a final farewell as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some of her views once again showed the most memorable scenes with today’s Duke. For example, the moments of the failed and happy wedding with Mike or how she greeted him after his abandoned prison sentence.
But also her true husband, Prince Harry, was occasionally mentioned in the "Suites" final, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) just marches towards the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a very promising remark about his attraction. Whether he has actually cast himself a spell, the prodigal Harvey wants to know from the groom, just to notice snipically: "Louis, you are not the Prince of England."
Eggs: Baby and four other children drown at boat crash
At the centre of a refugee boat in the Aegean, a baby and four other children were drowned. In total, seven people died in the accident, as the Greek Coast Guard reported on Friday. The nationalities were still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inouses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently moving to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Assistance Agency (UNHCR) 174 people died. Federal Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced that both countries want to visit.
Together with his French colleague and the Commissioner responsible for the EU, he wants to inform Turkey about "the situation of refugees", said Seehofer on Friday. He then wants to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to be able to help with the management.
A spokesperson for the EU Commission confirmed on Friday the planned trip of Seahofers with EU Deputy Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, there are still unusual numbers of migrants from Turkey. On Tuesday alone 654 people moved to the Greek islands, it was called the Greek Civil Protection Ministry on Wednesday.
Does the Turkish deal still work?
The increased numbers have raised doubts as to the operation of the 2016 EU-Turkey Agreement, which provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants illegally crossing Turkey to the Greek islands. On the other hand, the EU wanted to take a Syrian refugee from Turkey for any Syrian displaced.
However, the processing of asylum applications is only difficult due to staff shortages on the Greek side. According to the Ministry of Civil Protection, Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos are suffering from almost 29 400 people. The worst is the situation on Lesbos: In a camp with capacity for 650 people, 5,200 migrants are currently in a camp.
Since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016, so many have been reported, the state radio reported.
Climate change: Heat leads to more heart attacks
According to doctors, climate change will be tested in the future. Climate change is "very safe" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society for Cardiology. Especially the heart circulation system made high temperatures and high temperature fluctuations in a short time and led to increased heart attacks. Especially people with heart circulation diseases, older people and diabetics were affected.
Green politician has to be responsible for a painful photo panel
The chief of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was manipulated for this reason by the cup?
The Canadian Green Chief holds a multi-way cup in his hand on a photo. But now he came out: the cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It is quite unmarked for a long time - and finally came to an end. Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens, has never been in the hands of the reused coffee cup. On the party's website she was able to see it on a photo with this cup, in a conversation with citizens. However, the photo was previously published and also distributed to the media - and there the cup was still a narrow (Papp) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green Chief must be responsible for the photo panel
The National Post then launched manipulation and that the party produced Fake News to appear more credible on the topic of "Environmental Protection" and that in the middle of a election to the sub-house, in which it is also increasingly difficult because of a scandal.
The photo went viral in the social media and started the discussion about Fake News. A user shares a opposite translation of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their presidents to hide their disposable cup".
May showed himself shocked and admired on her blog to have no knowledge of this action. To emphasize this, she posted the original: She, in conversation with citizens, a cup in hand. However, she put it right, be from Bamboo. She always had it. A speaker from the party said that it was just going to put the partyologo in the picture, and not to hide anything. From the photo is just one cut on the website.
May writes, it makes her sad for the employee who did that. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she says to the Guardian and at the same time tried something from her overcommitted team: "If they wanted to edit a picture again, then they couldn't do anything with my face, so I looked younger?"
The German Greens are also shot because of their use of disposable plastics or because of flights in Shitstorms - their pictures were not photographed, however. So the head of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, ate on holiday ice with plastic buckets, as Mercur.de* reported.
Influencerin wants free upgrade: life-long flight ban at Cathay
Apparently Jaqueline Ng has been guaranteed an upgrade by mail from Cathay Pacific. But when she asked for a check-in, she was not allowed on board - and she should never fly with Cathay again.
Spontan gets an upgrade for the business class - many of them dream of flying guests. Sometimes they are lucky, and the check-in employees offer a change from the economy class for free.
This case, however, shows how you should not do it: A self-declared influenzar has actively prayed for a free upgrade. On Instagram follow Jaqueline Ng more than 65,000 users. On 30 May she returned from Taiwan to New York and on 7 June.
On the trip, the Jaqueline employees refused an upgrade, although they had shown an email in which their Cathay Pacific allegedly presented an upgrade. The letter wants to have the influence of an airline marketing employee. On the other hand, the airline accused Jaqueline of falsifying the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline again tried to get an upgrade for the long distance flight. This time, however, the woman should have shown the same mail, with another reference number. The staff at JFK airport were skeptical: they had a problem at the center. And in fact, the employee from whom the mail is supposed to have interrupted the mail contact with Jaqueline. This also confirmed the mail system in which the messages did not appear.
The airlines canceled Jaqueline's ticket and suspended a life-long flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For $1,400 (about €1,180) she had to buy a new ticket to Taiwan.
In their case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company representing consumer interest, because Cathay had paid for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also claimed the costs for the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencer has cheated, it remains blocked for future flights. The operating conditions of the airline also state that it does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to please - and now activates a lawyer.
Oil prices according to the report on ceasefire in Yemen
The oil prices fell by more than a dollar in the shortest time on Friday afternoon. Recently, a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea class Brent 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4 percent less than in the day. The price for a barrel of the American West Texas Intermediate (WTI) species fell by 1.3 percent to $55.77.
The trigger for the course course was a report by the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia is supposed to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had resulted in five percent of global oil production in mid-September. Huthi rebels in Yemen associated with Iran had announced the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia is responsible for Iran like the US government. A ceasefire would intensify the political tension in the region.
If an agreement is actually possible, you can focus on growth and demand, said Ole Hansen, Head of the Department of Nuclear Strategy at the Saxo Bank of the News Agency Bloomberg.
The oil price continues to move downwards in the past few days. A week ago a barrel of WTI oil had cost up to almost 59 dollars, Brent almost 65 dollars.
Bloomberg had recently reported, calling on Insider, that repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia after the attack in mid-September was faster than expected. Consequently, the production volume has again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and is moving back towards the original quantity.
Recently, there were several press releases calling for insiders to report on the rapid progress of the state oil company Saudi Aramco in repair work. However, raw materials experts have pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently trying to avoid a traffic jam and negative impact lines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the establishment by Iran and the recently granted release on the way to leave the port. The crew is now preparing the departure, while the ship is still at anchor, Reedereief Erik Hånell told the Swedish radio on Friday morning in a text message.
However, the U.S. announced the transfer of defence rockets and soldiers to Saudi Arabia to Iran’s enemy. The fear of escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the U.S. and the United Kingdom had led oil prices to high levels in recent weeks.
Anti-thromp rejections sharpen
In the affair of possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, covert drafts against the White House were made. Several leading government officials had worked hard to prevent an access to the wording of the conversation after a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selensky at the end of July. This was explained by an anonymous notifier. The spokesperson of the representative house, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, explicitly urged the White House to "run". Trump spoke of a "Hexenjagd".
North Korea holds third summits of Trump and Kim
North Korea has doubted that in the nuclear dispute, there will soon be a third summit of power-holders Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. The sense and prospects of such a meeting were questionable due to the lack of progress in implementing agreements of the first summit in Singapore, top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said on Friday, according to KCNA.
The United States had not done anything to implement the decisions of the summit in the previous year, said the consultant of the North Korean Foreign Ministry. He also criticised tightened U.S. sanctions and the US and South Korea Joint Military Mandates. However, he hoped for a "wise" and "courageful" decision of Trump to bring it closer again.
Trump had said on Monday that he only wanted to know what a third summit with Kim would bring before he got ready to do so. Negotiations on a disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile programme have been on the ground since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in February in Hanoi. In June, both met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to revitalize the consultations, but without great success.
Prince Harry: Weapons manufacturers are supposed to help with mine clearance
The British Prince Harry has symbolically burned and destroyed a bomb in Angola. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the town of Dirico he set up the fire circle. In a safe distance, the bomber exploded. With a view to the goal of getting mine-free Angola by 2025, he later called out to all the countries whose names are on these weapons, but which have not helped the defences to commit themselves to help.
Pound under pressure - interest rate expected
British Pound under pressure
In view of an early rate of interest, the pound loses its value over the euro.
Frankfurt Speculations on an early interest rate of the Bank of England (BoE) add to the pound Sterling. The British currency agreed on Friday to up to 0.4 percent to $1.2269.
The originators of the sales were statements by notary banker Michael Saunders. This led to an interest reduction, even if a chaotic Brexit could be turned aside, as the insecurity would affect the British economy at a noticeable time. This statement was surprising, as Saunders was considered to be a proponent of a restrictive monetary policy, analyst Ricardo Evangelista from the Brokerhaus Activtrades said.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed to the pressures on the economy by the Brexit Hickhack without directly reporting an interest reduction. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wanted to lead his country, if necessary without a divorce agreement, to 31 October from the EU.
More: With his provocations the British Prime Minister took a high risk, but it could pay for him, says Commercial Editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Show more Russian manipulations
Material from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory is manipulated - this confirms David Howman, the sole director of the World Anti-Ping Agency (Wada) and today’s head of integrity of the Light Athletics World Association.
In January 2019 the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Antidiping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out that they were counterfeited.
In December 2014, systematic fraud was discovered in Russian sport. The Wada had blocked the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. After individual examination in the Summer Games 2016 in Rio, around 270 athletes from the country came under neutral flag, during the Winter Games in February 2018, 168 Russian athletes and athletes were at the start. Also in the World Cups in the various sports were allowed to be in the summer, even the football world with the host took place in Russia.
No positive results
In the following September, the Wada raised the Rusada band again, but called for access to the laboratory and the tested samples. The data should provide a conclusion on the extent of the cover-up of doping cases in the state doping. They should help to punish athletes and athletes subsequently. Three months later they were delivered.
However, the Chairman of the Independent Commission for Integrity (AIU) of the IAAF has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory has been manipulated. "Yes. We have received the data nine months ago. We should check that the Task Force has received the correct data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurt General Newspaper" on Friday. "We have identified many differences between the data that the Wada received from a whistleblower and those that they received from the Russians in January." Many positive findings were missing from McLaren's report.
Not affected by the WM
This confirms the position of the IAAF: The light athletics association maintains as the only organization on the Russian flag. At the WM in Doha, 30 Russian athletes started under neutral flag. They had to prove that they were training outside the Russian system and subject to testing.
By the beginning of this week, the Wada had already set up manipulations and called on Russia to respond to the rejections within three weeks. Russia is now threatening the new blockade of the Rusada and, in the worst case, the exclusion of the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.
