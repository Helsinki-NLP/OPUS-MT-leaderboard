Under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, the first economic reforms were carried out.
Since then, China's economic size has grown 90 times.
Last year, China for the first time drove more cars from Germany and passed the United States as the largest car market.
Up to 20 years of China’s GDP may be higher than that of the United States.
The rainstorm Daniel, the fourth known as the storm of the 2010 hurricane season in the Atlantic, was formed in the eastern Atlantic.
The storm, which took place about 3,000 miles [3,000 km] from Miami, Florida, has maximum constant winds of 40 miles per hour (64 km/h).
Scientists from the National Centre for Hurricane Victims predict that by Wednesday Daniel will become a Hurricane.
Since the storm is far from dry, it is still difficult to assess its potential impact on the Caribbean or the United States.

Because of the energy generated by the fusion of hydrogen atoms (or their fusion) to form heavier elements, stars emit light and heat.
Scientists are working to create a reactor that can produce energy in a similar way.
However, this is a very difficult task to solve and it will take many years before we see the construction of useful synthesis reactors.
The hard needle is held on the surface of the water due to the surface tension.
The reason for the surface tension is that the water molecules on the surface of the water are strongly attracted to each other more than to the air molecules above them.
The molecules of the water create invisible skin on its surface, allowing things like the needle to float upward.
The sharpness of the modern cane has a double edge with a depth in the middle. Both edges provide a better bonding of ice, even on a slope.
The edge, which is in contact with ice, also extends, as the bottom of the blade is slightly twisted until it turns to one side or the other.
This allows the skater to turn. If the balls turn to the left, the skater turns to the left, if the balls turn to the right, the skater turns to the right.
They need to get rid of the additional energy they get from the light to return to their previous energy level.
They do this by releasing small particles of light called "photons".
This process is called "stimulated radiation radiation," because atoms are stimulated by light, causing photons to be emitted, and light is kind of radiation.
The next image shows the emitting photons of atoms. In fact, of course, the photos are much smaller than those of the photo.
The photos are smaller than the matter that builds the atoms!
After hundreds of hours of work, the spiral in the crucible finally burns and it's gone.
You have to be careful when you change the electric screw.
First, the switch for the illuminating body or cable shall be switched off.
This is achieved because the electricity that flows into the contact where the metal part of the cube is located can cause a strong electrical impact. This can happen if you touch the inner part of the contact or the metal base of the cube while it is still partially in contact.
The main organ of the blood system is the heart that has the function of the blood pump.
Blood is removed from the heart by tubes called "arterials", and returned to the heart by tubes called "venous". The smallest tubes are called "capillaries".
Triceratopas was able to chew with his teeth not only the list, but also very hard branches and roots.
According to some scientists, triceratopes have eaten peanuts, which are a type of plant, often found during the crest period.
These plants are like miniature palm trees with crowns of sharp, budding leaves.
Triceratopasus may have used his healthy man to wrap the leaves before eating the stem.
There are also scientists who dispute that these plants are very toxic and it is unlikely that anyone who is a dinosaur would have eaten them, although in our day the lazy and other animals such as the parrot (the offspring of the dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
If you walk on his surface, you will weigh less than when you are on earth.
A man who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth will be about 36 pounds (16 kg) of Yo. Gravity, of course, will operate weaker.
Unlike Earth, the sun doesn't have a core that you can step on, it's all built of gas, fire and plasma.
The gas is evaporating from the center of the sun.
The outer part of the Sun, which we see when we see it, is called "photosphere" or "blue light".
The Italian astronomer Galileo Galileo used a telescope to observe that Venus had phases, just as the moon was about 3,000 years later, in 1610.
The phases take place because only the sun-turned side of Venus (or the moon) is lit. Venus' phases support Copernicus's theory that the planets are orbiting the Sun.
Then, a few years later, in 1639, English astronomer Jeremy Horox observed Venus' transit.
England is experiencing a long period of peace after Denlo's re-taking.

There's a lot of theories about how Sanskrit appeared.
Sanskrit is an ancient language and is comparable to the words in Europe Latin.
The earliest known book in the world is written in Sanskrit. After the compilation of the threatened Sanskrits simply fades because of the hierarchy.
As a source of European languages such as French and Spanish, Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language, served as a source of many modern Indian languages.
With the end of the battle for France, Germany is preparing to invade the British island.
The code name of the German attack is Operation Sillion. Most of the heavy weapons and ammunition of the British army were lost during its evacuation from Dunkerk, so the army was quite weak.
But the royal fleet was even stronger than the German fleet ("Kriegsmarine") and could destroy any modern ships sent by Lamansha.
However, very few of the Royal Navy ships were located near the likely routes for the siege, as the Admirals feared that they would be drowned by the German air raids.
Let's start with an explanation of Italy's plans, Italy was primarily Japan's little brother and Germany.
There was a weaker army and a weaker fleet, although four new ships had been built just before the war began.
Italy's main goals were the African countries, and in order to conquer these countries, they had to own a platform to allow troops to cross the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
So it was necessary to get them out of the British bases and ships in Egypt. In addition to these actions, the Italian warships had to do nothing else.
Like the United Kingdom, Japan was an island state.
The submarines are ships designed to travel underwater and remain there for a long period of time.
The submarines were used during World War I and World War II, when they were very slow and had a very limited shooting range.
At the beginning of the war they traveled mainly on the surface of the sea, but when the radar began to develop and become more accurate so as not to be noticed, the submarines were forced to swim under water.
German submarines are called submarines. Germans were very good at navigation and management of their submarines.
Because of the success of the Germans with the submarines, after the war, they have no confidence to have many of them.
Yes, King Tutankhamon, sometimes called King Tut or "Boy-King", is one of the most famous ancient Egyptian Pharaohs of today."
Interestingly, he was not considered to be very important in ancient times and was not included in most of the lists of ancient kings.
However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous. Although many tombs of the past have been robbed, it has remained almost intact.
Most of the objects buried with Tutancamon are well preserved, including thousands of artifacts made of precious metals and rare found stones.
The invention of bicycles with spears made the Assyrian chariots lighter, faster, and better prepared to run away from the soldiers and the others.
The arrows from their deadly arballets can test the defense of opponents. About 1000 B.C.E., the Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.
The cavalry is an army fighting on a horse. The Assyrian cavalry fought on the bare backs of its horses, as the saddle was not yet invented.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Omir - the legendary blind poet who created two masterpieces of Greek literature: the poems "Iliada" and "Odyssey", probably the most famous representative of this culture.
Sophocle and Aristotle are still popular dramatists, and their plays are considered one of the greatest works of the world’s literature.
Another well - known Greek is the mathematician Pythagorean, who is already known with his famous theory of the relationships between the sides of the rectangular triangles.
There are different estimates of how many people speak Hindi. It is believed that it is between the second and fourth most commonly used language in the world.
The number of speaking local languages varies depending on whether or not the dialects are very closely connected.
The approximate estimates range from 340 million to 500 million speakers and up to 800 million people can understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu are similar to dictionaries, but they are written differently; speakers in both languages can usually be understood in their daily conversations.
In the 15th century, Northern Estonia was under the strong cultural influence of Germany.
In their desire to draw close to God, some German monks invented Estonian.
It is based on the German alphabet by adding a letter ‘Õ/õ’.
Over time, many words borrowed from the German language have been downloaded.

Learning to create interactive media requires ordinary and traditional skills as well as tools learned in interactive classes (storyboard, audio and video editing, storytelling, etc.)
Interactive design requires that you reassess your perceptions of media production and learn to think nonlinear.
The interactive design requires the components of a project to connect with each other, but also to make sense as a separate unit.
The focal complexity and number of lens elements needed to reach a focal length range is much greater than normal lenses, and this is the lack of magnifying lenses.
This problem is getting smaller as lens manufacturers achieve higher standards in the production of lenses.
This has allowed the objectives of increasing the production of quality photographs, which is compared to that achieved with lenses with a fixed focus length.
Another deficiency in the booster lenses is that usually the maximum aperture (speed) of the lens is lower.
This makes cheap measuring lenses difficult to use without light at low light levels.
Among the most frequently encountered problems in attempting to convert a movie to DVD format is overscan.
Most TVs are made to please the general public.
That's why all you see on TV is with cut edges on top, down and off.
This is done to ensure that the image covers the entire screen. It is called an image that crosses the screen frame.
When you make the DVD, its ends, unfortunately, will probably be cut and if the video has subtitles too close to the bottom, they will not be shown completely.
The traditional medieval castle has long inspired the imagination, calling into the consciousness the images of the tournaments, the bells and the knightly spirit of King Arthur.
Although standing in the midst of thousands of ruins, it is not hard to hear the sounds and smell the smells of long past battles, to almost hear the rotting of garbage on the floor and to smell the fear rising from the underground waves.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why are the castles built at all? How are they designed and built?
The "Kerby McSlow" castle is typical of this period and looks more like a fortified house than a real castle.
The large glass windows and thin walls could not withstand a decisive attack for long.
In 1480, when Lord Hastings was involved in its construction, the country was relatively peaceful and needed protection only against small groups of hikers.
The balance of forces was a system in which European countries sought to maintain the national sovereignty of all European countries.
The concept is that all European nations must strive to prevent a nation from becoming strong and national governments often change their unions to maintain balance.
The first war, whose main issue was the balance of forces, was the war on Spanish heritage.
This is an important change, as the European forces no longer have the pretext of religious wars, so the Thirty Years War will be the last war, called "religious".
At a fire that was carried out by Herostrat on July 21, 356 B.C.E., the temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed.
According to history, his motivation was at any price to achieve glory. The rebellious Ephesians declared that the name of Herostrat had never been inscribed.
Greek historian Strabo later noted the name, and we know it today. The temple was destroyed the same night Alexander the Great was born.
As a king, Alexander proposed to take the cost of rebuilding the temple, but his proposal was rejected. Later, after Alexander died, the temple was rebuilt in 323 B.C.E.

The largest part of today's Pakistan and some regions in northwestern India and northeastern Afghanistan is the Indian valley civilization, which is a bronze civilization in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent.
Civilization flourished in the region of the Ind River, where its name originated.
Although some scientists speculate that since civilization existed in the already dried Sarasvati river basins, it must be called Ind-Sarasvati civilization, while some call it the Harapian civilization by the name of Harapa, the first of its objects that was dug out in 1920.
The development of medicine was assisted by the military character of the Roman Empire.
Emperor August began to call doctors and even formed the first Roman medical corpus to be used after the battles.
The surgeons knew various soothing, including morphine extracts from macaw seeds and copolymine from herbal seeds.
They gain considerable experience in amputations to save patients from gangrene, as well as the application of turnicates and arterial spatters to stop the blood flow.
Over the centuries, the Roman Empire has made tremendous progress in the field of medicine and has formed much of our knowledge today.

It can be personalized so that you can read easily, as well as with a lot or a little color, according to your wishes.
The attention deficit syndrome is a neurological syndrome with a classic defining triad of symptoms including impulse, tendency to scatter and hyperactivity or excessive energy.
This is not a difficulty in learning, but a learning disorder; it " affects 3 to 5 per cent of all children, perhaps up to 2 million American children".
Children with attention deficit syndrome (ADD) find it difficult to focus on schoolwork, but they can focus on things they like to do, play games or write sentences without punctuation, or watch their favorite animations.
These children tend to get confused in many trouble because they "have risky behavior, enter battles and seek authority" to stimulate their brains, as their brain cannot be stimulated by normal methods.
The lack of attention syndrome affects relationships with other adults, because other children cannot understand why they behave in this way, or why they drive in this way, or that their level of maturity is different.
Since the ability to acquire knowledge and learning has changed in the above way, the basic speed at which knowledge is acquired has also changed.
The approach to getting information was different. There is no longer any pressure within the individual cancellation, now the focus is on the possibility to cancel text.
Throughout the Renaissance, the approach to learning and dissemination of knowledge changes significantly.
Unlike other primates, hominids are already using their hands to carry weights, swinging trees and moving.
The hand and foot of the chimpanzee are similar in size and length, reflecting the use of the hand to carry the weight while walking with the wheel.
The man's hand has a more real fangs and is shorter than the foot.
Fossil bones at the hand of two to three million years of age reveal this change in the specialization of the hand from movement to treatment.
Some people believe that the frequent survival of very artificially challenged dreams can be very exhilarating.
The main reason for this phenomenon is the result of clear dreams that increase the time between fast-moving conditions of the eyes (REM).
With less REM at night, this condition in which you actually sleep and your body recovers, becomes too rare and becomes a problem.
It's just as boring as waking up every 20 or 30 minutes and watching TV.
The effect depends on how often in the night your brain tries to dream clearly.

Eighteen holes are played during a regular round, as players usually start from the first hole in the game and end at the eighteenth.
The player who takes the least hits or swings with the trigger to finish the track won.
The game is played on grass, and the grass next to the hole is hairy and is called green.
Probably the most frequently encountered type of tourism is the one that connects to travel by most people: recreational tourism.
When people go to a place that's very different from their normal everyday life to relax and have fun, we talk about it.
Beaches, theme parks and campsites are often the most visited places by holiday tourists.
If the purpose of visiting a particular place is to identify its history and culture, this kind of tourism is known as cultural tourism.
Tourists can consider different sights in the country or choose to focus only on one area.
Seeing this activity, the colonizers also called for support.
The troops strengthening the front positions included 1st and 3rd New Hampshire Colonels of 200 people under the command of Colonels James Reid and John Stark (both later become generals).
At the north end of the position of the Colonists, Stark's people took positions.
When the flood opened a cliff along the Mystic River river along the northeastern part of the peninsula, they quickly expanded the fence with a short stone wall to the north, ending at the edge of the small beach.

The atom can be seen as one of the main building parts of the entire matter.
This is a very complex unit that according to Bor's simple model consists of central core and orbiting electrons around it, something like planets around the sun - see Figure 1.1.
The nucleus consists of two types of particles – protons and neutrons.
The protons have a positive electrical charge until the neutrons have nothing.

Participants in regular activity needed more support for the negative perception of the pain, in order to reduce the chronic pain from feeling discomfort in the normal physical movement.
The vision or ability to see depends on the sensory organs of the visual system or eyes.
There are many different designs of the eyes with different complexity according to the requirements of the organism.
Different structures have different characteristics, are sensitive to different wavelengths and have different degrees of sharpness. They also require different processing to make sense of incoming data as well as different numbers to work optimally.
The collection of organisms of a particular species within a given geographical area is a population.
When all individuals in a given population are identical to a given phenotype, they are defined as monomorphic.
Individuals are polymorphic when they demonstrate several options of a given pattern.
The colonies of ants also march and nest in different stages.
In the nomadic phase, the ants march through the night and stop camping during the day.
After the food available is reduced, the colony approaches the nomad phase. In the course of this phase, the colony makes temporary nests that change every day.
Each of these nomadic rebellions or marches lasts for about 17 days.
The word cell comes from the Latin word "cella", which means "small room", and was originally created by a microscope that observed the structure of the cork.
The primary unit of all living creatures is the cell, and all organisms are made up of one or more cells.
Cells are so fundamental and important to life study that they are often defined as "the building elements of life".
The nervous system maintains the homeostasis by sending nerve impulses through the body to maintain a flow of blood and its indestructibility.
These nerve impulses can be sent so quickly into the entire body that they help to protect him from any potential threats.
The tornadoes defeat a small area compared to other angry storms, but they can destroy everything on their way.
Tornadoes root the trees, break down the boards of buildings, and lift cars high in the sky. The highest 2 percent of the tornado has lasted more than three hours.
These monster storms come with winds up to 480 km/h (133 m/sec; 300 miles/h).
For thousands of years, people have developed and used remedies to increase.
However, the first real telescopes in Europe were made in the late 16th century.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make distant objects look closer and bigger.
Hunger and selfishness will always accompany us and the nature of cooperation is that when the majority wins, in the short term there will always be something else to win if we act selfishly
Our hope is that most people will realize that the best long-term solution is to work on a team with others.
Many people dream of the day when people will be able to travel to another star and explore other worlds. Some people wonder what there is, others believe that aliens or other life can live on another planet.
But if this happens at all, it probably won't happen for a long time. There are trillions of miles between the stars that are "neighbors".
Perhaps one day your grandchildren will stand at the top of an alien world wondering about their ancient ancestors?
The bodies of the animals are made up of many cells, they eat different things and they have them in their stomach, most animals can move.
Only animals have a brain (although not all; bears, for example, do not have one).
Animals are found all over the earth, digging under the ground, swimming in the oceans and flying in the sky.
One cell is the smallest structurally and functionally attached to the living organism.
The cell comes from the Latin word cella, translated "small room".
If you look under a microscope, you will see that they consist of small squares or balls.
Robert Hook, a biologist from England, saw small squares in a cork with a microscope.
He was the first man to watch dead cells.
To move from one condition to another and not to change the elements and compounds.
The nitrogen in a gaseous state still has the same properties as the liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is more dense, but the molecules are the same.
Another example is the water. The water consists of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen.
Whether it is gas, liquid or solid, it has the same molecular structure.
Although his physical condition may undergo a change, the chemical remains unchanged.
Time is all around us and it touches everything we do, but it's hard to understand.
Time is studied by scientists in the fields of religion, philosophy, and science for thousands of years.
We are experiencing time as a series of events from the future to the present and then to the past.
Time is also how we compare the length (length) of events.
You can select the past time by observing recurring events. cyclically, this is what happens again and again at regular intervals.
In our time, computers are used to manipulate images and videos.
Complex animations can be created on computers, and this kind of animation is increasingly used in television and movies.
Often music is recorded with complex computers for processing and mixing sounds.
For a long time during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was believed that the first settlers of New Zealand were the Maori who hunted the giant birds called mine.
Then the theory assumes that the Maori migrated from Polynesia with a large fleet and took New Zealand from the sea, establishing a agricultural society.
But the new evidence suggests that Moriori were a group of Maori from the land, migrated from New Zealand to the islands of Chatham, developing their own recognizable, peaceful culture.
There was another tribe on the islands of Chatham — the Maori who migrated far from New Zealand.
They were called moriori, there were a couple of clues, and finally the moriori were destroyed.
People who have been participating for decades have helped us to evaluate our strengths and passions while at the same time openly evaluating our difficulties and even failures.
As we listened to people share their personal, family, and organizational stories, we gained valuable insight into the past and some of the personalities that influenced the culture of the organization for good or for bad.
Understanding history at least helps people get the idea of where they come from in the history of the organization, although it does not imply understanding culture.
Individuals and all participants discover the values, mission and driving forces of the organization by assessing the successes and realizing the failures.
In this case, what helped people to be open to new changes and new guidelines for the local church was the reminder of previous cases of entrepreneurial behaviour and success.
Similar examples of success have reduced fear of change, while at the same time creating positive tendencies for change in the future.
Convergence models of thinking are techniques to solve problems combining different ideas or areas to reach a solution.
The speed, logic and accuracy are the focus of this thinking, as well as the discovery of facts, the re-use of existing techniques, the collection of information.
The most important condition for this way of thinking is that only one answer is correct. It is only two answers, namely faithful or wrong.
This kind of thinking is associated with certain standard procedures or those in science.
People with such thinking have logical thinking, are able to easily remember models, solve tasks, and work on scientific tests.
Reading other people's thoughts is the most talented species in the world.
This means that we are able to successfully predict the perceptions of others, their intentions, beliefs, knowledge, or desires.
Understanding the intentions of others is crucial among these abilities. It allows us to resolve the possible uncertainties of physical actions.
If you see someone tearing a window on a car, for example, you'll probably think that he's trying to steal the car from an unknown person.
If he lost the keys to his car and tried to break his own car, he had to be tried differently.
YMR is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear-magnetic resonance, discovered in 1930 by Felix Block (Stanford University) and Edward Persel (Harvard University).
The magnetic field and the radio waves cause atoms to emit miniature radio signals in this resonance.
Raymond Damadian, a doctor and researcher, discovered in 1970 the basis for using magnetic-resonance images as a means of medical diagnosis.
Four years later, a patent was issued, which was the first world one convicted in the field of the YMR.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first YMR scanner "for the whole body", which he called "Nestom".
Asynchronous communication encourages you to set aside time for thought and provoke reaction to others.
This allows students to work at their own pace, as well as to control the rate of information.
In addition, there are fewer time limits with the possibility of flexible working hours. — Bremer, 1998.
By using the Internet and the global network, students have access to information at any time.
At any time of the day, students can ask questions to instructors and expect relatively quick answers instead of waiting for the next live meeting.
The post-modern approach to learning offers absolute freedom, there's no good way to learn.
In fact, there's not one good thing to learn.
Our current experience with all the training television broadcasts like "do your own thing" and presenting information, illustrates this.
Most of us watch television broadcasts that inform us about a process or experience in which we will never participate or apply this knowledge.
We'll never repair a car, make a fountain in our backyard, travel to Peru to look at ancient ruins or remodel the neighboring house.
Greenland is well connected to 93% of the population, which has Internet access, thanks to underwater optical cable connections with Europe and broadband satellite.
Your hotel or hosts (if you live in a guest house or a private home) will probably have WiFi or PC with internet connection, and all villages have internet coffee or some place with public WiFi.
As we said earlier, although the word "eskimos" remains acceptable in the United States, it is considered offensive by many northern nations outside the United States, especially in Canada.
Although you may hear the locals of Greenland use the word, foreigners must avoid doing so.
The locals of Greenland in Canada are called "inuit", while in Greenland they are called "kalalec" (multiple "kalalith"), or "Greenlander".
Crime and bad intentions toward foreigners are virtually unknown in Greenland. Even in cities there are no "dangerous places".
The cold weather may be the only real danger that the unprepared ones will face.
If you are going to Greenland during the cold season (be aware that the more north you are, the more cold), the more vital it is to wear enough warm clothing.
Many long days in the summer can lead to sleep problems and health problems associated with it.
In the summer, you'll also be the bait for the Scandinavian mosquitoes, although they don't carry diseases, they may be annoying.
And while San Francisco's economy is linked to the fact that it is a tourist attraction of the world class, this economy is diversified.
The main sectors of employment are professional services, government, finance, trade and tourism.
The frequent performance of the city in music, movies, literature and popular culture made it and its sights known all over the world.
San Francisco has developed a large tourist infrastructure with many hotels, restaurants and conventions of the highest class.
Also one of the best places in the country for another Asian cuisine - Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese - is San Francisco.
Traveling to Disneyland is a great worship for many American families.
The "Typical" visit includes flights to Orlando International Airport, bus trip to the hotel of Disney, for about a week without leaving the property of Disney and returning home.
There are endless variations possible, but that's what most people mean when they talk about going to Disney World.
Many of the tickets sold online via auction websites such as eBay or Craigslist are partially used multi-day parking tickets.
Although this is a very common practice, Disney prohibits it: tickets cannot be transferred.
Permission is required from the province for each campsite within the border of Grand Canyon.
In order to protect the canyon, authorisations are limited and can be obtained on the 1st number of the month, four months in advance.
This permit shall be granted on 1 January for each starting date in May.
Places for the most popular facilities, such as the campsite "Jark angels" near the ranch "Fantom", are usually exhausted after requests from the first day after opening the reservations.
There are a certain number of permits reserved for incoming applications that are given to the "first come, first served" principle.
Entering South Africa by car is an amazing way to get to know the beauty of the entire region as well as reach places that are away from the well-known tourist routes.
This can be done in a normal car with careful planning, but 4x4 is highly recommended and many locations are only available at a distance between the axles of the 4x4 wheel.
While you're planning, keep in mind that even if South Africa is stable, not all the neighbouring countries are.
Visa requirements and expenses vary from nation to nation and depend on the country you come from.
Each country also has its own laws on what emergency products should be in the car.
Victoria Falls is a city in the western part of Zimbabwe, which is very close to the border with Livingston, Zambia and nearby Botswana.
The city is located directly to the waterfalls that are the main attraction, but this popular tourist destination offers many opportunities for a longer stay for both tourists and adventurers.
During the rainy season (November to March) the volume of water will be greater and the falls will be much more impressive.
You'll certainly get tired if you cross the bridge or walk along the paths that are turning around the waterfall.
On the other hand, precisely because the volume of water is so large, your view of the actual Falls will be obscured by all this water!
The tomb of Tutancamon (KV62). KV62 may be the most famous of the tombs in the Valley, the site of the discovery in 1922 by Howard Carter of the almost unspoilt royal burial of the young king.
Compared to most royal tombs, however, Tutankhamon's tomb is hardly worth a visit, since it is much smaller and weakly decorated.
Anyone who wants to see evidence of the defeats on the mummy during the attempts to get it out of the ark will be disappointed, since only the head and shoulders are visible.
The treasures of the tomb were transferred to the Egyptian museum in Cairo.
Visitors with limited stay should spend their time somewhere else.
Pnom Add, 12 km southwest of Siem Rip. This temple was built in the late 9th century, during the reign of King Yasavarman.
The dark atmosphere of the temple and the view of Lake Tonle Sap make the climb of the hill seem to be worth it.
The visit of the facility can be easily combined with a boat walk to the lake.

Ecuador requires Cuban citizens to receive an invitation before entering Ecuador through international airports or border crossing points.
This letter must meet certain requirements and be legalised by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador.
These requirements are created by an organised migration flow between the two countries.
Cuban citizens who have a green card from the United States should visit Ecuador's consulate to get relief from this requirement.
You must have a passport valid for at least 6 months after the date of your trip. To prove the duration of your stay you need a two-way ticket.
The tours are more convenient for larger groups, so if you travel alone or with just one friend, try to meet other people and collect a group of four to six people for a better price of a person.
However, this should not be really out of your mind, because often tourists move around to fill the cars.
Actually, it seems more like a way to lie to people to think they have to pay more.
This steep mountain, often used as a background to many pictures of the ruins, rises above the northern edge of the Machu Picchu.
Most reasonable people should succeed in about 45 minutes, although it seems a little scary down and it is a tough and difficult climb.
The stone feet are located along most of the road, and the steepest sections are covered with steel cable parapets.
That's what I'm saying, wait until you're out of breath, and be careful in a tighter place, especially when it's wet, because it can get dangerous fast.
There's a small cave near the top that needs to pass through.
The objects and wild nature of the Galapagos Islands can be best seen with a boat, just as Charles Darwin did in 1835.
Over 60 cruise ships with capacity from 8 to 100 passengers are breaking the waters of Galapagos.
Most people reserve their place much earlier (as boats are usually full in the break of the season).
Make sure the agent you're using is a Galapagos specialist with good knowledge of different ships.
This will ensure that your specific interests and/or limitations are consistent with a ship that suits them most.
Before the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, northern Chile was under the control of the Inca, while the indigenous population of Araukans (Mapuche) lived in central and southern Chile.
Mapuches are also one of the latest independent American local groups that are not completely swallowed by Spanish government until Chile's independence.
Although Chile declared independence in 1810 (in the background of Napoleon’s wars, which leave Spain for several years without an active central government), a decisive victory over the Spanish was not achieved by 1818.
A Caribbean country that borrows the eastern half of the island of Spain, which shares with Haiti, is the Dominican Republic (in Spanish: Dominican Republic).

Usually it can be filled relatively easily, in case it ends. Furthermore, it gives a separator capability, approximately close to this DSLR.
Some medium-sized film cameras use negative 6 to 6 cm, more precisely 56 to 56 mm.
This gives the resolution almost four times that of 35 mm negative (3136 mm2 versus 864).
Among the most challenging reasons for the photographer is the wild nature and she needs a combination of happiness, patience, experience, and good equipment.
Wild nature is often taken for granted, but just as photography in principle, a picture is worth as many as a thousand words.
The photographing of wild animals often requires a long teleobjective, although for things like a flock of birds or some small creature other objects are needed.
Many exotic animals are difficult to find, and sometimes in parks there are rules for taking commercial pictures.
Wild animals may be shy or aggressive. The environment may be cold, hot or hostile in another way.

Because of the constant exposure of local microbes at home, it is very likely that you are already immunized against them.
But it is much more likely that you will face problems in other parts of the world where the bacteriological fauna is new to you.
Also, bacteria grow faster and survive longer outside the body at a warmer climate.
Which explains the attacks of Delhi Whitey, the Revenge of Montesuma, the Curse of Pharaoh and many of their friends.
As with breathing problems in the colder climate, stomach problems in the hot climate are often encountered and in most cases are obviously irritable, but not really dangerous.
If this is your first trip to a developing country – or in a new part of the world – do not underestimate the potential cultural shock that you can experience.

The residents of other areas often point to a favorable family environment as the main reason for their move there, and visitors often discover that the city is pleasant to visit with children.
Over the past 20 years, the number of easily understood children options in Uptown Charlotte has grown exponentially.
Taxis are usually not used by Charlotte families, although they can be beneficial under certain circumstances.
There is a surcharge for more than two passengers, so this option can prove more expensive than necessary.
Antarctica, which extends around the South Pole, is the coldest place on Earth.
Tourist visits are expensive, require good physical form, can only be carried out in the summer from November to February and to great extent are limited to the peninsula, the islands and the sea of Ross.
A few thousand servants live here in the summer in about fifty bases, mainly located in these areas; few of them remain in the winter.
The interior of Antarctica is a desert plate covered with ice thick 2 - 3 km.
Randomly specialized air travels go on land, for alpineism or for going to a pole on which there is a large base.
The trail (or highway) of the South Pole is a road from 1600 km from the McMerdo Station on the Ross Sea to the Pole.
This is a compact snow and the cracks are filled and marked with flags. The crossing is possible only with specialized tractors, drawing beams with fuel and supplies.
They're not very far-reaching, so the road travels long around the Transatlantic Mountains until it reaches the plateau.
The most common cause of incidents in winter is the slippery roads, the sidewalks and most of the steps.
At least you need shoes with suitable shoes. Summer shoes are usually a lot of ice and snow slippers, even some winter boots are inappropriate.
The material must be sufficiently soft at low temperatures and the shell shall be sufficiently deep, 5 mm (1/5 inches) or more.
Some boots have rods and have additional equipment with shingles for wearable conditions which is suitable for most shoes and shoes, for flows or the whole walkway.
The five must be low and wide. Sand, chalk or salt (calcium chloride) often spread on roads or roads for better sealing.
Lions are not anomalies; steep slopes can only hold a certain amount of snow and the excess volumes are drawn in the form of lions.
The problem is that the snow is sticky and some action will be necessary to get down and the snow drop may activate the rest of the events.
Sometimes the initial event, which acts as a trigger, is the solar warming of snow, sometimes additional snowfalls, sometimes other natural phenomena often caused by man.
The tornado is a rotating column of air with very low pressure that sucks the surrounding air inside and up.
They cause strong winds (often 100 to 200 miles/hour) that can lift heavy objects into the air and carry them in the direction of the tornado.
They are formed at first as fungi coming down from storm clouds, and when they touch the earth, they become "tornado".
Providers of virtual private networks (VPN) surrounded in an excellent way both political censorship and commercial IP geofiltering.
They exceed web proxy servers for several reasons: They redirect not only http but all Internet traffic.
They usually offer a wider frequency band and a better quality of service. They are encrypted and therefore it is harder to spy.
Media companies regularly lie about his purpose, claiming that it is "preventing piracy".
In fact, regional codes have absolutely no effect on illegal copying; a little bit of a copy of disk will reproduce well on any device where it is original.
The real goal is to give these companies more control over their markets; it is about money-revolving.
Since calls are redirected online, it is not necessary to use a telephone company where you live or travel.
Furthermore, it is not mandatory to get a local number from the community you live in; you can get a satellite internet connection in the wild nature of Chicon, Alaska, and choose a number according to which you are in the sun Arizona.
Often you need to buy a global number that allows PSTN phones to call you. For people who call you, it's important where the number comes from.
Text translation applications in real time – applications that can automatically translate from one language to another target text segments.
Some of the programs in this group can even translate texts in foreign languages on signs or other objects from the real world when the user directs the smartphone to them.
The machine translation is improved dramatically and now often gives more or less a faithful translation (and less stupidity), but must be careful as it is still possible that everything is wrong.
One of the most famous apps in this category is Google Translator, which allows to translate offline after downloading the desired language data.
Using GPS applications to navigate your smartphone can be the easiest and convenient way to navigate when you are out of your country.

If you have no connection to your phone data or are out of range, their work may be limited or not available.
Each quarterly store is filled with a confusing selection of prepaid phone cards that are suitable for use both from street phones and from regular phones.
Although most cards can be picked up anywhere, some specifically provide favourable tariffs for calls for specific groups of countries.
These services are often available through a free phone number with which most phones can be contacted free of charge.
The standard photo rules apply to video recordings, perhaps even more strictly.
Even if you're not allowed to take a picture of something, you shouldn't even think about recording a video.

Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have significantly expanded their services for flights to Africa. Compared to other European airlines, they offer competitive prices for links with many large African cities.
Since 2014, Turkish Airlines has been flying to 39 destinations in 30 African countries.
If you have additional travel time, check to see how the total price of your ticket to Africa is comparable to the price of a ticket to travel around the world.
For all these places outside Africa, do not forget to anticipate additional visa costs, departure fees, land transport, etc.
If you want to fly around the world just in the southern hemisphere, the choice of flights and destinations is limited, as there are no trans-ocean routes.
No airline union covers the intersection points of the three oceans in the Southern Hemisphere (SkyTeam does not cover any of the intersection points).
The Star Alliance, however, covers the entire area except the eastern part of the South Pacific - from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, where the LATAM Oneworld aircraft flies.
If you want to miss the South Pacific and the West Coast of South America, this flight is not the only option. (see below)
In 1994, the Armenian ethnic region of Nagorny Karabakh in Azerbaijan started a war on the lakes.

The variety of French languages spoken in Belgium and Switzerland is slightly different from the French language spoken in France, although they are sufficiently similar to each other in order to be understood.
In particular, the numbering system in French-speaking Belgium and Switzerland has some minor features different from French in France, and speaking some words is a little more special.
However, all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss people would have studied standard French at school, so they could understand you, even if you were using the standard French numbering system.
In many places around the world, the movement is a friendly gesture, meaning "hello."
In Malaysia, however, at least among the Malaysians in rural areas, this means 'come here', like a scroll to the body indicator, a gesture used in some Western countries, and which should be used only for this purpose.
In a similar way, a British tourist in Spain may confuse the removal with a hand for good-bye, including a hand turned to the swinging (and not to the face to which he leaves), as a gesture to return.
Auxiliary languages are artificial or designed languages designed to facilitate communication among peoples who would otherwise have difficulties with communication.
They are separate from the lingua franca - natural or organic languages, became for one reason or another a dominant means of communication between speaking other languages.
In the heat of the day, travelers can get chills with the illusion of water (or other things).
They can be dangerous if, by swallowing valuable energy and other water, the traveler is pursuing a migraine.
Even in the hottest deserts can become extremely cold at night. Hypothermia is a real danger if hot clothes are missing.
In the summer, you'll have to protect yourself from mosquitoes if you decide to walk out of the tropical woods.
A few seconds with open doors while entering the vehicle, the mosquitoes are sufficient to get into the vehicle with you, even driving through the subtropical rain forest.
Avian influenza can infect both birds and mammals.
People know less than a thousand cases, but some of them were fatal.
Most included people working with domestic birds, but there is also a small risk for bird observers.
The steep fiords and valleys, which suddenly fall to a high, more or less equal wage, are typical of Norway.
They often call these wages "vidde", which means a wide open space without trees, endless width.
They usually call them "hey" in Rogaland and Agder, which means woodless desert, often covered with pine.
The glaciers aren't stable, they're going down the mountain, which is where cracks, cracks that can be closed by snow bridges.
The roofs and walls of the ice caves can collapse and the cracks can be closed.
Huge blocks are loosened on the edge of the ice, falling and perhaps jumping or running away from the edge.
The tourist season for mountain stations is usually the most popular in Indian summer.
However, they have a different kind of beauty and charm during the winter, when many mountain stations coincide with a stable amount of snow and offer activities such as skiing and snowboarding.
