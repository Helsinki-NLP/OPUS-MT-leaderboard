Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in the white robe
He's a charismatic.
On the Mass of St. John's Mass of Relief and Healing, the crowds come.
He was a few decades old when things began to work inexplicably.
Today, through the Franciscan, others experience it.
For executed by O. Vitko messe St. about liberation and healing, the crowds
The parents of a 7-month-old who had a 7.5 mm hole in her heart came to him.
It was supposed to be operated.
Joseph Witko’s father prayed for him.
On the same day, the boy was taken to the hospital for surgery.
Surprised doctors said: “The surgery is not necessary, the loss is only 1.5 mm”.
My parents were crying for happiness.
After another prayer, the Franciscan hole disappeared completely.
The great spiritual activities of the Creator began to experience as a teenager.
In a dream, a clean soul came to him asking for help.
I was woken up at night and compelled to pray for the dead and those who died at that time – it is a memory.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what was going on with a man who was committing a deadly sin.
"My body began to change.
I've lost human traits and started picking up the animal's appearance," he says.
The invisible force took him up. He couldn't get his voice out of him.
He felt he was lost.
Then God gave him salvation.
"Low in the waters of the river symbolizing the christmas, I was set free and returned to human form..." he says.
He didn't tell anyone about these strange experiences.
There was a call in him.
He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.
In his sermons, he did more than tell about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience him alive.
Members of the Charisma Community Regained in the Holy Spirit
Father Witko’s health - care machines involve many people who are counting on him to get rid of the disease.
However, the spiritual one stresses that their primary goal is spiritual healing, not physical healing.
First defeat Kolpinga FRAC Jarosław
Today (September 26th) the afternoon team Kolpinga FRAC earned the current Polish champion Dartom Bogori Grodzisk Mazowiecki as part of the 3rd series of the Lotto Superligi Table Tennis.
Praised in such a personal set that they presented with the crucifixes have no chance of winning with the League's sovereigns.
He showed this one with Dart Bogoria.
The team still lacks the team leader Chen Jingqi.
Perhaps with him in the composition of the celebration they would reach third of a row of triumphs in the new season.
Young Asian Qiyao Han may not have grown up to win with such things as Greek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even one of the most promising Poles, Mark Badowski.
The player from Hellady was the largest single star in the MOSIR hall at Sikorski Street in Jaroslav.
Both old Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei were a class for themselves.
After three singles Kolping FRAC drove 2:1.
Kou Lei must have played the Badowski Mark, and Daniel Górak after an emotional, five-hundred-year-old battle – Pavla Siruck.
But then it was worse.
Gionis didn't give Lei a chance.
You could still hope for a two-point win, but Qiyao Han didn't make it to Badowski.
There will be no further research for seniors.
Why?
According to Rafál Trazskowski's predictions, a free preventive research program for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not been accepted by the Ministry of Health and is subject to the Agency for the Protection of Medical Technology and Tariffs.
The Agency therefore explained that the target group was not well chosen.
"These actions may, in fact, have an impact on the feasibility of individual disease units, which may contribute to deepening the difficulty in accessing NFZ services and have a negative impact on the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with false positive results of the studies," wrote.
The board's decision doesn't understand the president of the capital.
"The money is ours, we've planned it.
Only the government is afraid that if people are examined, they will later go to a doctor, which is absurd, because it is about bringing about a situation in which prevention can be carried out more quickly.
All experts know that it helps when it comes to the burden of the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and in the correct approach to health.
The government here has a very strange position that I don't understand," said Rafał Trazskowski.
"I find it hard to imagine that the current specialists are saying, 'Let's not go to the doctor's office, because there will be longer queues, and if these specialists advise the government, then I'm not surprised that in this state there is a health service," added PO policy.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all existing agreements
Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas announced on Thursday at the UN General Assembly that he would break any agreement with Israel if the future government of that country tried to comply with Benjamin Netanyahu's statement on the annexation of the occupied Palestinian lands.
"If the future government of Israel, which will rise, enters into the fulfillment of this plan, we will annul all the signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all the commitments made," he said.
"We reject completely and completely the whole plan," he threatened with pressing Abbas.
"It is our duty to defend all our rights with all possible means – little to say what these consequences will be – by fully engaging in the exercise of international law and in the fight against terrorism," said the President of the Palestinian Autonomous Authority, who had already made similar statements in July.
Netanyahu, now Israel’s Prime Minister, again received a government formation mission after the September 17 elections.
A week before the elections, he said that if he won, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and will include all Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank in Israel.
In the early 1990 ’ s, Israel and the Palestinians, led by Jaser Arafat, signed a number of peace agreements sponsored by the United States.
The 84-year-old Abbas also promised to conduct a general election in the Palestinian countries during the UN General Assembly session.
It was last held in 2006.
"After returning to the country, I called on the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem local elections and all those who would oppose them will have to answer for their actions before God and the international community," said the Palestinian President.
Abbas also defended in his speech the rights of Palestine, which was treated as a permanent observer in the United Nations, to exercise the powers of "full-fledged members of the United Nations and all its bodies and institutions".
The Palestinian leader concluded his call to the international community to "force Israel to comply with all the United Nations provisions".
Ambassador of Israel Danny Danon responded briefly to Abbas' speech, stating that the Palestinian leader "is willing to focus in the UN on the efforts of Palestinian Autonomousism directed against Israel rather than against calls for terrorism in Autonomousism under his leadership".
However, Danon, as the agencies note, did not refer to the Netanyah annexation of the occupied Palestinian lands.
Soldiers want defibrillators at the neurological points of thought
History from the border crossing shows that an automatic AED defibrillator can save human life.
Vojvojdka Ratunköping Station in Industry wants these devices to be at the city's nerve points.
For their position, the officials received congratulations from the Vojvojdz Retunkowtstation in Industry.
Applicant Daniel Cyrnek, Senior Applicant Grzegorz Ball and Commissioner Jacek Wójcik are officials of the Office of the Under-Carpice Treasure Customs in Industry.
On 28 August, they served on the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medici. The official of the Customs-Scarb Service noticed a man lying unconscious in a pedestrian's area.
The Chinese activist died in the arrest for torture.
He wanted to benefit from the rights guaranteed by the Constitution
Cao Shuxia, the wife of an activist, called on September 23rd the secretary of the Communist Party from her family village to announce that her husband had just died in the military hospital in Hengyang.
What was the cause of death – he did not reveal it.
In Cao's purse, she saw the body of a man slaughtered, not to be recognized.
"His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were all in the blood," says a woman.
"They didn't let me take the phones with them, and there were a lot of cops around who couldn't get close to Wang."
The police pressured her to sign a statement that her husband was seriously ill and that she died as a result of an "unfortunate accident".
105 million zł for companies from the video game industry from the National Research and Development Centre
Nearly $105 million of funding goes to gaming companies that create innovative solutions.
The National Research and Development Centre announced on Friday the results of the third edition of the GameINN programme.
Among the nearly 30 projects supported by the NCBR, for example, were the development of a field-based gaming platform based on the AR game engine that creates a real world map with an application that allows users to transmit data; a testing and training platform to verify practical skills at work and professional excellence using VR and AI technology; an innovative game that simulates real production processes using an innovative game model based on the interaction of the virtual world with the real world using the concept of industry 4.0 – the NCBR communication sent to the PAP Friday.
The aim of the GameINN sector programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game industry in the global market by 2023.
As NCBR reports, today the Polish video game sector is growing at a rate of 10% per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 was $1.85 billion and the forecast for 2019 is 2.23 billion.
"The specially prepared GameINN research agenda, which has already reached $300 million in support for entrepreneurs under this sectoral programme, is an important impetus for further, dynamic growth of the Polish gamedev", we read in the Communication.
The video game industry is a perfect example of the effective use of the potential we have in Poland.
"The government's incentives for innovative entrepreneurs, such as B+R benefits, skills development programmes, IP box or NCBR support programmes, encourage innovative companies and allow them to compete more effectively on the very competitive market," assesses Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the Communication.
The head of the Science Resort notes that money for innovation is not only used for innovation in the form of project funding, but is also in their pockets – three quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from B+R relief in 2018 than in the previous year.
‘The amount of the estimated costs related to the activity of B+R amounted to SEK 1.7 billion, which provided more than €300 million of savings for companies benefiting from this benefit.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by NCBR in the three editions of GameINN," the vice-premier stressed.
The Director of the NCBR, Dr. Dr. Wojciech Kaminieski, also recalls that in the two previous pre-financing tenders worth more than €211.2 million were awarded to 78 innovative projects.
The enormous interest in competition III and the diversity of the proposals submitted show that the video game industry has ideas and competences to further develop and enhance its competitive advantages.
"In particular, it welcomes the fact that, as in previous editions, there are projects relating not only to entertainment but also to industry 4.0", he adds.
In the third GameINN grant contest of up to $20 million, entrepreneurs, business consortium and business consortium could apply.
The NCBR had 87 applications for a total amount of about $317 million.
The tender budget at the time of the notice of invitation to tender amounted to SEK 100 million, but was increased, thus giving 27 projects almost USD 105 million of funding.
Details of the results of GameINN competition III are available on ncbr.gov.pl.
The Sectoral GameINN Programme is implemented under the Operational Intelligent Development Programme.
NCBR launched a programme in 2016 in response to the initiative of the business partners in the Polish Games Agreement, which includes companies such as CD Project, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team or 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga confessed to stealing Kasper Dolberg's watch
It was September 16th.
Dolberg, who came from Ajacs Amsterdam to Nice at the end of August, learned after training that his watch had disappeared from the closet.
It wasn't because it's worth 70,000 euros.
The next day, the angry Danish didn't show up in the classes, translating into stomach problems.
The thing from the beginning was mysterious.
The dancers in the closet have private safes available, and the club area is monitored.
According to the AFP, he finally admitted to stealing Diaby-Fadig.
The 18-year-old has already apologized to Dolberg and other colleagues from the team and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised that Denmark would return the money for the watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising players of a young generation in France.
He went to Nice as a 13th century to be debuted in the first team three years later.
He was in the seventh match this season.
He has recently signed a professional contract, but, as L'Equipe reported, the club is likely to dissolve it with immediate effect.
At the moment, a disciplinary procedure was in place against his opponent.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on this.
Make sure you wash your hands well
We all know we need to wash them (e.g. after coming home or before meals).
But not everyone knows that to actually get rid of the infections, we need to do it properly.
It's especially important now that the infections of the fall are approaching.
It takes at least 30 to 40 seconds to get the washing away of dangerous bacteria and viruses out of our hands enough
And most of us wash them shorter!
Enough hot water and ordinary soap – it's not true that it has to be antibacterial (many doctors don't care about them).
By washing, we wash not only the underside and the upper arms, but also: the ends of the fingers (attached or single) – cut them with the clumsy movements of the inside of the other hand, the space between the fingers (repay the hands, rub the fingers around them), the fingers – each finger is wrapped with the other hand, and in such a range we turn right and left.
In an emergency (when hands cannot be washed) we should shake hands with a wet spoon and then use antibacterial gel (in drugs, from 5 zł).
After using the public toilet, do not touch the wash hands or the door (recommendation of the Chief Health Inspectorate).
Open them through the paper handle.
Iran's President says that he rejected the proposal for US talks, Donald Trump denies
Tehran did not hold talks with the American side during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite the American offer to abolish the sanctions – Iranian President Hasan Rowhani said on Friday.
U.S. President Donald Trump commented that it was the Iranian side that requested the removal of restrictions that he did not agree to.
According to President Hasan Rowhani of Iran, the Americans have proposed abolishing all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiating a new international agreement.
It should regulate both Iran's nuclear programme and the ballistic impact building programme.
Rowhani: Iran will not take talks in the atmosphere of maximum pressure
The President of Iran stated that he did not agree to these talks because of the "toxic atmosphere".
He claimed that he had met with American diplomats because he had been hired by France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
However, he stressed that Iran would not speak in the "maximum pressure" atmosphere.
"And even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in 5+1 format, nobody is able to predict what the outcome will be," Rowhani said.
The day before, the Iranian leader said he did not exclude talks from the US, and the European parties to the nuclear agreement rejected the approval of US sanctions on Iran.
He added that the sanctions imposed on Iran after the US came out of a nuclear agreement "with an initial condition which does not allow" for dialogue.
If we are able to overcome this precondition and if America removes sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America – he said.
He added that he did not exclude a meeting with US President Donald Trump, although he did not agree to such a conversation in the coming week during the UN General Assembly.
Trump: "Iran asked, I said no"
Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that he rejected the request of the Iranian side.
“Iran wanted me to take the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course I said "no!" quoted the President of the United States.
Tension with the atomic agreement in the background
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to ease the tension between Washington and Tehran in some way to save the 2015 agreement with Iran, which they have been signatories to.
It stated that, in exchange for the abolition of economic sanctions, Iran would withdraw from the nuclear weapons building programme and that the nuclear sector would be subject to the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the withdrawal of the United States from the agreement in May 2015, its signatories have repeatedly confirmed their intention to maintain the agreement.
None of this worked out right now.
Washington is using the maximum pressure to Iran, and sanctions include a full embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran said that if it did not receive an export authorisation for raw materials, it would reduce its obligations resulting from the agreement every 60 days.

The judge of the Warsaw Military Court and the husband of Emilia, who, according to her words and screens from WhatsAppa, participated in the speech to the judges, was returned on Wednesday to be heard by the NSA.
The reason is that there has been no disciplinary procedure against him, so there is no basis for supporting the management of the WSA President Wojciech Mazura to remove him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a spokesperson for the NSA, initiated an investigation into Smydt at the end of August, but has not so far turned it into a case against him.
Although the NSA, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, must take the decision of the President of the WSA within one month of its publication.
In this situation, a judge who has publicly reported his wife's mental problems in order to discredit her, who has been removed from the KRS office because of suspicions of participation in the heterogeneous group, will return to office and will issue sentences on behalf of the Polish Republic.
Judge Smydt denies his participation in the Heather Group.
He claims that there is no evidence of this except for faked screens and his wife's words that he divorces.
That is exactly what the other judges who are involved in the "Casta" claim: they are all innocent, there is no evidence.
And it's quite possible that they'll put on their own.
Because the prosecutor didn't tip his finger to protect the evidence from their electronic carriers, he's also silent about the content of Emilia Smydt's phone, which stopped the phone in June in another case.
The police didn't tip their finger to protect the devices of the people they were being prosecuted for in a report from Judge Waldemar Žurek in February.
There's no evidence – there's no Smydt case, there's no "Casta" case.
There's also no case with Chief NIK Marian Banasi about renting stone to supporters and hiding income.
The CBA is checking his statement of assets.
And he'll check when he checks.
The Committee on Economic Ethics will also not deal with Banasis because the Seym is suspended (but the Committee of State Control has somehow gathered to take a queer decision to revoke the representatives of Banasis and to call as his lawyer, although the law of such a business combination does not provide for it).
The whole thing reminds me of a movie novel, an American mistake, about how a wife goes home and stops a husband with a lover in bed.
He's so surprised and confused that he can't say anything.
It stands in the door of the enemy, and at that time the lover jumps out of bed quickly, puts on and goes out.
And her husband made a bed.
When a wife regains her voice and cries out: What is this?
Who is this woman?
The husband calmly asks, "What woman, darling?"
It's just that "Casta" or "Banasia" is a state parody.
And that's not funny at all.

Camila Litzwinko in the final jump up
Previously returning to the season for the race after the maternity contest, the bronze medalist of the 2017 London World Championships won 1.85 and 1.89 in the first attempt and 1.92 in the second.
1,94 managed to achieve it only in the third approach.
"I'm happy.
I showed that I could fight because the first attempt was completely unsuccessful.
In the finals I'll have to jump better technically," she said to the Eurosport camera Litzwinko.
In the eliminations, the American Vashti Cunningham and the Belarusian Karina Demidik proved to be the best – after 1.94.
Both contestants as the only ones didn't lose any height.
The final jump above the women were scheduled for Monday.
Start at 7.30 p.m. in Polish time.
Cornel Morawiecki stays in a hospital in difficult condition
He went to the hospital, and his doctors define his condition as difficult.
You have to add that he's awake and aware.
“We believe that it will come out of this again.
We all pray for him to come back to health," said an anonymous close friend of Cornell Morawiecki in a conversation with the “Super Express” journalists.
In the upcoming elections, the Prime Minister is running for the Senate.
"I have the closest family and politics in my life," said Cornell Morawiecki in an interview he gave to Super Express journalists two weeks ago.
In January, he reported that the 78-year-old Cornell Morawiecki went to the Military Hospital in Wrocław.
“I had strange, disturbing symptoms and reported to the hospital.
Turns out I've got a yellowhead.
But the worst was before me.
When a computer tomography study was carried out, it was found that I had a brain tumor..." said the Prime Minister's father.
A few days later at MSWiA Hospital in Warsaw, Kornel Morawiecki went through a serious operation.
As Morawiecki said, President Andrzej Dud sent to the hospital of his personal chaplain, Prince Zbigniew Kras.
The operation lasted about three hours and passed successfully.
“I know a lot of people have prayed for me, and I thank you very much.
Luckily, I don't have any more passes.
I don't know if I'm going through chemotherapy yet.
I'm giving myself to doctors who are better at thinking.
At this point, I have to go back to some kind of state of use.
I hope everything is going to be okay," he said in January, in a conversation with "SE".
"If I had been studying too late, the situation would have been tragic and I would have said good-bye with this fall..." he added.
Kraków: 14-year-old missing
Officers from the City Police Command in Kraków are looking for 14-year-old Nel Stokłosa.
Anyone who has any information about the deceased is invited to contact.
The missing 26 September night came out of the place of residence and has not yet returned, nor has it come into contact with close friends.
She was last seen at the Old Guest Street in Krakow.
Nel Stokłosa is 14 years old, measuring 167 cm, has blonde hair and gray blue eyes.
When she was last seen, she was dressed in a shirt, grey under and shoes.
Anyone who has any information about the missing is invited to contact the police at No. 12 61-52-911, 12 61-53-616 or 112, 997.
The power of the lead jumps.
The title of the relationship with amateur sports professions, played on Sunday afternoon 15 September at the epidrome at Oleandra Street in Olav, may be for some misconceptions.
The real power of the road is far away, but that's exactly what one of the types of horse racing...
The competition for the power of the jumps is to fight by the rider and the horse of increasing obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed even two meters.
It is worth adding that the world's long and still unbeatable record, established in 1949 by Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the horse "Huaso", is 247 cm.
So high in Olava, of course, no one jumped, but the result of the best local Amazons at 135 cm is also not the worst...
The professions organised by the untrained Jan Sienkiewicz and other JKS "In Siolle" have been an indication of the early part of the "Precise driving professions", which we write more about in this issue of the paper, on page 22.
There have been eight Amazons who have been trained in the lead JKS.
Four were competing on hooks and four on big horses.
In the first group was best written by Nikola Szóldra, a mad "Sprinter".
This small, but dynamic rumac began from the defeat of 40 cm of spread obstacles and ended only at the station with a top bee distanced from the ground by 125 cm.
However, he did not give up easily, and only after three further refusals did the competition jury withdraw from further rivalry.
Amelia Pawlak took second place in the puppie jumps, reaching the "Fami", and the third Lena Borunj on the "Harmider".
She was the youngest tournament participant - Inga Aksman, galloping and jumping through obstacles to a small "Carmen" call.
Even greater emotions were associated with starting Amazon and seeing during the competition with large horses.
The dangerous falls included Paulina Szewczyk, who was arriving at the "Declaration" and Anastasia Abramenko, who drove to the "Lotce".
Luckily, neither the small oppression nor the Amazons nor the horses did anything wrong, so they continued to participate in the competition.
A lot of problems with introducing a young girl called "Wineta" to the park had to do with Veronika Lüczkiewicz.
She needed either an assistant coach or another horse to the pair, followed by some crazy "Wineta".
After counting the obstacle from the park, she also went full-time, so for a while in the boxing and the messroom became dangerous. "Everything is under control!" said Jan Sienkiewicz, calming down a bit of these frightened views, especially those of the youngest.
From the start of the competition of the great horses, Martha Masalska was a great woman in the parking lot, with a beautiful display of "Whisky".
This worthy call, in a couple of experienced Amazons, after the second approach in the final phase as the first jumped 135 cm and it was the best result of the professions at that time.
However, at the same moment Paulina Szewczyk was also counted as "Declaration", Veronika Lüczkiewicz as "Winece" and Anastasia Abramenko as "Lotce".
To decorate the flo and after receiving the prizes in the form of riding equipment, all these racers left together, and finally, together with the amazons in the march of Radecki, they carried out an effective round of honor, ending these interesting and exciting races.
Thank you
The Jäžděčki Sports Club "In Siodle" is cordially thanks to the sponsors of the jump power competition during XVI "Pacific Jäžděčkýs": the City Office in Olawa, the Waterways and Canalization Foundation in Olawa, the National Archives and the company "Mustang".
Max Kolonko departs from the KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko
The KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko is the name of the electoral committee under which the political formation #R Revolution Mariusza Max Kolonki was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution has led its proposal particularly to young voters with legal views.
Prior to the elections, Kolonko ordered cooperation with Mark Jacubiak, or Paul Kukiz, but none of these coalitions had arrived, and the Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko himself did not even be able to collect enough signatures to produce lists in any electoral district in Poland.
Now Kolonko informed on Twitter that he had completed his collaboration with the KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko.
"I'll expect from the KWW to delete my name from the name.
Please don't contact my person in/in that person," he added and said he would give more information soon.
At the moment it is not known whether the journalist will continue his work or whether it is the end of the #R Revolution.
On July 4th, on the American Independence Day, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko, who lives in the United States, informed of the emergence of a new political formation - #R Revolution.
In recent years, Kolonko has heard from the Max TV channel of YouTube, where he is commenting on events in Poland and the world.
"We have enough politicians, enough of your stupid games, enough of your amateur governments.
It is time for the authorities in the country to embrace the people and rule for the good of the people," Kolonko said.
The party's programme included, inter alia, matters relating to the judiciary (to be chosen in the general election), tax changes (comparison of tax-free for all), military repairs (as military assistance to the Eastern NATO Flanders, with particular regard to Poland), referendums on the possession of arms, the reduction of the number of envoys or the introduction of uniform electoral districts.
A few days after the creation of a new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko joined in talks with Mark Jakubiak.
At the end of July, Kolonko posted information on his profile in the social media suggesting that #R will connect forces with Kukiz'15.
However, none of these coalitions have finally arrived.
UBS: Gold close to balance point
"The euro course will last for the next few months in the area of trap 4,35 zł, which will accompany the weak economic situation in global markets," says Michael Bolliger of UBS Value Management.
"Achieving a steady pace of economic growth and a stable monetary policy are talking about stabilizing gold grades on the current trap," says Bankier.pl.
In his view, despite the clear inflationary pressure of the Monetary Policy Council, the Monetary Policy Council does not decide to raise its feet in an environment where the vast majority of central banks are slowing down politics.
“As far as gold is properly valued – euro ratings should be held in the next few months in the vicinity of a trap of €4.35 – so little attractive are Polish bonds according to it.
Much more profitable profitability than Polish paper offers bonds from emerging markets," says Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation on emerging markets with UBS Value Management.
According to experts, the main threat to the Polish economy is the worsening of the world economy.
"The global slowdown can yet be deepened, but there should not be a serious recession, and, above all, the decline in GDP dynamics is not significantly below zero," Michael Bolliger says.
"Investments should be underestimated by global actions that may damage the prospect of a US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including the Donald Trump impeachment procedure and brexit.
Europe should be relatively weak among the stock markets", according to the latest letter to the investors of the main managing authority of UBS Value Management Mark Haefele.
"The euro area shares should behave worse than the US, because they are more vulnerable in conditions of increased uncertainty about global trade and concerns before the slowdown," we read in the document.
According to Michael Bolliger, once the boss of the bond markets of the safest countries has pushed the profitability of Germany’s 10-year-olds down to less than 0.74 per cent, it is still possible to deepen its profitability.
However, in the longer term, the profitability of long-term and short-term securities should no longer fall due to the smoothing of monetary policy of banks.
The biggest field to lower feet has Fed, which should lead to a weakening of the US currency over the next few years.
The long-term balance sheet for euro banknotes is a envelope of USD 1.29, which would mean a 19 per cent potential for strengthening the single currency to the dollar.
We expect further reductions in Fed's feet, which will result in a reduction in the world's monetary policy differences.
"In order to maintain the long-term force of the dollar, there may be no deficits on the current and budgetary account," Michael Bolliger says.
The Bundeswehr is losing his weapons.
German Mon report
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehra has noted the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 parts of weapons and 19,445 ammo – resulting from a confidential set of RFN defence facilities.
She informed the press belonging to the Media Group EditationsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
According to a document from the Parliamentary Office of the Secretary of State at MON Peter Tauber (CDU), two weapons, one part of weapons and 3474 ammunition have been remeasured.
Among the military equipment that remains missing are: six MG3, 11 G3, four G36, six signal guns and two P8 guns.
In addition, 30 lufs are missing for MG3 machine caravans.
The situation was alarmed by the Vice-President of the Left Party, Martin Renner.
As RND journalists have said, the number of missing weapons and ammunition is "surprising".
More than that, only a small part of the lost equipment was found in the investigation.
Martina Renner summarised the effects of these actions as a "necessary balance".
She also hid the fact that the kit did not show whether there was a weapon found in the investigation against Lieutenant Bundeswehry Franco A. In December 2017, the Federal Prosecutor in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence that threatened the security of the state and of violating the provisions of the law governing access to firearms.
The officer was accused of preparing attacks on German policies with extreme legal and racist motives.
His "black list" of goals, which had fallen into the hands of the prosecutor, included the then Minister of Justice Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, human rights defender and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung Foundation in Berlin.
Franco A. entered illegally into possession of four firearms, more than 1,000 ammunition and more than 50 explosive charges.
Crying kids on the plane.
How can we avoid them?
There's a solution.
The Japanese Airlines carrier has recently used a function designed for the purpose of people for whom travelling in the company of a crying child is a nightmare.
By means of the Internet site, the lines allow to check the layout of the seats on the plane.
If the connection concerned travels less than a year to the second year of life, the "child icon" will appear on a specific, reserved seat by parents or caregivers.
Accordingly, the person using the services of the carrier has the option of choosing a place away from that occupied by the minor.
The BBC reports that the lines have already reported the failure of this solution.
"Children's icon" shall not appear when the ticket has been booked by a third party or if a change of aircraft has occurred at the last moment.
As expected, the idea was shared by internet users.
Some Twitter users point out that the problem of travelling with crying children can be solved by listening to noise reduction.
They're kids, and we used to be them.
"We need to learn tolerance, because we will soon need maps of places for breathers, diners or drinks," user G Sundar wrote.
Another of the netizens noticed that at one time he was disturbed by crying children on the plane, but changed his mind when he became a parent himself.
There is also a lack of solutions from Japan Airlines.
"Thank you for warning me against screaming children during a 13-hour trip," wrote Rahat Ahmed.
Major counts losses after bankruptcy of the Thomas Cook Travel Office
More than 25 thousand foreign tourists will not arrive in October on a holiday to Majorca as a result of the announcement on Monday of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook's travel office.
As the representatives of the Balearic government of Marc Pons, among the 25 thousand journalists who will not be able to take advantage of the October leave in Majorce, are also those who were to travel with companies directly related to Thomas Cook, such as Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80% of the expected contemporaries who, due to the fall of the British company, had to give up their retirement in Majorce next month were German citizens and Scandinavian states.
However, according to Pons, Thomas Cook did not drive tourists to the Balearic island in November-April, the losses for the local economy will be smaller.
He stated that the Balearic government had already started negotiations with international operators on "the entry into the market of Majorka" after the bankruptcy of the British operator.
The estimates of the newspaper "Diario de Mallorca" show that in October due to the tourist crisis in Majorce, more than 1,000 people are losing their jobs.
About 800 were released by Thomas Cook's office in Palmie.
Other people will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel sector.
On Monday, along with the announcement of bankruptcy by Thomas Cook in many Majorka hotels, the property owners asked guests to collect an additional overnight fee.
This situation has been experienced, among other things, by several dozen tourists from Poland.
The Balearic Government estimates that by Thursday several decades of hotels in Majorce have stopped at least by the end of October due to the announcement of the fall by Thomas Cook and the companies working with him.
In turn, the "Diario de Ibiza" newspaper, "Diario de Ibiza", shows that the majority of the hotels in Ibiza, who have worked with Thomas Cook group, do not deal with the intention of closing the premises in the coming weeks.
The newspaper recalls that on this Balearic island British bankrut cooperated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the Balearic authorities announced that they would call on the Spanish Government to support the region with EUR 100 million to cover the losses caused by the bankruptcy announcement by the Thomas Cook travel agency.
They found that the most damaged on this tourist archipelago, about 36,000 people, is located in Majorce.
According to data from the Balearic government, Thomas Cook is dependent on a local tourist company, mainly hotel operators, for the implementation of contracts for the period from July to September 2019 of around EUR 5 million.
Ranking FIFA women.
Poland still in 29th place, USA in front
Women's representation of Poland takes 29th place in the International Football Federation (FIFA) ranking, published on Friday.
At the same position, the team of Coach Milosz Stäpinski was classified in the previous July kit.
Weak team games.
How will it be in October?
The rest of the Americans are leaders who have recently defended the title of the world's champions.
The second place in the ranking was the Germans, and the third was the Dutch.
The Poles are preparing to qualify as ME.
They were supposed to start with a ski match with the Czechs on September 3rd.
The day before the meeting, it was overloaded, due to food poisoning, for one year.
In this situation, Poland will renew qualifications by meeting with the Spanish on November 12th in Lublin.
Previously, "White-Red" played two games – October 3rd on departure from Cyprus, and five days later in Kielcach with Brazil.
Poland's rivals include Spain, Czech, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
Winners of the groups and three best teams from elsewhere advance directly to the final tournament.
The other six teams from the other positions play in bars with the last three passes to the European Championships.
The rate of 16 participants will be added by the owner – England.
The male representation of Poland in the September FIFA ranking fell from 20. to 22.
'Rz': Smog has been driven by the government
"The effects of the Clean Air programme are zero, and the coal furnaces will kick this winter as if nothing ever happened," we read on the front page of today's "Rzeczpospolitje".
"To date, 82,000 applications have been made under the Clean Air programme for funding of a total value of €2 billion, of which 48 thousand have been positive.
The accepted proposals amount to more than €915 million," he said, referring to data from the Minister of the Environment.
According to the newspaper, only part of the costs incurred are reimbursed from the programme.
The results of the noise programme are considered to be "small".
Self-governments quoted by "Rz" are looking at the defeats of "Czysté Air" in too large a bureaucracy.
"The programme should be much simpler: e-reporting, e-mailing, possible verification of implementation.
This would improve action," said Mayor Lidzbark of the Warminian Jacek Wisniowski.
Activists from the Polish Smog Alarm also note that in the first year of operation, less than 1% of the planned target for the exchange of 3 million poplars was achieved.
As Rz notes, although the programme budget is $103 billion for 10 years, or $10 billion a year, this amount is virtual.
"The National Fund for the Protection of the Environment and the Water Economy budget for this year has been reserved by $1.4 billion," we read.
Congress agrees on F-35 for Poland
Blister: Now price negotiations
Congress of the United States agreed to sell Poland 32 of the latest F-35 aircraft.
"It's one of the last steps before the contract is concluded, but it's not the end of our work," Mariusz Błasčkak wrote on Twitter.
"We will negotiate hard to achieve the best price," the Polish Minister added.
Agreement on the Polish F-35
The Polish air forces to strengthen target 32 F-35 Lightning II hunters produced by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, Poland agreed to their sale by the US Department of State.
The Communication stresses that investment in national security and US foreign policy by improving NATO's security, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
Information from the Department of State indicates that Poland is to pay $6.5 billion for fishermen.
However, this is not the final price.
The Department of State noted that the contract would also include the delivery of spare parts and repairs, training equipment, the provision of engineering, logistics and personnel services and related elements of logistics and programme support and training.
Thinker Lockheed Martin F-35
Thinker F-35 Lightning II produced by Lockheed Martin is a multi-stakeholder fifth-generation multi-stakeholder.
The aircraft is capable of carrying out a mission of close support, bombing and typically air combat fishing.
Using stealth technology, the fisherman is undetectable for radar near range.
Recently, F-35 fishermen bought Belgium under a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want to replace the old F-16.
The purchase of U.S. warplanes is also to be considered by other US allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Gendery dolls
The manufacturer of Barbie introduced a series of sex neutral dolls on the market.
He wants to fight stereotypes like that.
Barbie manufacturer introduced a series of sex neutral dolls to the market
Next to Barbie with different skin colors, figures or hairstyles, Mattel introduced the sale of a neutral doll sexually.
Toys from the "Creable World" series carry wigs.
Therefore, children can decide whether their Barbie should have short hair or long hair.
Their wardrobe consists of both underwear and dresses.
In the blink of an eye, dolls can become boys and vice versa.
They are also available in different skin colors and with different clothes.
It was also rejected by emphasising the characteristics of sex – gender dolls no longer have full mouth, long legs and squeaky waist or, in the case of Kena, broad shoulders.
The company feels that children don't like their dolls having sex norms, and some parents and feminists are convinced that toys made with a specific sex are blocking girls' ambitions and strengthening traditional stereotypes.
"The new dolls will allow all children to feel free," says Mattel.
The barbie, who appeared on the market in 1959 in the bathroom and shoes on high ground, has in the past been repeatedly criticized for promoting “unnatural female stereotypes”, such as unnatural body proportions.
The group has responded to criticism and has already introduced the doll market with different skin colors, as well as more rounded shapes.
The dolls also appeared in the hijab.
Zandberg: Close or Club Together can have several messengers
Zandberg asked the ZET radio, how many candidates of his party can get to the left-wing SLD (KW SLD from which the SLD, Spring and Left-wing SLDs start together, starting with the joint "Left" logo), replied that this depends on the result of the committee.
"I believe that the outcome of the Left will be very good, because we feel that people are bound to hope that the Left is not only right but also powerful," he said.
According to Zandberg, the left may have 60 to 80 ambassadors.
“This may mean that either the club or the club together will have several hundred ambassadors.
But it depends on Poles and Poles.
I'm not going to agree and tell you how this will happen," he said.
Asked whether the Left would have a separate circle, Zandberg objected: “We are agreed that we are different, and we will not pretend that this diversity does not exist.
I think that this diversity has been rewarded by the Poles because we have shown that by different means, we have been able to agree on a common programme."
Asked whether the biggest beneficiary of the joint start-up was the leader of the SLD Vłodzimir Czarzasty, Zandberg replied that in his opinion the biggest beneficiaries were the central left-wing and left-wing voters.
In view of the fact that the SLD will receive the entire subsidy, he denied that "the political party's goal is to represent its constituents".
Zandberg admitted he'd vote for himself in the Seimas elections.
In the case of the Senate elections, he pointed out that he was wondering.
"The offer is diverse and in this offer there are candidates and candidates to whom my heart is closer, but there are also those to whom my heart is further," he said.
"I would, however, say very honestly and clearly that if I had found myself in section 44 of the Senate, I would have taken an election certificate and voted in another district," he said.
"I don't think I would have tried to vote for the Minister of the Uzbek (KO-PAP)," he added.
In this district outside the Driveway, the leader of the People's Republic of RP Paweł Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS are starting.
Dakar: Open biggest match in West Africa
Tens of thousands of people from all over Senegal gathered on Friday in the capital for the inauguration of a huge mosque, considered the largest in West Africa.
The Muslims arrived by bus, car and foot in the Bopp district, where there was a new mosque that could accommodate 30,000 faithful.
The facility was built by the Mouride Brotherhood, which belongs to the Sufical Nurse of Islam, which dominates Senegal.
Work on the machete began ten years ago in a submerged area with a surface area of six hectares transmitted by the government.
The name of Massalikul Jinan ("The Paths to Paradise") is derived from the title of Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century founder of the brotherhood, honored by the confessors as saints.
The machete is covered with career marble and has five minerals.
The tallest one is 78 meters.
The mosque inside is home to 15,000 believers, and the other can be on the outside.
In the rich finished interiors you can admire the lovely dome, giant gyrandols and decorations handmade by workers from Morocco.
The builders claim that the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but there is no comparison between the mosque and the mosque in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassana II mosque in Casablanca can accommodate 105 thousand faithful.
The construction of the mosque, which cost more than EUR 30 million, was financed from private donations.
The government, in addition to the land, founded lighting, sanitation and financing road work worth EUR 10.5 million.
Coach Smile: Our problem is not Słęsk, just us
The pass of eight leagues without winning the Cup of the Crowns will try to break up in the Friday meeting with the vice-leader of the extraclass Słasko.
"Our problem is not to get involved, just us, we have to work on what we play," said coach Mirosław Smyla.
The crown divers last and as until now the only victory in the league was scored in the first row when they won the 1.0 Benjaminka games of the Common Cancers on their way.
The call was followed by two resignations and six defeats, and on Tuesday they lost 0:1 with the Deep Lubin in 1/32 final of the Polish Pucharu.
“I am encouraged by the optimism that in the last few seconds, the footballers were fighting for the door, trying to give up.
Their fall on the wall after the last star didn't come from breaking, it was just a fall of anger because they were so close," Smyla said.
As he pointed out, Słęsk has very strong wings, so he will feel a team to play in side sectors of the bodice.
"We have the awareness of the quality of the opponent, but we also look at what we want to play," the coach added.
In the fifth match in the Crown, there will certainly be no playing pause for too many yellow cards of Ognjan Gnjatic, in the frame will also miss the conjugated Jacob Žubrowski and Michael Gardawski.
Building, on the other hand, is reporting in a poker game of several players willing to play.
"We have headaches, it seemed recently that he will not be, and now he is," said Smile.
Defendor of the Crown Daniel Djiwniel stressed that Switzerland would not be an easy rival to break the belts of eight leagues in a row without victory, while in the extraclass everyone can win with everyone.
"We're a good team.
In recent weeks we may not be showing this at the battlefield, but the moment will come when we will win and believe that it will be Friday," the footballer said.
After nine rows of extraclas of the Crown with five points, it takes 15th position.
Słęsk gathered 12 more and was placed in the second place.
The match in Kieltz will start at 8:30 p.m.
These trees can disappear completely from Europe
"42% of species of trees making up the woodland of Europe are at risk," the International Union for the Protection of Nature (IUCN) warns, published on Friday in the "European Trees Red Book".
The front of the list includes cassettes and jarabine.
IUCN, an organisation based in Gland, Switzerland, publishes a list of endangered species of European trees for the first time.
It has been developed by experts who have come to the conclusion from research that 42% of the 454 species of trees in Europe (and elsewhere) are "highly endangered".
Among the reasons the Red Book exchanges the rapid growth of urban agglomerations and global climate change.
However, the most endangered are those trees and furs that occur only or mainly on our continent.
As regards typical European woodland, according to IUCN experts, 58% of species are at risk, and 15%, i.e. 66 species of trees and trees, are threatened with extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation The Red Book exchanges errors in the exploitation of woodland, accelerated urbanisation, too intensive logging, and further forest fires and changes occurring in the European ecosystem.
According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of fur, fur and growth is also highly threatened.
"The consequences of human activities lead to the gradual disappearance of European plant species and create in Europe the risk of the disappearance of important and underestimated variations that form the basis of European ecosystems and have an impact on the health of our planet," said Luc Bas, who is running the European IUCN office.
Grzegorz Sketina: I don't promise 600+
"Today PiS wants to buy Poles, offering them freedom of disposal for a loan that will have to pay for the next generation," says Grzegorz Schetina in the "Rzeczpospolitje" story.
In his opinion, "the whole PiS policy is pic".
At the same time, policies promise that "what is given will not be prohibited".
Shetyna assures Jack Nisinkiewicz in his conversation with him that he has the idea of fighting the law and justice.
It's about mobilizing the electorate at polling stations.
In his view, the opposition has greater potential in this regard than the Kaczynski party.
"Today, the conscious people who want to live in a normal state are more than supporters of the PiS, a party that has been opposed to the values voted on, such as modesty, humility, transparency," Sketina says.
The head of the Citizens' Coalition and the President of the Citizens' Platform also noted the basic foundations of the KO electoral programme.
"First of all, nothing will be taken away, but the direction to the future needs to be set, because PiS is only dealing with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which can be seen after a dramaticly low investment," he said.
Secondly, it is "the movement of Polish energy, aid and investment in those who are genuinely working - and those who are entrepreneurs".
Shetina explains that the KO program includes a project that will give Poland’s least earner more than 614 gold per hand and more earner – also after several hundred.
Politicians have also noted that they do not want to pursue remoteness.
As he said, he'll do as much as he can, but he won't promise 600+.
"I will never allow the Greek option, where the rulers have challenged the opposition to remoteness, until the financial collapse of the country has finally come," he stressed.
The Sketin in the interview for "Rz" also found that Jarosław Kaczynski and Mateus Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Malgorzat Kidaw-Blonsk.
"We would abuse their hypocrisy and propaganda," he said.
"Physy is a step ahead of a fall.
Kaczynski is such a man of state as Banas is a crystal," he added.
Leader PO also said that he had not yet decided whether to apply for the presidency of the Platform.
Argentina: Six Great Dead Condors
In the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, six large dead condors were found – TVN24 informs.
Experts believe that human activity has contributed to their deaths.
Large condors are likely to be poisoned by means of the killing of predators such as pumas, foxes or wild dogs.
The animals could have eaten toxic paraffin.
In addition to one young person, the rest of the dead condors were grown up.
"It is a great loss to the environment, because the condor must reach 10-15 years in order to become fertile and able to multiply.
So we lose a protected species, a endangered species," says Luis Jacome, Director of BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental organization.
"I think that the use of toxic bait and poison is not only a threat to this species, but all other forms of life, including human health," he adds.
"Rz": They want a jewel for the President
Work on the recognition of the head of the costly chain.
The idea was supported by the office of Andrzej Dudy – we read in "Rzeczpospolitje".
According to the press, the gold chain of the Order of the White Eagle, the royal insignia officially called during the time of the inter-war jewel of the Royal Police.
Last time, he was probably used by the President of the Mystic Ignacy.
"Rz" indicates that soon such a chain can hit Andrzej Dudy's shoulder.
The Senate Commission on Human Rights, Justice and Petitions voted on Wednesday to propose a work on the renewal of the Orders and Marks Act in order to restore it.
The journal says that this is also not the first attempt to restore this chain to the head of the state.
The Senate had already proposed this amendment in 1992, but it fell by one vote.
This time, work is brilliant.
At the beginning of August, the senators devoted a few minutes to this matter, recognizing that they would reach the President's office's opinion.
This one came in mid-September.
"I am pleased to inform you that the Office of the President of the Republic does not pay any attention to the position set out in this petition," President Andrzej Dera then wrote.
On Wednesday, the senate committee continued the case and again devoted little time to the matter.
"The Office of the President replied briefly: it is for this to be restored," said Commissioner Robert Mamoutow of PiS, quoted by Rz.
He submitted a proposal for legislative work, which the Commission supported.
Cops will teach drivers how to drive by crossing
Police action will be conducted, inter alia, on the crossing of Al. Cieplinski from Al. Pilsudski.
The uniforms have something to do with recent complaints by the city authorities about drivers not always able to behave properly on the crossing.
On Friday, 27 September, police officers are launching preventive "Transport crossings" in Rzesz.
It is about eliminating traffic difficulties: crossing without being able to leave, not applying to light signals or road signs.
"We often think that we are alone on the cross, and so we really make life difficult for other drivers," said Marek Ustrobinski, the city's vice president a few days ago.
His words sounded at a press conference in which the city authorities presented examples of inappropriate car movements after crossings, resulting in corkscrapers.
At that time, the president appealed to passengers to reason on the road and, among other things, to move faster on the lights or not to text during the ride.
Somehow the Soviet police have taken over, starting today with the action "Transport crossings".
What's the matter?
The aim of the action is to eliminate the phenomenon of cross-border crossings by drivers travelling on them without the possibility of continuing their journey.
This is a frequent exacerbation that contributes to the strengthening of traffic difficulties and the creation of bumps.
He is threatened with a fine of 300 zł and 2 criminal points.
In addition, the uniforms will pay attention to non-application of light signals or road signs and incorrect parking in the crossing area.
They will also observe the lack of fluidity of the drive, the late movement of signallers, the free passage of crossings and the remaining too long distance between vehicles.
On what crossroads will action be taken?
I.e. on Lisa-Kuli street from Jagiellońska street; al. Cieplinskia from al. Pilsudskie; Targowi Street from al. Pilsudskie; Sreniavitów Place from ul. Dąbrowskie or Hetmanskie Street from al. Insurgent Warsaw.
This type of stock will be held in the capital of Podcarpaca in the next five October.
They've controlled a company that's using the waste from "Cajika"
"The officials of the Department of Environmental Protection of the Old Town of the Volominian and Governmental Inspection of the Construction Supervisory Control checked on Friday the installations in the municipality of Zielonka, where waste from the "Czajka" sewage treatment plant in Warsaw is used," said a spokesperson for the Old Town of the Volominian Karol Szyszko.
The inspectors of the Volomenian era carried out controls at a plant located in the forests of the village of Zielonka.
The "Dar-Trans" Private Business-Trans transport facility, under the agreement with the central sewage treatment plant "Czyka", performs waste management services.
"A survey of the installation was carried out, and an entrepreneur was also asked to provide documentation related to his activities," Szyszko said.
He added that the follow-up report would be transmitted, inter alia, to the Environmental Protection Inspectorate in Warsaw.
The last check in "Dar-Transie" was carried out by the Voivodship of the Environmental Inspectorate in Warsaw from 29 December 2015 to 11 February 2016.
It was then found that the company did not take samples, measurements and groundwater tests and did not have the results of the studies of the stabilized municipal irrigation plants from the "Cajika" sewage treatment plant.
Following the verification of VIOŠ, Darius Saturday was called upon to stop violating the terms of the decision.
DAR-TRANS is one of the companies that receives waste in the form of stabilized municipal sewage plants from the cleanup "Czyka".
According to the decision to use waste on the production site, in forests around the Greenhouse, wastes of up to 60,000 tonnes per year are processed.
The Warsaw City Enterprise Waterways and Canalization reported last Thursday that in November and December 2018, STUOŠ was disabled from operation, which was associated with the damage of one of the firefighting devices.
According to MPWiK, the monthly cost of their exports is SEK 1.7 million (calculated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Walussa supported Malgorzata Kidawa-Blonska.
"You have taken on a difficult task, you can count on my full support," Lech Waluss told Malgorzata Kidawa-Blonski on Friday.
"Mr President, this is a very important word for me," replied the candidate of the Citizens' Coalition to the Prime Minister, the leader of the KO list in Warsaw.
The former president stressed that when it comes to the situation in Poland, it is now "only a piece of retirement".
Malgorzata Kidawa-Blońska met with former President Lech Walaus in his office at the Gdansk European Solidarity Centre on Friday.
In a brief conversation behind closed doors, the son of Wałęsa – Jarosław also took part.
"You took on a difficult task," he said after meeting Lech Wallus.
"You can count on my full support," he added.
"The problems facing Poland are known to all of us.
It is therefore a great hope that you, as a woman, will deal with these problems, and we, all of us, who love Poland, will support your actions as much as possible," said the President, turning to Kidawa-Blonsky.
Very Important Words
Kidawa-Blonska thanked you for your support.
"Mr President, this is very important to me, because nobody like you can talk about freedom, about the constitution and what it means," she said.
"Let us show that another wise policy can be made, together, but in accordance with the Constitution, in accordance with the law, in accordance with respect for others.
That's how you did your revolution, and that's how we want to change Poland," Kidawa-Blonska said.
Kibic on retirement
Wałūsa said in a conversation with journalists that she is now "only a retired person".
"Of course I'm looking at it.
I hope that we will reverse the course of events that we will return to what was good, proven (to do so).
The division of power is the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are essential.
And all of this needs to be cleaned up, all of this needs to be restored to normal activity, and I believe we're doing it this time.
'Cause if you don't, we'll be on the street," said Lech Waluss.
"That is why it is so important for the Polish to go to the elections, make their own decisions and make their own decisions.
And that's the most important," said Kidawa-Blonska.
"The last chance to improve the state of things in Poland by a card," the former president replied.
"We need to build on a new foundation"
Asked about the most important changes to be made to Poland, Kidawa-Blońska said: "The President said very well.
We need to build on a new foundation on which we can do all the other things.
Since there is no triad of power, since the constitution is not respected, we must return to the beginning and bring it to light and let everyone know that otherwise Poland will not move forward."
ME netizens: Slovenia – Poland 3:1 in the semifinal.

The Senate has decided on key laws
The Senate adopted, without amendment, the law on the disclosure of family assets of the most important public officials and the airline of the most important persons in the country.
As a result of the amendment of the state officials' family property law, 52 senators voted, 14 opposed, and three abstained.
The senators therefore decided to reject 12 amendments tabled during the middle debate by Senator PO Slavomir Fibicki.
According to him, the amendments had the law to "civilize" and to limit the scope of the statement on the property situation of own children, of the children of the spouse, of children adapted to cases where children remain in the common household with the person responsible for making the statement.
The Law on the Publicity of Family Property of the most important State Officials, whose project was established at the Prime Minister's Office, was adopted by the Seim on 11 September.
The provisions stipulate that, inter alia, the Prime Minister, Ministers, Ambassadors, Ambassadors to the EP, Senators, Presidents: the Constitutional Court, the Chief Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as persons in charge of other State institutions, will be obliged to place in the statement of property information on the personal property of spouses, children and persons remaining in common interest.
The Senate also did not propose amendments to the law on the air of the most important persons in the country.
It regulates which flights have the status of HEAD and who can be on board government aircraft together with the most important persons in the country.
The Act also specifies who is responsible for the implementation of the Central Register of Lots.
The law, without amendment, said 55 senators, 12 opposed, four abstained from the vote.
In accordance with the law, each flight of the President will be a flight "made in an official mission".
In flights the president will be able to accompany family members and others invited by the president.
On the other hand, the mission of the official Prime Minister and the Marshals of Sejm and the Senate will only be "made to carry out tasks directly related to the performance of the function".
The Act also specifies the list of persons who may accompany the most important persons in the country during the flight.
Members of the delegation may be invited, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts on board; persons providing technical, medical or organisational support; and journalists.
In accordance with the law, if there is any doubt about the flights of the Sejm and the Senate, the head of the KPRM will have to explain them.
If such doubts are not clarified at the specified time, the Head of the KPRM will be obliged to notify the heads of the Seim Office or the Senate of the absence of an organisation of such a flight.

This time, without such problems, they went to Paris with the Slovenian charter on Friday afternoon, and a few hours later they were training in the famous Bercy hall.
According to the report, the world’s master’s trainers were undernourished.
As Assistant Heynen Mikhał Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not the same exercise of networking elements.
“We went to the hall, but it was a time for the team in the vast majority.
It was about spending more time together than training.
Talk, think about how to rebuild everything as a team," he related.
He confirmed that half-final failure was a painful lesson for both athletes and training staff.
"We were brutally taken to the ground.
Without two opinions, we're disappointed.
We still believed we were going back to this game.
We were discussing this match in the stadium, the coach talked a lot to the contestants.
As two main causes of failure, I would point out the inefficiency in the attack and much worse than simply dealing with the situational balls.
In this regard, the Slovenians were much better than us," he analyzed.
In his opinion, the "White-Red" on the obstacle did not become the stress associated with the speech against supported by the loud and numerous audiences of the co-operators of the tournament.
He admitted that the world's champions could sleep a little smooth way to the semifinal.
“Maybe if we had a similar-style defeat in the group phase, we would have looked at this lesson more quickly and then play at the next stage of the tournament.
But it's just a spell," he said.
Gogol hopes that the anger associated with the Thursday defeat of the Poles will turn into an aggression in the brown match.
“I hope that we will then show our true faces.
It's about what to fight.
Last time we fought the ME medal in 2011," he recalled.
Paris is the fifth city, and France is the third country visited by the Polish during these championships.
At the group stage they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, at the first two meetings of the group, they went to Apeldoorn, and to the semifinal they moved to Ljubljana.
Nick Kyrgios: a cruel punishment, but suspended
Australian tennis player received a 16-week startup ban and a fine of $25,000, in half a year's suspension, for presumptuous words, gestures and acts during the last ATP tournaments.
The ATP World Tour operators are losing patience with Kyrgios, but they're still giving him a chance to improve.
The summary of the performances of the most unbundled professional tennis player in recent years seems dangerous – 16 weeks of break plus a lot of crime, but both are suspended for half a year – a trial period in which a season sportsman can improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he's been breaking up for a long time now and has made his own tennis record of the world – he has had to pay the highest in the history of discipline a single financial penalty for breaking the rules of conduct on the court and next to it.
Loud curses, strange gestures, unsportable behaviour, injury to the judge and vision, breaking two rockets during a losing match with Karen Chachanov – for all this after the August ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati paid 113 thousand dollars.
In the U.S. Open 2019 he didn't play for long, but he managed to tell the public that the ATP operators were "scrupulous", which hurt the organisation so much that they conducted a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgyz and, after a couple of weeks, they gave the verdict on suspension of the start and the next crime.
However, the word about corruption has been forgiven, after hearing the accused and knowing the context of the statement.
However, in the case of tennis, the investigation showed that Kyrgios’ behaviour over the last 12 months has in many cases raised serious concerns and constituted an almost continuous violation of the rules, that he has repeatedly injured the person involved in tournaments and sights, from there a high penalty.
However, ATP gave him five days before the appeal and immediately suspended the execution of the sentence, ordering him to comply within the next six months with a few conditions: in the ATP Tours and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgios tournaments, he cannot in any way violate the rules of the Code of Conduct of Current Professional Tennisists, in particular, he can no longer curse, destroy rockets, fight judges and the public, nor any other way of acting unconventional and vulgar.
He was also advised to seek "continuous support" from mental coaches during the tournaments and also outside the season to consult with people who specialize in solving the problems of athletes who do not manage to behave properly.
Nick Kyrgios’s first comment on the verdict was: “Hey, everybody, I can still play.
I just have to control my behavior, that's all."
In practice, the Australian will have at least a two-week break, because in Pucharza Laver, he had to quit the boat and quit from the nearest start in Beijing (September 30th – October 6th) and Shanghai (October 6th – 13th).
The ATP Kyrgios ranking takes 27th place.
This year he won two tournaments – in Washington and Acapulco, earned more than $1.3 million, so even after the fines he will have many.
GUS: Life is getting better in Poland
The report published by the GUS on household budgets on Friday shows that, as a good or rather good material situation, up to 44% of households assessed their material situation.
This percentage was 37.2% earlier in 2016, 33.5% earlier, when the statistical office first examined the subjective estimates of the situation of households, never exceeded 30%.
Its material situation was considered to be bad or rather bad, in the sub-year, by 8.1% of households, compared to 11.2% earlier and more than 20% in 2009.
The best situation is the material situation of the households of the self-employed.
In this group, 70% of respondents considered it to be good or rather good.
In the second run, there are home-run farmers, where the percentage of such responses was only 18%.
The number of children also has a significant impact on the subjective assessment of the material situation of households.
The worst is known to parents alone raising offspring, of which the good or rather good material situation declares 32%.
Among couples with children, this weight (depending on the number of children) ranges from 55% to 60%, and among childrenless households is 48.8%.
These statistics clearly show the effect of the 500+ programme.
Before it was launched (in 2016) their worst material situation was assessed by single parents raising offspring and multi-year families (with at least three children).
Improving the subjective assessments of Poland's material situation is a reflection of rapid income growth, especially from work.
However, this is not all because the percentage of households that consider their situation to be good increases faster than real income.
Moreover, there is no clear link between income levels and the assessment of the material conditions of households.
The best evaluations are formulated by the inhabitants of the Polish voivodeship, where they consider their situation to be good or rather good 48.9% of the researchers.
There are also Ljubian Voivodships (47.7%), Silesian (47.6%), Masovian (47.3%) and Western Pomerania (47.1%).
Meanwhile, in Opolska, the government income (i.e. after tax and tax payments) was 94% of the national average and 98% of the national average.
The highest incomes were for the residents of Mazowieski (120% of the national average) and for Silesia (104%).
On average in Poland, the person's administrative income was EUR 1693 per person in 2018.
In real terms (as adjusted for price changes), it increased by 4.3% by 2017.
On the back of the last few years, it's been pretty low.
In 2016, income per person increased by 7% and by 6.3% a year later.
Although income growth is slowing down, it also inhibits expenditure growth.
These per person were calculated in sub.1187 zł, which means that in real terms they were reduced by 0.7%.
This is the first such case since 2013.
In 2017, expenditure per person has actually increased by 1.9% and in 2016 by 4.3%.
Studies in household budgets suggest that the household statistics currently account for 70.1% of its regulatory revenue, while this share still exceeded 80% in 2014 and exceeded 90% in 2006.

USA: Three suicides among the aircraft crew
Three sailors committed suicide last week on board USS George H. W. Bush - an American warship reported.
Over the last two years, five members of the crew have been killed.
Previous suicide took place in July of this year and earlier in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three Marines were shot last week.
Each event came to the ground when USS George H. W. Bush made his way to the coast of Virginia.
As so far, the participation of third parties has been excluded.
Moreover, death is not to be linked.
"It is necessary for everyone to engage in the presentation of suggestions and ideas on how we can prevent another suicide.
I would like to stress that there is no stigmatization or other repercussion related to the search for help," Captain Sean Bailey, captain of the ship, wrote on Facebook.
Nonviolently critical of the pope.
John Paul II did nothing
In his conversation with Piotr Lekszyck, Stefan Nisiolovski stressed that in 1981 John Paul II was a huge authority for opposition activists.
"Actually, each of his opinions has been accepted".
Later, some of his actions were criticized.
“For me, John Paul II has not been able to eliminate the harmful activity of Rydzika, and he has become a great shadow of his pontificate.
In fact, this Redemptorist – the pest of the Church and Poland – developed his media in the best way possible for the life of Pope Polaka," he explained.
Former PO politicians admitted: “There was a lack of satisfaction, the pope said something he had never accepted, but he had authority, and for politics he could simply expel him from the Church or send him to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor.
But John Paul II did not do so, like his successors," explained Nisiolovski.
“In addition, this fatal case of paedophilia and the activities of the Church came to an end, and they did not really exist.
I ran a little ahead of my mind, but I wanted to pay attention to the whole of his life.
We've known about the scale of paedophilia in the Church since recently.
There is a question as to how it is possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know these disgusting things," says Nisiolovski in a conversation with a journalist.
In the assessment of the former policy PO Polish Church is an ally of PiS.
“It must be admitted that during the period of Solidarity, the Church was our most important ally.
All the celebrations started with the sacred mouse, hanging crosses everywhere.
Now these crosses are written, they become a symbol of dictatorship – a sign of the written regime.
I repeat: one of the most unpleasant surprises is that such people as Riddick shake the Polish Church that John Paul II did nothing about it and that today the Church is an ally of PiS.
This is the black chapter of the Polish Church, for which it will come to pay for the oil," Nisiolovski said.
"I hope that Pope Francis will drive the Yūdraszewski, Rydzika and a few others of this type," he summed up.

PZPN's paying for burds at the stadiums.
Disqualified handle
The beginning of the Polish Pucharu between Griffe Wejherowo and Lechia Gdańsk with small hair did not end tragically when the Wejher Rac was fired by the Wejhers with millimetres past the opponent's brakes, Zlatana Alomerovica.
After that incident, the match was interrupted for 20 minutes.
The investigation carried out by the PZPN Commission on this case, and excluded Gryf from future play.
The club will not be able to start in the Polish Pucharza in the 2020/2021 season.
In addition, the kibbies will not be admitted to the nearest match at their own stadium.
They won't be able to go to the leagues until December 31st.
The Burds at the Vidzew Łódź stadium also caused the Ślęska Wrocław kibice.
Here, however, the PSC judgment was milder, for Slovakia predicted that similar events could occur and felt the appropriate authorities in this regard.
Nevertheless, the services have allowed the sector of boat kibitz to be depleted by cancer, fuelled chairs and forced into the economic sector.
This match was interrupted for eight minutes, and the intervention police had to use the watercraft.
PZPN punished Słąsk with a one-time stadium ban in the nearest match in Puchara Polski and prohibited the organisation of the matches in this and the subsequent issue of PP.
The ban also included the Extrakles leagues, but will last until 31 December.
Foreign names of cities on road signs also in Poland
DGDKiA plans to exchange labelling on the entire managed network of roads by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Raszów
The implementation of the new regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on e.g. the registration of foreign names of cities on road signs has begun in Subcarpathia, also after Poland.
For example, "Lwów" will appear next to "L'viv".
In our constituency, the changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear it, it's supposed to be easier, easier, easier and simpler.
The new guidelines result from the renewal of the Minister of Infrastructure Regulation on specific technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices.
"We should remember that the names of the localities in the neighbouring countries are also often Polish.
Thanks to the change in the law, they will finally appear on the roads along our roads.
The introduction of a new marking starts with the underground section of the A4 motorway," Andrzej Adamczyk, the Minister of Infrastructure, informed.
Undercarriage changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total investment cost?
200 grand.
In the first order, the new marking will be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is scheduled to take place before 1 November 2019.
What's the idea to look like?
He'll wake up without changing the tables, actually.
They will replace the existing locality names with new ones written in Polish on existing symbols.
Both names will be recorded in one row – in the first order after Poland, and then in the original, in the seal.
This will be a great relief for people who do not know the names of foreign cities in the country where they are located.

Someone shot the windshield in the windshield.
In the state of Castle in Lower Silesia, the inhabitants noticed a weakness with wing problems.
After catching and visiting the veterinarian, it turned out that someone had made his target from the animal – a straw found in his body from the windmill.
“The information on the injured bird was received from the residents of the village of the Centre for the Rehabilitation of Wild Animals in New Soli.
The report showed that the animal had broken wings.
We made it.
It's just that there's something wrong with him.
We acted quickly and precisely so as not to hurt him or put an extra stress on him.
The blade was caught and put into the vet.
After the first RTG shot, it was already known that someone had made himself a target.
There were fractures in his body," says Marcin Walasek, president of Malpol, managing the rehabilitation centre.
He's in the center.
"The wounds were cleaned, antibiotics were given to the bird, access to the water was provided, a safe place in the centre where it will spend the entire winter.
We're trying to strengthen him.
He can't fly right now.
The release would now be linked to the fact that he probably wouldn't survive the winter," Walasek adds.
The staff will release him in the spring after he has given in to a weakness of rehabilitation.
The authorities of the municipality of Žukowice, after receiving information on the cause of the animal health condition, intend to inform the prosecution.
There's been an incident in the locker.
Gowin: "We must encourage Polish, small trade"
"The effective taxation of supermarkets does not solve the problem of small trade, it will have to be wondered whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade," said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, leader of the Jarosław Gowin Agreement on Friday.
Gowin, during the "Signalling Day" talk in Radio One, said that trade is controlled by international networks that impose so low margins on Polish producers that Polish companies cannot actually develop.
In view of the fact that it is very difficult to deal with this problem, the Deputy Prime Minister recalled that the government of PiS tried to measure this at the very beginning of the term of office, but was given a "opportunity on the part of KE".
"We have won before the Court of Justice and I hope that if the United Justice wins the nearest elections and formulas of the government, we will return to this issue," he said.
At the same time, he noted that "effective taxation of supermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish and thus small trade".
"It will also have to be considered whether the government has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade," Gowin said.
In May, the EU court found that the European Commission had made a mistake in recognizing that Polish retail tax is not permitted by public aid.
The retail tax law imposed two trade tax rates: 0.8% of revenue between 17 million and 170 million dollars per month and 1.4% of revenue above 170 million dollars per month.
The tax was due from September 2016.
In September 2016, the KE initiated a procedure for violating EU law by Poland.
Brussels then argued that the tax structure could favour smaller shops, which could be regarded as public aid.
It then concluded that the tax was implemented in a manner which was incompatible with the law.
It also issued an order suspending the application of the tax until its analysis is completed by the officials in Brussels.
Poland did not agree with this position, but the tax collection was suspended.
The EU Court of Justice's May ruling opened the way for the reintroduction of tax, but did not end the case.
On 24 July, the Commission brought an appeal before the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the TEU Press Service informed the PAP that the case is currently at a written stage where both the European Commission and the Polish Government present their arguments in writing.
It is currently unknown whether or not the oral procedure, namely the hearing of the parties and the possible proceedings, is in progress.
It takes a good few to a few hundred months to bring an appeal to the court.
"This is the average year," said the PAP source at the Luxembourg Court.
How do you dress a child for baptism?
Summing up a few practical solutions
Baptism is an important celebration in the lives of the infant and his parents.
Often it is the first time a child is focused around the whole family, celebrating his or her appearance in the world.
It's no wonder, then, that freshly baked mom and dad want their comfort to look the best on this day.
However, before you make a final decision about your child’s machine, ask yourself whether it will be convenient as well.
Because in the shops you can find a lot of machine kits that do not provide minimal comfort.
So, what should we pay attention to?
The basic criterion of baptismal dress is the age of the child
Until recently, a few weeks later, small ones were baptized, dressed in white sets and inserted into the same beaks or large breaths.
Today, children attending the sacrament are often older: several months, years, and even older.
It's not hard to imagine that so much comfort needs something else to get baptized.
So if your child on the day of baptism has 3-4 months, it is likely that the ceremony will be in the cart or in the hands of parents or Christians.
The best way out will be to equip him with comfortable, cottony muscles or completes.
Although this wardrobe element is considered to be a daily garment, it is enough to search for its sacred variants, for example with a falbank or crown.
Ideal for a boy will be points with the impression of a muscle and a skeletal.
In the case of older children, you can afford to have a bigger imagination in your dress.
The girl will look beautiful in a simple, tight dress
Many parents of girls with fatigue look at the rich, falsified dress for the cross in a set of blankets, belts and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers are using plastic, non-respiratory materials in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
Looking for the appropriate clothing, you'd better look for Asanti for Kids shop, which offers elegant machines on cotton cushions.
The delicate, warm skirts, satin dresses, crowns, applications and charming sets make your daughter look beautiful and feel comfortable.
Ideal suit for a small gentleman: cotton suit
Until recently, the boys' parents have had a fashionable suit that is a copy of the "adult" models.
Polyester sailors and bottomless, stiff knees or caskets often caused young elegants to express their dissatisfaction.
Luckily, today they were made up by comfortable cotton sets.
Just look at the kits available in Asanti for Kids, i.e. soft, dress-up bottoms, and for this shirt decorated from the front to the model of the shirt.
These machines look extremely glorious, and at the same time they do not shrink the movements of the little world.
Kristina Pawlović published a statement of property
Kristina Pawlović made a statement of property at the end of her term of office.
As a result, the PiS envoy has gathered 110,000 bad savings.
Well, let's just remember that Pavlović ordered her to leave politics.
At the end of his term of office, he has an amount of 110 thousand zł
As a result of the statement made by the letter, it will retire at a monthly value of NOK 4.7 000.
Pavlovic has a apartment worth 570 thousand zł and a little smaller, which he rents, taking 880 zł per month.
The letter also invests in industrial metals, assessing the investment for 150,000 zł.
Earlier, the Maternity Statement was also published by Jarosław Kaczynski.
Vote on the break at the Conference of the Conservative Party
British parliamentarians voted against a three-day break in the Gmin Chamber during the annual program conference of the Conservative Party, which the government has called for.
289 apostles said so, against 306.
Normally, the Gmin House does not discuss at the conference so that the ambassadors do not have to give up their participation in it or in Parliament's meetings.
However, the opposition parties considered that, in such a key period of time as are the last weeks of Britain's departure from the European Union on 31 October, Parliament should not interrupt the debate.
At the Government's request for a break, 289 sent an appeal against 306.
Two opposition parties already after the conventions
The absence of a leave may be taken as a political revenge for the opposition of Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend Parliament for five weeks (on Tuesday the Supreme Court found it incompatible with the law and the former) and for not wanting to apologise for it after the judge's ruling.
After this decision, the Gmin Chamber resumed its Wednesday session, and the most important event of the day was the appearance of Johnson and the next lively debate after it.
Johnson called the opposition to block the Brexit and to avoid early elections.
"The time has come to realize Brexit.
It needs to be implemented to respect the outcome of the referendum.
Brexit must come so that we can deal with the priorities of citizens, the health service, the cost of living.
Brexit must be realized so that we can unite this country," Johnson said.
The Conservative Party Conference is scheduled to begin in Manchester on the following Sunday and will last until Wednesday, October 2.
The Conferences of the two main opposition groups – the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats – have already taken place.
One of the reasons Johnson gave for explaining this long suspension of parliament was precisely a party conference.
Media: Andrzej Duda charges Israel with anti-chemical attacks in Poland
"President Andrzej Duda believes that the anti-chemical attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-polic rhetoric of Israeli leaders," foreign media say.
The President's spokesman strongly detracted from these reports.
"It's just not true," he wrote on Twitter Blaži Spyhalski.
Israeli media such as "Haaretz" and "Jerusalem Post", referring to "Jewish Insider", say Andrzej Duda, when he met with representatives of the Jewish diaspora at the RP Consulate in New York, said that Israel was guilty of the last anti-chemical attacks in Poland.
The president said that the increase in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland is a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to the words of the Israeli Foreign Minister of Israel Katz, who stated in February that “Police sent anti-Semitism with milk of mothers”.
Andrej Duda said that he regretted Israel’s not apologizing for the humiliating statements of his politicians.
He also mentioned the act of aggression against the Polish ambassador to Israel by Mark Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by an attacker who shouted, "Polek, Polak".
"The quote is not only incorrect.
It's just not true," he wrote on Twitter.
He stressed that the Duda “never said that Israel was responsible for the last anti-chemical attacks in Poland”.
According to the Emergency Portal, "this is what he invented."
According to "JI" speakers at the meeting, there was also a dispute between the Holocaust survivors, marked by the Cross of the Order of Merit RP Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was going to agree with President Dudy's words and say that Jews from Israel are "like Israel Kac" responsible for the growth of anti-Semitism.
According to the sources of the Boteach portal, he was going to interrupt Mosberg's story.
Who's Banas and what's he guilty of?
Rented by the stonekeepers led the journalist to discover the negligence in Marian Banasi's statements of property.
We're summarizing another affair that has shaken the governor's camp.
TVN reporters have announced that Marian Banas, the president of the Supreme Court of Control, has not been writing down a 400-metre property statement that is located on the Krakow Podgorz in recent years.
Moreover, his tenant had sex business in the mentioned stone (so to rent rooms for hours).
In turn, the building itself has been known to have secured the payment of the credit since 2016.
Bertold Kittel made a mistake in the Supervision program.
The journalist found that the stone was rented from Banasis by people associated with the criminal world to use it as a place of "erotic meetings".
Clients were supposed to be men using the services of prostitutes.
Banas responded in a vague and vague manner to the charges.
Interestingly, the tenants hired the stonekeepers led the journalist to discover the negligence in Banasi's statements of property.
The stone itself was described in them because it was unclear, and the income from her rent was to be reduced.
“The estate of Marian Banasis and his wife can be worth between $6 million and $8 million.
In sum, husbands can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings[...]", writes Money.pl.
And as a result of the portal analysis, Banasi's own stone worth about $3 million was already worth it.
The Central Anti-Corruption Office currently controls Marian Banasi's property statements for the years 2015–2019.
Banas said he'd hang his business in NIK by the time it was finished. "I'll go out with you for a free vacation," he said.
The opposition is asking for clarification.
“We do not hear that the CBA has expanded its investigation or accelerated the investigation of Marian Banasi’s claims.
That is why we are forced to hand over state authorities and notify us of the possibility of committing a crime [...]," said Ambassador PO-KO Mariusz Witczak.
"If the normal Polak had so highly underestimated the renting of its property, he would already have had 10 controls, tax havens and tax-free conduct," he added.
He went up high, fell low
Marian Banas is the new president of the Supreme Court of Control.
This post was opened on 30 August 2019 for a term of office of 6 years.
His candidacy was declared by the Justice and Justice and the political votes of the party.
Earlier Banas was associated with NIK in 1992-2005, acting as a co-worker of Lech Kaczynski.
During the first PiS governments (2005-2008), Banas held the position of President of the Customs Service and also the Under-Secretary of State of the Ministry of Finance.
Since 2015, he has again sat at the head of the Customs Service and has managed the National Treasury Administration since 2017.
For three months, Banas served as the finance minister of the government of Mateus Morawiecki.
Cooler Master introduces catch for graphics cards on the market
The graphics cards can now really weigh a lot, which naturally makes room for a category of products that would be empty to look for in the store half a decade ago.
This is the solution – capture for the ELV8 RGB graphics card – presented Cooler Master.
The new graphics card capture model is not only a functional solution that allows you to keep your graphics card safe without depending on the strength of the PCI-express slot.
Cooler Master ELV8 RGB also has an additional task – decorative.
"Rzeczpospolita": Ignoring the police command will be punished
According to the newspaper, disregard of a particular order of conduct issued by the police officer is to be a new kind of offence, threatened by a criminal, arrest or restriction of liberty.
The introduction of such a change is what the police allies want.
The idea came to the Commission for Petitions.
"The matter is serious, because now every year more than half a million outlaws are brought before the Polish courts," we read.
The "Rechpospolita" found that the petition, which the Independent Police Trade Union writes to the ambassadors on the amendment of the Code of Offences, is likely to be successful.
The authors of the petition propose a new wording of Article 54a of the Code of Infringements.
It should read: ‘Any person who does not comply with the request or order of a public official, issued within the limits and under the law, shall be subject to the penalty of arrest, criminality or restriction of liberty’.
‘Par. 3 of this provision speaks of the same punishment for those who do not carry out orders, are unable or difficult to carry out the service activity,’ the newspaper said.
Socijolog Andrzej Kowalski said "Rzeczpopolitje", that although he agreed with the main transmission of the proposal for a regulation, he feared that if implemented, it could be used in political demonstrations.
"In the situations of freedom demonstrations, it would be a disadvantage and rather to ease the situation, rather than to make it more difficult," he adds.
According to the statistics provided by the newspaper, 86% of citizens had a positive evaluation of police interventions in 2018 and 1.5 million city interventions were undertaken every month by the services.
The Bureau is concerned about Europe
My Topol writing is in the blood.
Among his predecessors are editors, translators, writers.
Father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important armed Czech dramatists, mentioned today in one row with Václav Havl.
Thus, from the beginning, the curse of the talent that he was trying to use was hanging on to Jahim.
After eight years he came back with a "sensitive man".
The heroes are Buras and Sonja, along with two sons, who do not create a typical Czech family.
They're marine actors, they're traveling across Europe.
He's a lover of Shakespeare and a thief, she's a single-eyed translator who doesn't break up with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys from birth didn't make a sound, and the other boy stopped at the baby's time.
But they're not heroes, they're the most important thing in this story.
Everyone is just a background for observing a world where there's no room for artists anymore.
It's a world of troubled provinces, societies of old, suspicious people and soluble youth.
"Vulnerable man" places turn into an absurd theater.
Narracy imitates the didascals, and the conversations of heroes create this world.
The scene is Europe's full concern about its future, but also constant questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancelled 105 flights due to bankruptcy Thomas Cook
Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook has fallen, his Belgian daughter Neckermann works.
However, the company has problems.
According to VRT TV, Brussels Airlines announced that they are cancelling 105 flights in October due to bankruptcy problems with Thomas Cook.
Neckermann also fired 75 employees.
All departures with the office that have been reserved in Belgium will be cancelled, but in time they will be able to receive a refund.
The Gandawi court also announced the fall of three Belgian subsidiaries: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently about 12,000 Belgians are staying abroad on departures purchased at Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were supposed to leave with the office by the end of the year.
On Monday, lawyer Thomas Cook Belgium Leen Segers said that the company is currently "fully operational" despite the announcement of bankruptcy by the British company of a mother who caused anxiety among employees and customers.
The office then calmed down that the customers who bought the trip in it would go on vacation.
Thomas Cook – the oldest and one of the world’s largest travel offices – announced a fall on Sunday night.
The direct cause of bankruptcy was to break into Sunday's last chance talks with creditors and potential investors.
The creditors claimed that, in addition to the already agreed rescue plan worth 900 million pounds, the company gained an additional 200 million as a security for the winter period when the travel office usually has lower turnovers.
However, the company's problems have grown for several years, which has resulted in a debt of £1.6 billion.

That's what we played very weak.

Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for your review
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an extraordinary offer has been prepared for German arrivals.
Activities are designed to help combat the continuing decline of the city’s population.
Görlitz is the most remote city in East Germany.
A beautiful pastel shop attracts 140 thousand tourists a year.
However, according to The Guardian, the city is faced with significant problems.
There are the lowest wages in Germany in Görlitz.
The city also competes with a steady decline in population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them left for the west of the country, moving to a 25% decline in the city’s population.
In 2013, it accounted for 54,000 people.
To fight the population, officials came up with the idea of starting to offer free monthly accommodation in the city.
Until 150 applications were made.
Two thirds of them were the inhabitants of large cities.
The program also interested people from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom.
"When we applied, we thought that the program should convince people to move to Görlitz," one of the project participants said.
"We now feel that it doesn't matter whether we stay here after four weeks or not," he added.
The city has seven thousand free homes, and unemployment is three times higher than the average across the country.
While the city authorities hope that some will take place on a permanent basis, the main objective of the programme is to obtain an opinion from the programme participants.
The information collected from the interviews and questionnaires is intended to help revive smaller German cities.
"We want to learn more about what people need, and if they decide to move – what their motivation was," said Robert Knippschild.
Other cities have already experimented with the idea of attracting new residents, offering them encouragement in the form of accommodation.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a payment program promising young specialists for life and work in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy or in the U.S. Tulsa in Oklahoma.
