Inflation in Europe has slowed down on food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
In November, price increases in the 13 euro area countries were more important than expected, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded, indicated the European Community statistical office in Luxembourg.
The official forecasts indicated only 3 per cent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the principal interest rate by saying that the decrease in interest, with the rise in raw materials prices and the fall in unemployment rate, would lead to the generation of an inflationist spiral.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below but close to two percent.
According to an analyst, it is the Catch 22 for the ECB: "inflation must be deterred" in order to no longer have to intervene on this subject later.
In Germany, the rate of inflation of 3.3 percent is a record in the last 12 years and in Spain, it ranges from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has declined due to the rapid increase in food and energy prices.
Cereal market shares have increased by 88% and soybean prices have also reached their highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products has also increased considerably in 2007.
This year, the global oil price increased by 52 per cent and, last month, a black gold barrel cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, the inflation rate in 2008 will be 2.1 this year, at 2.5 percent, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 percent, however, over the next 3-4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to reduce the management rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of Fidesz (The Alliance of Young Democrats) has increased significantly in early December. Thus since 2002, it currently has the largest number of participants, while Gallup (Institut de Investigation) has never seen such low socialist support before, i.e. 13 percent.
For the faithful electors, the difference would be, due to the greatest determination of the opposition voters, more than two thirds (71 per cent) of support against the support of a fifth (20 per cent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the survey, the MDF (Hungary Democrat Forum) and the SZDSZ (Free Democrats Alliance) are below the parliamentary threshold: their support is two percent throughout the population.
Of the faithful voters, some vote, the number of participants in the two parties increased by 1 per cent.
The economic climate continued to deteriorate from the lowest point of view, the proportion of those who thought that the country's economic situation was particularly severe has never been so high, it rose to 41 per cent and, according to 46 per cent, the situation was rather serious.
After the most optimistic perspectives in spring and summer, families are once again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For the next year, the majority of the population is expected to see an increase and only one tenth is expected to see an improvement in the situation.
Last December, 71 per cent of the surveyed, namely a majority never seen in Gallup's previous polls, thought that the prime minister was doing his job rather than good.
13 per cent of the investigators have confidence or much confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while 38 per cent support Viktor Orbán.
54 per cent do not fully trust the Prime Minister and 27 per cent trust the President of Fidesz.
One indicator of the change in the political situation is the proportion of society thinking that the unhappiness towards the Prime Minister can be dealt with without change in government.
While 35 per cent of respondents wanted the government and the Prime Minister to remain in office after the October summits, the rate is currently only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) believes that the holding of new elections would be the solution to this situation.
On the question of the intention to vote, 60 per cent of the respondents replied that they would certainly vote and the 20 per cent additional said that they would probably vote.
To compare, for a "legislative election to organize next Sunday", only 55 per cent of the polls would certainly participate and 15 per cent would probably participate. Following current intentions, the outcome of the referendum would have no doubt.
74 per cent of people would say no to enrollment rights in higher education, 79 per cent would say no to consultation costs and 84 per cent would say no to hospital stay costs.
When we look at only the same proportions among those who have expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of the voters, respectively, would reject the introduction of registration rights, consultation costs and hospital stay costs.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by almost 20 percent
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trade triangle maintained the average price increase of 16 percent last year compared to the difference that the VAT rate did not increase this year.
Article of Napi Kasság (Daily Economy)
This year, in the Budaörs trade triangle, the usual Christmas Cart has also increased by 16 percent on average, a significantly higher value than a thousand forints were displayed in all supermarkets.
The prices, "which had already flown" in the large food stores last December, have no longer increased sharply compared to the previous high base.
However, consumers are obviously shocked to see that the items purchased clearly below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The Daily Cart in the surveyed hypermarkets exceeded 91 forints at least the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forints.)
The prices of Unicum and living fish remained almost at last year's level, but the prices of Dinnet, Noise and Pavot increased greatly.
In stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, in Auchan, only 139 forints were found.
Competition did not reduce the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was surprising to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of two litres of Coca-Cola bottle was below 200 forints, so it only cost 257 forints the bottle included.
It prevents that this year, in terms of Daily Cart, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the least expensive.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of its Daily Cart by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased it by about 18 and 18 percent respectively.
By comparing the most expensive basket last year and the least expensive basket this year, we see a 12 percent gap, while the difference between the least expensive last year and the most expensive of this year is 21 percent.
Prices increased by 1,480 forints on average.
Last year, prices increased by 1,206 forints on average, while the impact of the increase in VAT rates was already seen in last year's Christmas prices.
This process made trade perplexing, hypermarketers could not clearly determine the margin to be applied to products as long as they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, he may lose a significant profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
As a result of the change in VAT rate, the price increase in the Daily Cart has evolved in such a way that the most expensive basket was more than 1,720 forks than the value of 2006 while the difference between the least expensive baskets was only 844 forks.
This year, the difference was not too high as the value of the most expensive basket was more than 1,630 forts than that of the previous year and the prices of at least 1,284 forts also increased.
By approaching the two Christmas seasons, we have found a catastrophic price increase, in less than 20 months the prices of daily consumer goods have increased by more than 30 percent in supermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH data: for some of the first-necessary feeds, the Institute of Statistics has found an increase in prices of more than 30 percent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, of flour and eggs.)
According to the Daily Cart, this seems almost absurd as the price level of this product, already expensive last year, has increased by just over 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the indicators, flour suppliers occupy a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have been able to accept the brutal increase in prices also by multinationals.
In the commercial gold triangle, the hypermarketers do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experience, most customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarket visits.
They buy everything, they take long-term food with pallets.
On Wednesday morning, important tails formed into the boxes of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, the number of businesses is less important in the province, many multinationals complain to survey companies that they do not even reach the expected number of businesses, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Many hospitals are saving on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by the improper use of antibiotics, have been recorded in hospitals.
Hospital health conditions, insufficient number of beds, overcrowding of medical personnel do not help prevent infections, says the chief physician of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
Many hospitals also make savings on disinfectants
There was not long before an MRSA infection was diagnosed at the János Hospital's traumatology service.
The antibiotic-resistant bacteria were detected on a hospitalized man following a serious accident.
The disease has been isolated.
At the beginning of the year, a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injury from a serious car accident came out of the hospital but soon after it had returned due to an MRSA infection and, since then, doctors have not been able to perform an important operation because of the bacteria in its body.
Until 10 December this year, 1,094 hospital infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen have been reported to the National Nosocomial Monitoring System, said Karolina Böröcz, a physician at the National Epidemiology Centre.
To know that it is the number of infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen that has actually been registered in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
Approximately two thirds of infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSAs, otherwise said by aurous staphylococcus resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
One third of the people are carriers of the Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their nose without developing a disease.
Infections caused by SAs (such as angina, amygdality, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily treatable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacteria, which react well to antibiotics, will develop a highly resistant bacteria to antibiotics that will spread rapidly under poor hospital conditions.
In the event of temporary or prolonged immunosuppression, this bacteria may cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or septicaemia, on the elderly, small weights or with a weak body.
According to the hospital director János, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily hospital.
Especially should the infection not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is not only found or not sought, said Tibor Nyulasi.
The SAs are resistant to antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, the personnel who care put rubber gloves and protective masks and we have suitable antibiotics to care for them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they are carriers of MRSA, but infection cannot always be avoided.
Sample sampling is not in mode
The vast majority of infections caused by MRSAs could be prevented, but the current conditions and circumstances are not favourable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs especially in hospitals and residences for elderly people, hospitals should control hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients with MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not finance these reviews.
Most cases see only if MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, the physician at the head of the epidemiological center said.
The European Union has strong recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts should be made to target antibiotic therapy, in other words microbiological examinations should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
Microbiological sampling is even more rare in outpatient and basic care, Karolina Böröcz reported.
Many hospitals are saving on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSAs spread from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash hands, put gloves and protective masks. However, important gaps are detected in hospitals in this area too.
MRSAs proliferate by infection transmitted by inhalation of drops and contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close to each other, while in the course of the epidemic, the patients should be removed from each other at least 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, we also find that hospitals, in a difficult financial situation, make savings on disinfectants, they lack nurses, the sick are numerous, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is less demonstrable or then the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbitant costs for social security funds, which is why we are fighting this infection everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a programme to prevent or reduce the impact of MRSAs.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) shows among its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multi-resistant pathogens (as well as MRSAs) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The Commissioner, who was responsible for a fatal accident, was not in a state of urgency.
The official statement on the fatal accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd District was drawn up.
It may be excluded that the Commissioner of the 22nd District, who has been resigning his post since, who broke a pawn by causing his death on Tuesday, would have led to an ivorish or austerity, communicated on Friday Attila Morvai, a spokesperson of the Ministry of the Public Capital after the relative finding was established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation that the former commissioner had already found that he had not consumed alcohol before taking the wheel
Last Tuesday, the former head of the 22nd District Commission broke up with a 55-year-old man who was facing him when he, with his personal car, went to the 22nd District Kossuth Lajos Street.
(On the other hand, the fact that he was crossing the road outside the pedestrian crossing does not constitute an attenuating circumstance, according to the Road Code a car that starts a turn must let the pedestrians pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
As a result of this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his position and requested his retirement because, according to the police report, he was greatly disturbed by the accident.
The investigation into this case is carried out by the Budapest Investigation Parquet.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former commissioner had cooperated from the outset with the magistrates responsible for conducting the investigation.
EUR 400 million additional for infrastructure
János Veres, Hungarian Finance Minister, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three agreements in Budapest on Friday with a total value of EUR 400 million on a credit line to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environmental projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, which has already been signed by the parties for a credit agreement of EUR 100 million.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement also covers the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB approved a total amount of EUR 300 million for Hungary and the remaining EUR 150 million could be used later following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties have signed a 50 million-euro contract for innovation, the state budget will primarily use this envelope as part of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the Metro Line 4 project was also addressed.
The parties agreed that they would rediscover the possible modification of the original contract when Hungary has completed the details of the metro financing with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has granted a total of EUR 8.4 billion to finance 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its appropriations according to the interest rate related to EURIBOR, with a period of 8 years and without a commitment commission.
Bulgaria, EU real estate market paradise
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, and the attention of the whole of Europe is drawn to this country of the Balkans, which is little mentioned in the past.
What, or who buys on this EU market, which is always the least expensive but which will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max division.
Currently, in the real estate, Bulgaria is unquestionably the most vague target of Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and houses on board the good sea.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovic, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, on the seashore, Albana, the "Golden Sables", the "Cote du Sun", the former Sozopol and Nessebar, but they are increasingly looking for a building in the region of Kavarna and Balcik as well.
According to Re/Max Bulgarian analysts, sooner or later, the country's central region, Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also generate the interest of investors and they are also increasingly buying in the very low cost of Russia.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, trade and office surfaces promise the highest depreciation rate.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of Europe's most attractive golf courses and thus to be a priority destination, after the summer and winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors are already buying large numbers, for example in the Bansko area.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria are at the same time trying to change their lives, their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English but others arrive from France, Belgium, Spain and Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On board the Black Sea and in the most famous ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who intend to install new buildings buy new buildings, at a price ranging from EUR 50 to EUR 100 thousand, or old houses devolved, at a price ranging from EUR 5 to EUR 15 thousand, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication opportunities, the proximity of a large city, shops and in general that of the local doctor.
The second group includes secondary residence buyers (since December, Bulgaria has been listed among the 10 first holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is composed of commercial investors who purchase in the hope of achieving a higher value in the medium or long term.
The price of capital buildings is increasing steadily as a result of an ever-increasing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the last five years they have increased by 21 percent each year.
The increase in real estate prices is mainly higher than the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarian
According to Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, the meeting of professionals ends on Tuesday, however, on Wednesday, after official opening, the ministers' negotiations on the post-2012 international climate regime will continue.
Experts and political men from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Road Sheet to define the efforts to be made after the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At this point, lively discussions are being held between developing countries and developed countries.
The United States also noted that, for the time being, they did not wish to discuss exact figures, but were prepared to sign an agreement on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from 25 to 40 per cent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries are committed, without emission reduction, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also signed on aid to developing countries.
The assistance fund as defined in the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a 16-member board, probably within the framework of the United Nations Global Environment Facility (GEF), Piac es Profit (Market and Profit) reported.
Six per cent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, reaffirms the EU's ambition to retain its role as admiral vessel in global efforts to protect the climate and to encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 compared to the level reached in 1990, regardless of the success of the signing of the Post-2012 Agreement, and was prepared to reduce them to 30 per cent if other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also prepared to make commitments tailored to their responsibilities and capacities.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the signatory countries of the Kyoto Protocol had a total reduction of 5.2 per cent and all 15 EU members of that time had made their commitment of 8 per cent in less.
Hungary has undertaken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to the level of the period 1985-87, our country will fulfil its commitment, recalls the Ministry of the Environment press release.
The issue is big in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy must be implemented within the two-year period, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be postponed after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments below the values provided for in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed immediately by a new international emission reduction system whose need was highlighted in the new IPCC report, the international scientific body, which has obtained the Nobel Peace Prize, which is responsible for climate change.
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and an increase in the Earth's average temperature of more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
British Army Recruited on YouTube
British Army units communicate on the video sharing site records made during their operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in order to become popular.
First, it is the British Air Force (RAF) that has been passionate about YouTube: the special units involved in Afghanistan have uploaded video footage on Taliban operations since March 2006, the BBC announced.
These recordings, with the help of miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are controlled at the general headquarters of operations of the Air Force in Kandahar and are then transferred to London or the compatriots to the Internet.
The political message is indispensable
Air Force soldiers have already passed 139 sequences on the net through this route and their "chain" has been seen by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as "defenceheadquarterers" in spring 2007 and broadcasts videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Commonwealth Office and the international peacekeeping forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own channels on YouTube.
Mission in Afghanistan
According to the original Air Force objective, the videos were conducted online to recruit, and according to the Ministry of Defence, they were also used to make public the actual objectives of the presence of the army abroad.
Propaganda published by this route cost practically nothing compared to the usual TV recruitment ads, as reported to BBC Gordon Mackenzie, a defence consultant, but it also inevitably carries a political message as it is in a special form justifying the well-founded military operations decided by the government.
The Americans have made a game
The army is obsessed because, in addition to carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos are passed on the sharing site that also feature, for example, the death of soldiers: in "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, officers do not avoid talking about losses but they never present the bloody side of the fight.
In addition, many of the videos were already on the net presenting the operational areas in Iraq and Afghanistan that were carried out in a real mission, but the British army is only packing for the loading of these videos for a short time.
Americans do the recruitment a little differently by using the American's Army shooting game for free. In this game the player can directly replace the soldiers as part of a more or less real simulation.
Christmas tombola and kisses in the ministries
Monika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold an end-of-year meeting with her employees who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 by taking beigets and coffee.
Another department will organize a live music party, another will enthrall officials with a tombola and offer a glass to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffets, so enjoy the power.
The public authorities are also preparing Christmas.
This year, the biggest Christmas celebration will be organized by the Ministry of Defence, but it is not the employees of the Ministry who will be invited.
In Christmas, the Orphans, the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for the Missionary Christmas, the family members of the soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The Department provides for a budget of 25 million forts to create the end-of-year environment.
Compared with other departments, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economics and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM festival will be held in the Future House with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, of the six hundred employees in large, three hundred and fifty are expected.
During this celebration, the Christmas atmosphere will be strict, there will be actors and also a tombola.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was organized on Wednesday in the National Council of Justice (ILO) building with concerts and dinner.
The rental of the hall cost one million forints, the rest spent for more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a NFÜ service is invited to another Christmas party that is organised with European money by the National Centre for Economic Development, the company manager of calls for tenders.
The building of the Teatre de la Gaîté was rented for these purposes.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt as we have failed to contact the responsible.
The costume is not mandatory
The ILO building not only hosted the NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and the Police, who, instead of a Christmas celebration, organized a ball on the occasion of St. Luca's Day on 7 December.
The ILO did not make them pay for the use of its rooms.
That ball had five hundred people.
The party began with the Minister's welcome words and the dinner was followed by a dance evening on live music.
Answer to the [origo] question: the evening was not at all mandatory for this ball.
Departments of Health, Labour and Local Communities are preparing an over-the-counter festival.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a festival for its employees, in its walls, for 400,000 forints.
Monika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not officially invite her employees to a Christmas party but to an end-of-year work meeting.
One hundred and twenty-four people are expected to be invited to take a coffee and have a snack, the press service announced, the festival will not cost as much as 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Communities, will simply invite his employees to take a glass in the Ministry of Local Communities and territorial planning room.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organize a Christmas celebration in its large room where 436 employees are expected.
He spends 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a glass.
Since the arrival of János Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas each year in the same way.
No expected holiday atmosphere, the official character is strengthened not only by the Minister's presentation but also by the time of the festival that takes place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will host a reception on January 20th to celebrate the new year, and Christmas will not take place.
The reception will be held at the castle of Vajdahunyad, located in the City Woods, and according to the department's communication, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for hundreds of guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are started with a few words of welcome from the Minister following a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture are not celebrating Christmas at all, they have communicated their respective press services to [origo].
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the festival at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the strike are gathering
The League's trade unions and the National Association of Workers' Councils will be their strike commission on Friday, which will be responsible for coordinating the strike for an indefinite period of Monday.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and Monday, the strike will begin on the day of the final vote on the Health Box Act.
This action will certainly lead to major loopholes in traffic as rail traffic will be almost completely stopped and BKV employees (common transport company) will also strike up to 1 p.m.
The League's trade unions will inform on Friday afternoon of the details of their strike on Monday, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The LIGA-MOSZ strike commission will also be established and will serve as coordinator for Monday's actions.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and from Monday, organizations joining the strike will stop work for an indefinite period if they do not reach agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in Parliament on the Health Box Act, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the Health Box Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the appeal to the strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike commissions will meet and decide to proceed.
According to the Monday agenda of the National Assembly, it is likely that the vote on the Health Boxes Act will take place only late at night or at night.
Because of the strike planned for Monday, important noises are foreseen in traffic: railways will stop work for an indefinite period and during the morning a part of the joint transport in Budapest and more than half of Volán companies may be arrested.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half of the road will also be blocked.
Many unions and civil organizations have joined the strike call, and the list of these is kept up to date on the League's website.
Some organizations report strike for an indefinite period of time; others reported temporary work arrest.
Until Thursday afternoon, the MÁV (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Trade Union (VDSZZSZZ) have not been able to reach agreement on minimum services, gold, in the Christmas approaches, more and more are taking the train.
According to current communications, the public transport in Budapest will strike from the start of service to 1 p.m., the Budapest Airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the Industrial Trade Unions of Electricity and Thermal Energy of the League will strike for four hours, the Professors' Union and the Professors' Democratic Union have called for strike for 2 hours and 2 to 8 hours respectively.
The National Association of Doctors will strike all over the country in an alternative manner, the Health and Social Employees Union (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will strike a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four claims, made by the League, requires the Government to withdraw its proposal on health reform and to submit a new concept to the social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculating retirement to be introduced from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third claim seeks a guarantee, in the case of retirement before the legal age, that would allow the functions that deserve it to be transferred into the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Trade Union (VDSZZSZ) of the League's trade unions, the proposal of the Ministry of Economics and Transport concerning secondary railway lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard has increased the risk of countries
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, formed last August, with the support of the Jobbik Magyarszágért Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary) increase, in several respects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its "risk warning", the company notes that, in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that "in the short term, aggressive ethnic confrontations can occur as a result of the exacerbation of the already existing ethnic tension between the gypsy and non-gypsy population of Hungary".
The research institute added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy that is likely to cause this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: "public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma affair to representatives of the radical and extreme political groups that have based a political strategy on the dispute between the Tzigans and the Hungarians."
The problem is compounded, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists see themselves strengthened, and the arrival of aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, under the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media, the activities of the Hungarian Guard "has significantly deteriorated Hungary's image abroad, particularly as regards confidence in the country's stability and democratic maturity".
They recall that, as a result of a greater publicity given to the reorganization of the Hungarian radical and extreme right groups since autumn 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007 as the "National Self-Defense Association".
"The common theme of these meetings is that they define themselves as a civil organization while publicly declaring the preparation of their adherents for defence missions (disasters, national defence, order defence), armed if necessary, to go beyond, referring to the incapacitity of the police, the army, in other words, of the state," they added.
They noted that everything was done in accordance with the method that, based on the resentment of political society and parties, seeks to drive out different political ambitions in a civil way.
The emphasis on the civil character and status of association is therefore only to avoid legal traps of registering such associations in court, but they are also a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activities of the Hungarian Guard are a factor that also increases the risk of neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk, and the ultra-nationalist political actors from certain border countries want to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the Hungarian Guard's constitution.
This affects the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, political risks have increased across the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard, for example, is similar to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The many disturbances of Rome that broke out in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are the origins of the constitution of the Bulgarian Guard.
Taking advantage of these events, UNB has decided to form a guard saying that the organization's goal is "national self-defence".
According to them, in the last 17 years, the gypsies have "terrorized" Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had sparked lively debates in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations on the establishment of their own resistance guard indicates an increase in the risk of ethnic confrontations.
The functioning of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not preclude the Hungarian Roma from reacting to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defence, can be read in the policy capital risk warning.
Attila Juhász, Research Director of Political Capital, at the request of the telegraphic agency, said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the Research Institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published every year and if events occur that could have an impact on the change in risk, they inform the public as in the present case by issuing a risk warning.
The party is not marked everywhere in red
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the holidays and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganize the working days whose number will decrease next year.
Feasts are no longer uniform in the EU and the United States.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes national and state holidays as well as rest days.
Rest days are often linked to religious festivals or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year that ends, and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, so much more so that the wake-ups can rest quietly.
In addition, in one year, we have 11 parties marked red.
March 15 is a national celebration, commemorating the 1848 revolution, as well as October 23 which is the commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On 20 August, we celebrate the constitution of our state, on 1 May is the festival of work, and on 1 and 2 November, we remember members of our family and friends who died.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, at Pentecost and at Christmas.
The days of our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, according to the calendar, have become common to reorganize working days in cases or only one working day remains before or after the day marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of extended weekends by working or going to school on Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has established a special regulation on the days of replacement of the previous days or after the holidays.
The Act extends to all employers and all their employees, employees and persons working in the public service.
It does not, however, apply to service companies, institutions that work without interruption and in service, by their vocation, and also to rest days.
This year, working days will only be changed around the end of the year: from 24 December, life stops almost all over the country because according to experience, the majority of people do extra hours or take holidays they have saved for these purposes in order to spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at home.
The following year many parties fall in the middle or at the end of the week, therefore there will be less changes at the level of working days compared to this year.
The calendar will be reorganized for the first time around the work party to allow employees to stay at their home for four days.
Saturday, April 25, will be a working day to have a rest day on Friday, May 2.
Another change is scheduled for 23 October: Saturday 18 October will be a working day replacing Friday 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the holidays, as from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if the new year's day falls on a Wednesday.
Six Fragile Things That Can Be Terrible to Fellow Members
Emails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that almost give us more: these are things that "beautiful" every day at a place of work.
The question is whether we are accustomed to these nuisances or we face the challenge and deliberately avoid the ambiguity of situations, causing other people to be bored.
Examples.
"Excuse me, I forgot to tell you you were called the marketing service," said one of your colleagues.
Did you miss a date?
He is best sorry and tries to arrange things by calling the marketing service to tell them that he forgot to pass the message (this is the most common solution).
In most cases, the thing is arranged with excuses.
Before you have painful explanations, it is helpful to consider how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
Do you borrow anything that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, a desk tool or the phone and you can't find anywhere.
Do you remember the guard you put the graffiti on the desk but she disappeared the next morning?
You happen to find your style that you thought was lost on your colleague's office?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking them if they're right to be angry with you for hurting their property.
It doesn't carry envelopes, it's mail in your pocket because it can be annoying that there's no more and that you need them right away.
You're a pawn of colleagues' private life?
There are no good ways to stop poppy that spread.
Who did what, with whom?
Or why?
Don't tell everyone about your colleagues' privacy information!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, don't abuse his trust!
bury the information in you and do not discuss it with your colleagues in your absence, even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
Are you saying you're sick for no reason?
When you call the office and you say you're sick because you feel sick or you think you need some rest that day, think about the fact that your work, your urgent business, your final missions have to be done by someone else in your place.
Don't make fun of your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you will not work or that something might happen that would make you stay home, do not forget to warn your boss and your colleagues to avoid being surprised by your absence the next day.
Cooling, reclamation, telephone
You're drowning in your work, but the ridicule of your colleagues is brutal?
Did you become a witness to a phone conversation you'd rather not listen to?
Do not disturb your colleagues with colds, cantonations, loud discussions (which you carry above their heads), beatings of feet, big words or loud voice discontents.
They may interfere even if your colleagues are not involved in a project (editation, design, organization).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
If your work is not done for the fixed time, you forget to send a mail or an important message, don't blame anyone for this!
Don't put it on account of any chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize him if you've made a mistake and if it has presented some disadvantages to others, fix the mistake!
Ask how you could fix your mistake, fix your neglect!
You feel too much at your office?
Puting a jogging and shoes is comfortable at home but they don't fit in the office!
Do not put comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Don't be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your function requires it by wearing beautiful and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to answer the expectations, you're not interested anymore.
We move slowly in the usual morning.
Suddenly, a special melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a cell to which electronic effects are associated.
I've got the sound.
The music changes by rhythm and the bass arrives to accompany the tones all the time, then a female choral comes to join it as a real jewel.
Mr2 spread the song Wings of Love from Zagar.
Hungarian musical life has not spent much time with a good-quality electronic pop.
Now, it seems that the bouquet becomes different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born of the Hungarian digital underground are beginning to gradually change the overall image and, despite the new mode of the garage rock decoupling the guitar, the Hungarian electrotrope proves that there is a new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer came from Pécs and he was playing himself in the Yonderboi group before he started on his own path, perhaps because "there is no room for two feet in the same shoe".
His project (Zagar) and his music, a jazz ally, electronic dancing and pop music, began to become known when he was entrusted with the composition of filmed soundtracks (e.g.
The season of Ferenc Török).
The training at the beginning of small clubs began to be known by a larger audience when the wan2 magazine quoted their first album of 2002 among the 50 most important albums of the Hungarian market and proclaimed by Zagar, with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend that would also compete in the West.
Zagar and his whole became unmistakably trendy, but no one asked them if they wanted to wear this label.
The group responded as needed, came out a new and better disc.
The album entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, released recently, can open new paths for them, although the title wants to represent continuity with the past years in Pécs.
It was a line from the old group of Pécs de Balázs Zságer.
We are there well with the reference to the flight but beside the air music now appears, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the strongest guitar, impact of the rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with The Puzzle group, showed his talent in these songs during the first album in the Millennium Park.
On the album, a real tube for the radio, Mr.2 Petõfi, which has been broadcasting popular music from morning to evening, began to introduce the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("underground Divas").
It's all right, then.
hvg.hu asked questions at Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new tube prompts me to ask a question: is your music still a music for a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term of music aimed at a certain layer does not say much to me.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop, but commercial music and sincere music.
The music itself saying alternatives, underground can also be medium and made only for sale and become commercial.
However, a good pop song can also be sincere.
The attitude of reception also works in this spirit regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungarian public and foreigners, is one or the other more open to your music?
Zs.B.: On the other hand, especially in the west, light music has older traditions.
On the other hand, people go to concerts, not only young people in their mid-twenties, but also older ones.
They follow with much more attention the changes in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, and how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I am obviously glad to see more and more people coming to our concerts.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us, music is not made to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important to concerts or mutual influence already works, but it is perceived only in the immeasurable changes of the moment.
But I noticed that if you wanted to answer the public's expectations, you wouldn't be interested anymore.
hvg.hu: Do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He's working alone and he's got a career in the West.
Zs.B.: We don't really follow his path even though some people sometimes try to find traces in our music.
Instead, we are team players who have confidence in the musical presence of the other and let it unfold.
At first, it was inevitable that our music would be compared to that of Yonderboi because we are several to leave his group and take another path.
hvg.hu: On Mr2 Petõfi's palmarès, Wings of Love takes the first place.
Many are those who have heard the name Zagar for the first time by the way of this song.
With this more popular style, did you deliberately open up to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't plan to make a tube to sell the disk.
This song means more.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to soften the sound orgy and the most difficult themes on the whole disk.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why did they - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel-like choral.
We had the idea to compose this choral of good soloists from the Hungarian musical scene.
The choir was composed of six members, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Peterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, who was then baptized Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like this or did the girls change it a bit?
Zs.B.: This piece has been in an instrumental version for a long time and then when we composed the album, we thought that something was still missing from this song.
The sequence of agreements attracted the voice of the song.
I sang the song the girls later that night.
I had it almost immediately and everything was awfully spontaneous.
I remember that it galvanized me at the time, but of course we needed Divas.
With my voice, she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert it also seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There's no solo (except for Judy Jay's short solo), they don't have a single role, they sing all together and they don't sing more loud than music, so the music does only accompany their song.
They were behind on the stage too.
Is that what you want?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is only technical problems.
What was voluntary, however, was that we did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song also says that we must forget our ego a little, forget where it comes from, who goes or, we just have to let these wings, the wings of love, take us.
I also wanted others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which songs made you work the most?
Zs.B.: Actually, none of the musical creation process, we had more difficult pieces during the mixing.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I'm playing a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for long, and then, small to small, everything was set up like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite about the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and because I've already released this album.
At this point, they are Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The retailer is at risk of billions because of its inferiority complex
A dissimulative fraud.
Thus it designates its former employee the French giant the General Society, owner of the Czech bank Komerczyn banka.
The bank has lost nearly five billion euros because of it.
However, it seems that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to equal his colleagues, and who, moreover, cannot be regarded as incapable at all.
Unlike all the large bank houses, he recognized the crisis in the US mortgage market on time.
"He's weak," they let his superiors hear him report to the police.
However, if you hold on to Kerviel's statement reported by the French media, including Le Monde, this man's transactions produced a profit of EUR 1.6 billion at the end of last year.
The crisis exceeds the United States
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the US crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that mortgages called "sub-prime", granted to low-income customers or those who had encountered difficulties in the past, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he did.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to EUR 1.6 billion.
"As soon as I had won my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel confides and adds that he has, of course, kept nothing for himself."
Throughout the questionnaire, he must have forged the reports in order not to be disappointed.
He managed to divest his superiors, although the Eurex stock exchange began to take an interest in his transactions.
There's nothing at all that's at stake.
Did he fear to be discovered?
Not at all.
"I thought the simple fact that I got 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did he come from to risk so big?
He's only getting to his position gradually.
He had started working at the General Society in 2000 just after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was $51,000.
Two years later, he was already a trade assistant and in 2005, he became an independent trade with an annual salary of $90 thousand.
However, he knew he would never win as much as the others.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew I was much less considered than the others.
In view of my university course and my professional and personal course," said Kerviel investigators.
But shortly after his entry into office, he won his first great success.
Thanks to Alliance's actions, it won a half-billion euros by putting down this title during the London attacks.
And the mechanism was set in motion - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we leave you alone.
"It was like a snowball effect," he told the police.
But the superiors were aware of everything, or rather, they doubted it.
"As long as I won, they seemed to close their eyes."
But that's when it happens at the beginning of the year.
He loses a billion euros in a day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decided to hide the sum.
Monday, when he comes to work, he is no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of it.
And how did we find him?
He became a suspect because of his leave.
"Last year, I took only 4 days off.
A trader who doesn't take vacation is a trader who doesn't want to leave his book to another," Kerviel concludes.
Czech Republic on the occasion of receiving 365 billion
Yesterday, Czech government ministers signed in all nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, contribute EUR 14 billion (about EUR 365 billion) to the Czech Republic.
This is almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly 125 billion crowns from seven operational programmes will be allocated to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to get about 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit most from up to 150 billion.
The Transport programme is the most important operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources the Czech Republic can obtain in the context of these projects.
This money will result in an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage a sum of $90.8 billion next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme, for SMEs and entrepreneurs, must provide financial means to encourage innovation within the company.
Businesses should have financial means for the introduction of new technologies, industry research, but also for the introduction of new more efficient management methods.
To date, the Czech Republic has been among the new members of the EU's least-successful beneficiaries.
The Tribunal confirmed the 20-year prison sentence for the former President of Nicaragua
The Nicaragua Court of Appeal confirmed on Thursday the 20-year prison sentence for the former President of the country Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for a fraud of $100 million (about $1.8 billion).
Later, he was released and was assigned to live in his farm near the capital of Nicaragua.
Whether the former head of this Central American state, depending on 1997-2002, will be re-incarcerated or not, according to the AP agency, is not clear.
According to the President of the Ileana Pérez Court of Appeal, everything will now depend on prison officials, or they will either let Germany finish his sentence, or he will go back to prison.
4 years ago, the Tribunal proved that Germany regularly moved the government's money to foreign companies' accounts in Panama.
These were fictitious companies, and the accounts were actually owned by members of his family and his closest supporters.
Some of this money went to the funds that Germany had created to finance its electoral campaign in 2001.
The budget was adopted
That's right.
The State budget was adopted.
In what is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without the support of the opposition.
This one was spent a year ago with the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, as it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and ČSSD could not afford to refuse.
Contrary to the heated debate prior to the vote of the statement of opposition to the government, this time nothing dramatic.
The House of Deputies has adopted this law without any problem, which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
Here's some kind of paradox.
Whether we want it or not, each chapter and every article is the beginning and the end of every government.
The budget is an integral part of the policy, although it is hidden behind the competition for power that opposes government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media and that is why it is given more attention in the media.
Political men's disputes are much more interested in the opinion than in the abrupt figures.
The national budgets of the past socialist governments suffered from three woes that the current budget is not capable of regulating at the same time:
The first is the important part of the bill's mandate costs, not only for retirements, but also for social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" bringing together the ČSSD and KSČM parties.
The second is a deficit economy, the consequence of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the lack of public finances, i.e. the lack of cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the deficit of the state budget that represents the largest wing.
He is a public and under control.
The real bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued bonds, disproportionately indebted to their municipalities, in order to obtain, apart from money from taxes, tax duties and bank credits, new sources of investment.
In the past years, they were able to repay these debts by selling in bulk the shares of distribution systems, including those of energy obtained from the State in the context of privatisation.
Today, they no longer have this source.
If only official and verifiable facts are adhered to, it is found that:
Our economy has been going through for several years, like the rest of the world, a phase of growth and ČSSD is not missing.
It was a unique opportunity for this party's successive governments to regulate public finances.
Instead, they owed the State more and more.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame that rests mainly on the previous governments.
We are among the countries that are at least at a global level threatened by poverty.
We therefore have no need for massive social programmes that have unfortunately been inflamed up just in recent years.
Although some of the absurd populist expenditures approved last year before the elections have been eliminated, if a change in the age limit for retirement and a reform of the pension system will not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in that country and whoever is in power will only administer.
By exaggerating, it can be said that political men in power will become bureaucrats that distribute mechanically the majority of the money imposed between retirement and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that makes regular costs rebate by the cost of mandates.
The deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely unnecessary if the previous governments had not spent all the money they could.
If we really do not want it to happen that the policies in power become simple bureaucrats, we need to be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the State can only spend the equivalent of what it can collect in taxes and tax duties, the calm necessary for the preparation of new reform laws.
There are only those who will gradually achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the English, Swiss and Canadian central banks decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than a hundred billion dollars will thus be placed on monetary markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, through a system of auctions, the interest rates to which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Federation will send $40 billion to the auctions and will also provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the Central Banks of individual States have decided to take action at this concerted point to prevent or reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to solve the major economic problems, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl's report to the customers of the Economic Advisory Society Outlook Group.
"The concerted action of the Central Banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent," Baumohl adds in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to outstanding loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are still waiting for other losses in billions.
"If the Central Banks have chosen this approach, it is that they really need to understand what can still be achieved," said the economist in charge of ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems the situation is really bad," he added.
Central Banks are afraid that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and drown the US economy in a recession that could influence the economic growth of the world as a whole.
The Central Banks made this choice after failed to reduce the interbank rate of London, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were always afraid of mutual loans, even though the U.S., Canadian and English central banks had repeatedly reduced their interest rates during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as a new drop in interest rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio from Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the central banks' approach will contribute to conjure up the crisis, as it does not address the main problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the USA.
President Klaus: The debate of environmentalists is incredible
Global climate change is expected to be particularly detrimental to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again spoke on the problem of global warming.
This time, the criticism of the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change ended in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not Green, he said that the discussions of environmentalists were incredible.
According to Klaus, this is not only the structure of the conference, made up of a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric of the companion and the reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it is only a gap of words, a replacement of solutions to the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed, when presenting his book, that his subject was of great importance to him and that is why he is so committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book also appeared in German translation, as he said, "I often encounter only the caricature of my opinions."
Interested persons can now read their positions without being deformed.
Klaus recalled that although he was not a climate scientist, he felt that he had enough provisions to write such a book.
It is indeed an academic able to follow and appreciate scientific treaties, it has the practice of statistics and it is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following: the constantly changing climate, the changes in it are normal, there is no opinion shared by all researchers on global warming, the effects of current changes are neither too important nor too serious, they therefore represent no danger and, finally, the efforts made to influence climate change are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptable.
As far as the experience of a totalitarian regime is concerned, it considers it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which it feels as a dangerous attack on freedom.
In response to the questions of the people present, he explained on several occasions that it was not against "a reasonable protection of the environment, but against an integrated environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the benefits they bring".
In Vienna, Klaus had already talked about this two months ago at Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people failed to renew their driving license in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have allowed the deadline to expire and have failed to renew their old driving permits whose validity is due to expire at the end of the year.
We are the last day where people can still ask for renewal, so that the authorities can issue a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid permit will take the road.
According to the authorities, they did not renew their license to drive, especially those who did not want to drive anymore.
While the municipalities report a drop in the number of licence renewal applications, the authorities in the capital are invaded by applications and the number of licence renewal applications is increasing this week.
Mairie satisfied about 2,000 customers a day.
There's a tail of about half an hour.
In Prague, approximately 140.OOO drivers have not yet renewed their driving license.
The issue of a new permit takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to request the issue within a short period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an additional five hundred kroner.
Vehicle drivers who will not be able to carry out the mandatory renewal of the driving licence by the end of the year and will borrow the road without a valid licence will, as of January, risk a fine.
The guilty person will be forced to pay up to two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer can also deal with the offence by resorting to a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the amendment amounts to 2500 kroner.
According to ancient information, even a person who was not going to move was liable to a fine.
In doing so, it could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Department had called the authorities for moderation and imposed fines not exceeding 1000 kroner.
However, according to Karel Hanzelka's Department of Transport's spokesperson, no one is at risk of fines in tens of thousands.
The driving licence is, according to him, a document that people can decide whether they want it or not.
It's not like with the identity card that, she must be valid without exceptions.
People who do not want to drive should be allowed to drive again.
It is enough to bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licence.
Persons with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to carry out the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanselka, it is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal has reduced the penalties for detectives covenanted with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Konňarík, former police officers accused of connivance with David Berdych's gang, will be 13 and 10 years in prison respectively.
The Supreme Court of Prague has thus definitively condemned them by reducing their sentences to 1 and 2 years, respectively.
Originally, the Department's detectives for the fight against organized crime were sentenced to 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today's judgment, only one appeal to the Supreme Court is reasonable.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he is waiting for the verdict of the first instance.
However, he has already been sentenced to 16 years in other trials.
He can't get any more.
In January, the Departmental Tribunal found guilty of participation in holding-up 19 persons, and today the Supreme Court was dealing with the 16 appeals.
Most of the accused referred, since the beginning of the investigation, to the charge by claiming that it was a handled case.
According to the Central Bohemia Court of Justice, police members, after agreement with Berdych, transmitted information from police sources to criminals, covered the various holding-ups and helped gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang sent 30 percent of the larcin to Opava and Konňarík.
The charge is a criminal activity of the gang in the years 1999 to 2001.
In most cases, the victims of armed flights suffered a serious health attack, but also abuse of the power of a public agent and of the prohibited weaponry.
During domestic searches, the police actually discovered illegally detained guns, oboes with a steel core, a laser-directed shooter or a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang has enriched itself with tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from about twenty men in this trial, the courts have already found guilty of other lifted-up flights Berdych and a whole series of others.
Other men from Berdych's neighborhood are still explaining themselves to the court in another case, some cases have not yet arrived at the court.
The main hearing has, for the time being, prevented Tomáš Póta and Maroš Šuljej who are currently in detention in Ireland, where they await the final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The substitution price for children: 12 million
Igor Veleba's family attorney wants to get a 12 million crown compensation from Trebíč's hospital.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for fathers and one million for each of the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the lawyer at the Ondřej Dostál hospital disagrees with Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such a claim, which is very high," said Dostál at the hearing.
"In order to be able to get an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert report that the adverse party ordered.
We're going to check if this one has any explanatory value.
But we continue to think that the total amount should not exceed hundreds of thousands," Dostál said.
According to him, the amount should be set between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the start of the case, Jablonov's family demanded a million crowns for each month where she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, written for him by the University Hospital Centre in Prague-Motol, as a supporting document for compensation negotiations.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The situation of stress has been better borne by men, although they have been confronted with the remorse that they have not been able to prevent the replacement of newborns.
Women, they remain less serene in the face of the current life of trauma and in the face of what is happening right now, have summarized the contents of the Veleba report.
Veronica and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the Trebíč hospital on 9 December.
Last week, children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Chermák in Pribyslavice and Veronica to the Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabloňov.
The governor of the Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil region handed to each of the families 100,000 crowns for reimbursement of expenses incurred by the error of the Třébíč hospital managed by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are subject to the law on civil liability insurance.
In the event of a failure, they must be in the reserve fund, exceptionally, they can ask for assistance from the manager.
So far, the courts recognized relatively small damages, the amounts calculated according to the tables were in the order of hundreds of thousands, with the exception of millions.
Poultry and peas of the Kingdom of Wales (by the Kingdom of Wales)
Bolek Polívka and lost le litige aux suspense de la marque Valašké kingdom (Royaume de Valašsko).
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, he was actually the one who had used the title King of Valasko for the first time, but the project was set up by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, the former actor's collaborator.
Polivka was not present at today's hearing.
But according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will call.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team are paralysing on the popularity of Bolek Polívka," said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
According to him, the words of the Kingdom of Valaško refer to everyone just this actor and comedian.
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
"There's been a job behind us for almost ten years.
Looking for money and developing events," he said.
According to him, it's money that's the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could benefit from it.
They want to parasiticize our work," he added.
A profit-making business
According to the court, it was Polívka who first used the title Valašký kral (King of Valaško) in his television show.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohatý had crowned him king in 1993.
At the time, however, it had nothing to do with the plan to establish a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came with the idea of showing passports from Valaške Královjök.
From a humorous action to a source, it came out of a profitable business and commercial activity, followed by the creation, by Harabiš, of the company Valašké královwyk.
In 1997 Polívka accepted that his name and signature were quoted in the passport and even offered the holders of the balance on the price of his farm visit and his theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš only used the nude idea, published by Polívka in the management issue, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka has certainly helped the Valaške Kingdom project," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was made up of Harabiš and his team who would devote themselves to the project in an intense way.
The collaboration between the present-day enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, which culminated in the statement "of King Boleslav 1 elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, assumed by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as Queen mother.
Then, in 2002, Polivka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, claiming that the court today rejected.
What could make the case clear is the tournament planned for the throne and half of the princess.
He should get a new king out of it.
He didn't want to betray the details and the date yet.
"We don't want to go fast in need.
It would be something like the parade of kings in Slavácko.
The king would be elected for a while.
Even Mr. Polívka can of course register," Harabiš added.
Test of Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTI: disappearance of prejudices
Actually, I've never been a big fan of Peugeot 206.
Its rolling quality was nothing extraordinary, the quality of speed change, driving and also that of manufacturing could, in many respects, be described as lower than the average.
However, there is currently on the market its successor the Peugeot 207 which, she, is much better.
As the SW-named van goes a little further, I just want to think more about it.
When I tested the classic Hatchback of the Peugeot 207, I complained, for example, about the space for the head on the back seats.
While the complaints are over here because the combi bodywork means that even the big devils will be at ease in this regard.
Let's go see what's done.
I'm going to call the inside very quickly so I don't repeat myself.
This is an almost successful design, my only remark on the central tunnel that seems to me to be poor.
There, I would have liked a design a little more inventive, since the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when we could complain about seats or files too short is revolutionized.
Lateral guidance has also improved significantly compared to model 206.
As for space, the increase in body size is also noticeable here.
The Combi also sees the lack of space above the above-mentioned head.
A safe in the safe
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage bag.
I need to assess this as very accessible (also thanks to the back-glazed rotating ice) and a rather easy recovery.
Blind spaces are equipped with arrest elastics that constitute an ideal compromise.
It is not covered and can be extended while being able to hold rather heavy objects.
But let's stop at the volume.
He does, according to the tables, 428 l in the base configuration, which is relative to competition a rather average figure.
Apart from Škoda Fabia Combi, the most sold vehicle of this category in Czech Republic.
If you compare 207 SW to the new generation of the product of Mlada Boleslav, you can see that the Peugeot remains very sensitive behind, the difference being 52 litres.
When it comes to going on vacation abroad or loading a compass, this figure is almost critical.
However, if I had to highlight the benefits, I would mention the bottom of the box left after the return of the rear seats perfectly right, or a very low walkway.
120 horses divided into four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And, in fact, it should look like a 1.6 that makes a family Hatchback walk.
He is quiet, he consumes little and, above all, he pushes well.
If I compare it to the equivalent produced by Škoda, which often gives the impression of having a pot of escape pierced by a snake, then I can't be an enthusiast.
Let's go through the tariffs.
The price of the vehicle is not affordable for all.
However, we must be aware that a well-equipped car has been tested, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto 1.4 litre engine rising to 329 900 Kč is still passable.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 Kč, which is already sufficient.
The Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price of 80,000 Kč.
However, we also have head airbags, automatic air-conditioning, automatic ice wipes, automatic rear window control...
In fact, the vehicle costs at the end of the account 531 900 Kč.
That's a lot, but try to add the extra equipment to the Fabia price and you'll get a very similar figure.
So there's nothing left but choosing the brand.
The integration of Slovak students into British schools is wrong
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, which causes concerns among residents about the evolution of local education.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans is currently facing a series of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of indigenous peoples turn into violence.
The case of the Kent of the North, where the remaining and immigrant opponents of Slovak origin are beginning to accentuate, well illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
Disputes, jokes, and misunderstandings between students have been transposed into the relationship between parents.
The situation went so far that the police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who hit a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The guilty defends himself by claiming that the boy had insulted him by racist speech.
The police also had to intervene as a result of the attack on a Slovak immigrant carried out by two teenagers.
The young girls had allegedly addressed this man with racist remarks and threw him out of the stones.
"When we came home, a young man climbed on the bus stop and began to scratch on us.
When I told him to stop, he answered with apples and pears and then discovered his cheeks," said another unpleasant adventure a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the remaining ones has gone to qualify the conflicts with the immigrants fighting for survival.
The above cases show that the atmosphere in British schools between natives and immigrants is beginning to develop.
70 thousand Slovaks who came to find work are registered in Great Britain.
And about 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful Caribbean island
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacations can happen if you make a good choice.
Golden and white beaches such as snow, high waves or then a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and everything included with servers offering you on the beach a pizza, ice or both of lignite cocktails.
The kitesurfing, the golf and the roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but enriched.
However, there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
By the time of the Spanish, Cuba had been the base of their invasion of America.
Christophe Columbus described it as the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana has become the warehouse and place of transshipment of the treasures that the Spanish had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was erected at the beginning of the 20s.
It was Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, who built it, since everything that was a crime in the United States (especially under the ban) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients, there were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tall buildings were built and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 50's of the last century, circled on large boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco, Paula, near Havana, and, in Cojímar, he had his yacht.
The stars of the show business and political men from all over America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Havana Bodeguita.
At the Hotel Nacional bar, a luxury hotel, you will be mixed the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars are still operating in Havana, as the jugouli and the so-called imported fiats have long, in such a salty and humid climate, become rotten.
Even though Havana, especially the oldest part, is significantly deciphered, there is no part else in the surrounding areas as many beautiful colonial monuments as there are right there.
Other places become more beautiful, such as Trinidad.
Since tourism brings money if necessary, its development has green fire.
Over the past 15 years, new hotels have been moving not only to Havana, but especially to Varader, on the coast of Holguín Province, as well as on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by small train lovers.
The cane had returned from the plantings extended into the sugarries on a narrow path by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades and this is how small locomotives whose contemporary ones are not only in museums.
Where's he heading?
Most visitors do not miss the most famous places.
So there's no need to write it long on Varadero or on Havana.
Otherwise, remember that in Hemingway's property, already mentioned, there is a museum and that whoever loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The Valley of Vináles on the west of the island is one of Cuba's most picturesque corners.
An exuberant vegetation pushes it on a limestone soil.
Mogots, limestone balloons and rocks rise in trade from the bottom of the valley, and, from the fertile land they have taken into their nests, even its porous rocks are covered with a very dense plant carpet.
The valley is the place where you probably grow Cuban tobacco of the best quality.
You will be able to meet the final form of this product if you visit one of Havana's cigarette factories.
Someone might also find it interesting that Major Zeman's Chilean episode was turned around.
Trinidad
Old town founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It is the trade of slaves and that of sugar that has brought him glory and wealth.
The richness has incarnated into the beauty and the city-vitrin character of this small town.
The colonial Spanish architecture, strongly influenced by later French settlers, has not changed in almost four centuries.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the mountains of Escambray, is a place so far away that in the 50's of the last century, there was no road to connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay away.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't demolish anything, and everyone just had a roof over their heads.
If you have more time than a afternoon in Trinidad, then it is worth going to see interesting places around, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the Sucreries Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música, which is animated after the sun's sleep and where the music happens only in the morning.
Baracoa
Some refer to this village in the Far East of Cuba as the most beautiful island.
This opinion is certainly already influenced by the way in which it is carried out.
The two roads that have flown there since Guantanamo must cross high and uninhabited mountains and pass through an almost unmarked landscape of human activity.
UNESCO has listed the Eastern Cuba option, thanks to its intact landscape, on the list of world heritage.
The best chocolate is made in the church, there is Christophe Columbus's cross (in fact, she saw the day about a hundred years after Columbus' journey) and since the hill where the former castle-fort and the current El Castillo hotel are held, there are several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigarettes, mountain massif Sierra Maestra, the Bay of the Truys and the island of the island of Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the shrine of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, African religions practiced by the descendants of the former slaves, about all this could be filled with a lot of pages.
Only, as we say, it's better to see once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, Americans say
The lack of necessary soldiers and equipment affects, according to the United States, the progress of the mission to Afghanistan.
According to the Minister of Defence Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the years to come.
The mission to Afghanistan is not going on as it should, and representatives of countries with troops in the southern part of the country have agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing opposition from the Taliban movement, the eight States involved are also today discussing future plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States called NATO troops for greater activity this week through the Minister of Defence Robert Gates, Britain sees the strengthening of the Afghan government's authority and the strengthening of development aid as a priority.
"Evolution in Afghanistan is noticeable, but military power can only form part of the solution.
The other is to enable the inhabitants to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," British Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC chain.
Twenty-eight percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is, according to the U.S. military data, the most intense of these five years.
The number of violent acts increased by 27 per cent compared to last year, up to 60 per cent in Helmand Province, south of the country.
NATO countries have about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, nearly a quarter of them in the southern part.
However, according to the United States, the allies have reached their absolute limit both in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Specifically, they ask for other helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete objectives for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop has today made similar statements.
"I am not happy with what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about 40 percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the end of the talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo that would last three days.
Who's passive
In recent months, there have also been conflicts among countries involved in the issue of whether all allies are actually doing their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticised for its liability.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the fighting requirements they are subject to are not as strict as those in the South and East parts of the country where we operate," Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun qualified German soldiers as Persians this week.
"The Afghan fans discovered: the Germans play, while our fighters," Sun wrote in a document completed by pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild passed into counterattack by publishing the photo of a British troops during a rugby game in southern Afghanistan.
The debt of the State will rise to a billion in 2009
Each Czech State is responsible for a debt of over 84,000 crowns.
The total debt is raised at the end of September at SEK 842.7 billion.
The government had planned to borrow $159.2 billion this year.
As a result of the better-than-planned state budget savings, the Department has reduced the estimated amount to $152.8 billion.
The debt of the State of the Czech Republic is raised towards the end of September at SEK 842.7 billion.
Thus, during the nine months of this year, it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, starting in June, it decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has thus confirmed its data on the debt of the State at the beginning of October.
The charge of a debt exceeding 84,000 crowns is charged to each Czech.
Over the past year, the state has been indebted to over 111 billion crowns.
"For now, it seems that, due to a less significant deficit planned for next year, one could exceed the limit of a billion crowns in 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and a billion crowns," said Patria Finance analyst David Marek for the iHNed.cz server.
The forecast of the next Financial Analyst Vladimir Pikor is similar: "We could go beyond the billion in the course of 2009.
The precise date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it appeared that the political situation was changing, that policies were ready to save more, the date could be postponed until 2010.
But I don't expect this change," he said.
Debts grow
The debt of the State is the debt of the central government and is mainly due to the accumulation of government budget deficits.
The debt of the State is financed by assets of the treasury, interest securities, direct loans or, for example, by loans to the European Investment Bank.
The State's domestic debt increased from $38.5 billion to $711.4 billion this year.
The State's external debt increased this year from SEK 1.7 billion to SEK 123.3 billion.
The debt of the so-called negotiable State reached the end of September 803.3 billion crowns and from June it decreased by 13.7 billion crowns.
The average debt requirement of the State was 6.5 years.
"The total debt has increased from 1st to 3rd half annually by 13 percent, which is, given the current good health of the economy, a very high figure.
It is interesting that the increase is mainly generated by interest rates where it reaches 20 percent.
It is wrong for debt to grow, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be a topic to be negotiated when the retirement reform comes," said the Pikora data.
Better than what we expected
It follows from the government's funding and debt management strategy for 2007 that the government had planned to borrow $159.2 billion this year.
However, at the beginning of September, thanks to a change in the economy of the better budget of the State, the Department reduced the estimated amount to $152.8 billion.
The sum is mainly due to the government budget deficit, which is obviously going to reach 76 billion crowns this year, instead of 91.3 billion originally planned crowns.
These are the maximum sources for the Czech Consolidation Agency, i.e. 13.3 billion kroner, the 10 billion reserve for pension payments, the financing of state income for 43 billion kroner and the repayment of the European Investment Bank's loans of 1.8 billion kroner.
She compared today before a court in Khartoum for having appointed a bear in a pelican
The British teacher who was tried in the Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced to 15 days in prison by a court in Khartoum on Thursday night and in exile, said his lawyer.
The British was accused of leaving students between 6 and 7 years of age to give the name of Muhammad to a bear in a cage while any representation of the Prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was subject to a fine of gunshots.
This 54-year-old British teacher was arrested at the Khartoum Unit High School in the Sudan on Sunday and accused of violating Islam and sedition, under section 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints from student parents from the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
In fact, the story goes back to September, when this teacher asks her students, aged 6/7, to choose a name for the bear in the classroom.
"Eight names come out of the children's mouth, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says the school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their favorite surname.
Mohammed is certainly the name of the Muslim prophet, but especially a very common name in the Sudan.
The children then produced a book for the class with the bear photo followed by the legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself did not bear any label with that name, but the problem is simply the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, teaching at the same school in the Sudan, stated that he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that might be insulting to a religious faith, "I regret that she just asked the children to vote for a name," he said, it is only an "innocent error".
Notice shared by many students of the institute who describe it as “very attentive to its students” and “who never talk about religion in class”.
Let's remember that the surname Mohamed is also the second most common surname in Great Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This surname often chosen by Muslim families is a way to honor the prophet (usually given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this surname?
Can we give it to a toy, for example?
This is, of course, an interpretation issue.
They did not reach agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday at the last negotiating meeting in Vienna.
In the end, it fails.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians completed a sixth and final discussion session in Baden, Austria on Wednesday morning, without being able to overcome their differences in the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties were unable to reach an agreement on the status," European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was "at stake", American counterpart Frank Wisner urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"We do not expect violence at the moment, but we enter a very difficult time," he added, adding that there are "evident tensions".
End of mediation on 10 December
The troika mediators, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province with 90% of Albanian telephones could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko return their report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and last negotiating session since the troika was tasked with a new mediation by the United Nations last August.
Americans and Europeans believe that their mediation will be completed on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence to Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond that date.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of unrest in Kosovo, the West believes that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina is prepared to declare it unilaterally if the Security Council does not take a stand for it.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," announced Kosovo's President, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the Baden hotel where these "last chance negotiations" have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former Kosovo Rebellion Commander and future Prime Minister of the province, expressed his regret.
But he added that Belgrade's plan of autonomy "was part of a past that led to murders and deportations".
‘Domino effect’
Serbian President Boris Tadic felt that a compromise was still feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade said, inter alia, to reduce a 'domino effect' in a region still weakened by the 1990s independent wars.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision should be returned to the Security Council alone, where its Russian ally had a veto right.
'The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word'
"Only one solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council."
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status," adding that any unilateral declaration of independence from Albanian telephones would be "in consultation" with the West.
Bush draws an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the international peace conference, which he attended on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and the Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to engage immediately in negotiations to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old content among their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructures" and Israel must end its colonization activities," Bush said, recalling both parties' obligations with regard to the "road map" for the peace they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim "to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues".
This call covers the three thorny problems at the heart of the content between the Israelis and the Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees driven from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US President, Abbas insisted that future negotiations be "global and in-depth" and address all aspects of a regulation, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
In his turn, Olmert undertook to make future talks "direct and continuous" and to make "an effort to close them in the course of 2008".
At the end of 2008, Bush set the deadline for implementation of its "vision of two States" Palestinian and Israeli coexistence.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had made a commitment in this regard to Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the origin of a plan, carried out by all Arab countries, which offers Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a carefour in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", says Prince Saudi in his interview with the Arab daily Saudi capital.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened, Sunday?
As with every time in this different type of fact, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the National Police Inspectorate's survey, a police car circled Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., Louise-Michel Street, Villiers-le-Bel.
"She was not in intervention, but in patrol, and she circled 40-50 km/h, without a gyrophare," explains a police source.
A green bike from the Kawazaki brand, "unapproved, therefore not allowed to circulate on the public road" (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated "very long".
"She hit the police car on her left, after a refusal of priority to the right," says a police officer.
Alcohol control on the occupants of the vehicle has proved negative.
The condition of the car (before fainting, starry bristle, rooted bristle) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very soon, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had commissioned an investigation into "involuntary homicide and non-assistance to persons in danger" at the IGPN, co-sponsored with the Departmental Directorate of Public Security of the Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor stated that the IGPN investigation at this stage was depriving police officers of responsibility.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard Sunday night, confirmed "the version of the policemen, namely that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on their left".
Yesterday, a sort of tear, no doubt caused by the friction of the treads on the ground, showed that the two vehicles were stuck in the time the police car was able to stop.
Vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened just after?
Yesterday, a rumor circulated quickly in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the policemen would have quickly left the premises, thus not giving aid to the two young people.
The IGPN, while being cautious, would also avoid “all serious errors” regarding this point.
"This is an aspect of the more difficult investigation, which requires more research, which needs to be very careful," said a police source.
Liberation met an eye witness of these few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows giving exactly on the scene.
"We immediately went down, with my cousin who is nursed to the hospital, to try to rescue them, tells this witness.
There was nothing to be done."
He then saw "a completely hagard police officer, who was fighting.
Two others were trying to reanimate one of the young, the fourth was talking on the phone."
In the face of the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and seems to have had people present in the unexpected situation of young people, police officers have been taken by colleagues on the scene.
According to this witness, the relief arrived "about twenty minutes after the police left".
They also practiced heart massages, in vain.
"I will not let you say that police services did not assist young people.
These young people have been helped.
The firefighters have arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save them," the prosecutor pointed out.
The tension rises in Pakistan
The Pakistani police have repressed the first demonstrations on Monday since the establishment of the state of emergency two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who protested against the emergency measures were injured by the lacrymogenic grenades used by the order forces, according to witnesses.
The latter responded by throwing stones at the police.
At least 350 lawyers were interrogated.
Similar scenarios to Karachi and Rawalpindi, or policemen, have charged and injured lawyers.
Several would have been interrogated.
In Islamabad, lawyers from the Supreme Court bar called for a general strike and announced demonstrations following a wave of some 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
Streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the assembly.
Other events would have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (north-west).
The lawyer movement gathered on Monday the support of the religious parties gathered in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president urged the people to send flowers to judges who had pronounced themselves against the state of emergency and to those who had sworn to Musharraf.
''The promise of Musharraf is no longer true''
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly addressed by the exception measure proclaimed Saturday night.
It was to be adopted in the next few days on the legality of the re-election to the President on 6 October at the indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was defeated and replaced.
''All that we attend is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court rulings'', the magistrate said in The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army and become a "no longer" civilian president after the establishment of the state of emergency, the Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
Leaving his military uniform was expected by 15 November at the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government has denouncing strong rumors in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned to residence by his Deputy Chief of Armed Forces.
More than one third of pregnant women remain unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) and malplanned or unforeseen births.
Today, more than one pregnancy out of three (36%) is not planned, a study conducted by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth Act, which liberalized contraception in France, reveals.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) and malplanned or unforeseen births.
The different methods of contraception such as pill or sterile still show a 5% to 6% failure rate, the Ined estimates.
The liberalization of contraception has nevertheless led to a better “infertility control”, according to the Institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill in women aged between 20 and 44 has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight births in ten would be well planned today.
See calculated next month for a couple of five and if possible in spring, season considered as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on space station
It will take more than seven hours of work in space for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his teammates at the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a decomposed solar panel, essential for the continuation of the scientific activities of the station.
A risky exit that has accumulated the records due to its duration, its removal from the habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, the "bricoled" tools by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday while astronauts had downloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery vessel, a large cylindrical room to welcome soon European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of notation quay for the laboratory modules.
But we need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move a solar panel power generation module of 17.5 tonnes, already present on the ISS, to position it on its final position.
After moving it, the crew began re-exploiting solar panels of the module, which are 76 metres wide.
And that's where one of the panels, which expands like accords, has been damaged about a meter by a wire that collapsed.
The deployment was stopped to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts, who originally had to carry out an exit control of the Discovery vessel, then then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go caracoling at the end of the 30 meters length of the remote arm of the shuttle added to the station to perform the repair.
It's one of the best "spacewalker" in NASA.
Great, resistant, very adorable, he has the very developed torso and long arms.
At 46 years of age, this training doctor was therefore charged with "operating" the "damaged" solar panel.
After specifically inspecting the damage, he sectioned the fault cable and installed "atlases" types on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" who remained close to the saddle and, inside, by the other astronauts, including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey channel surrounded by insulation to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "bricoled" by astronauts on the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski expected the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of its tools and returning inside the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts enjoyed a half-day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts do not return to Discovery for a return to Earth scheduled on Wednesday.
The title of EADS sanctioned in the Exchange
The EADS action is currently net down to the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defence group announced that it would have to spend between €1.2 billion and €1.4 billion to deal with A400M delays.
EADS lost 4% to 21.96 euros currently in the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was obliged to review its operational outcome forecast for 2007 following delays due to the slow development of the A400M engine, which condition the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost of paying for the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is 'between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion, of which more than EUR 1 billion for Airbus', announced the mother house of the European manufacturer EADS.
As a result of these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results next Thursday, it will add no further figures.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, the operational result of EADS fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to delays in another program, the very large A380 carrier.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The status quo
There will be no suspension, Sunday, on the exit of the urns: the Russians will opt massively for the party of President Putin, Russia united.
Confirming their aspirations for stability, or for authoritarianism, after a very closed campaign.
At three days of the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends voters a television message on public channels, already registered but the content of which is kept secret.
He does this as Russia's list leader, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory announces itself to be crushing.
Yesterday, the President did not allow anything to appear by receiving foreign ambassadors, merely giving a new charge against the accused West of interference - his theme of pre-election during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and wish for the fairest, most transparent and open elections, the most unaccompanied elections," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from account.
She's reporting a pressure campaign.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there was "never been such a salty election, even in Eltsine's time".
After the repression of last week's demonstrations, the ex-champion of the world of chess Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, remains prohibited from visiting according to his lawyer.
"The Russians have kept the minds of the Soviet homo"
Behind these laws there are two much more open issues:
- Who's gonna succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first presidential round, March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to get to know each other.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot provide a third consecutive term.
But no one succeeds.
- What role would Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and all powerful Russian party who would elect the government and the president?
Whatever the case, both the legislative and the presidential, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have kept the minds of the Soviet homo, they do not feel masters of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent centre of Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov, of the University of St. Petersburg State, goes further: civil society has been lagging behind in this Christianised country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putine has renewed with the model of a paternist state, perfectly accepted by the population of so much more that this new paternism has not been followed by terror, but by some economic assistance," says Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians "refused with personal responsibility" which they had briefly demonstrated after the collapse of the USSR.
"What is the good thought?"
The phenomenon affects all levels of society, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (over 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of Russia together.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
On behalf of what the Russians will not vote for the extremists.
Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54 - year - old professor, concludes: “What is good thinking?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why change them?"
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which represent the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million archived documents, stored 27 km of linear in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were only consultative to date for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and nominally, at the request of an old victim or its right holders.
The eleven States in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, and the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow for research "including on the movement of prisoners, the population of camps and the health of forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, opposed the opening of these nominations to the public because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of certain victims of deportation.
The registers of concentration camps or arrest warrants established by the Gestapo had been collected after war for a practical purpose: to find deported civilians or subjected to compulsory work and, where appropriate, to provide evidence of their detention, in order to open the way for their compensation.
Today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to wait for these documents," said Prof Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Centre for Antisemitism Research at the Technische Universität de Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, the Indo-European bilateral trade has already reached nearly EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hoped to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, indicated the European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
In April, EU Foreign Ministers gave their green light to the European Commission to engage in negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
LEU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the EU's 9th trading partner, according to the figures of the European Commission.
"A free trade pact has a huge impact on both economies" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," said Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, the European Commissioner said. Asian and European giants exchange "47 billion euros of goods" and "ten billion euros of services" this week said Daniele Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation to New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade had not yet reached its potential. The EU and India are meeting for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi on Friday at the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering 10 billion books in five weeks
The Bank of England said Thursday was concerned to ease the current return of concerns on credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds at the base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of unusual duration.
"In order to alleviate the concerns that the conditions of the financial market will be particularly closed at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in the way in which they will organise their liquidity positions over that period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its provision of reserves during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation of five weeks," it states in a communication.
The bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will thus be placed on the market on 6 December at 12H15 GMT, at the base rate and until 10 January.
This is the first time that BoE seems to place liquidity on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These usually take place in a week.
The BoE adds in its communication that it is "ready to take other measures to maintain the rates" of interbank loans on an online basis with its basic rate.
The interbank rate per day was 5.829 per cent Wednesday.
The three-month rate has been 6.6%, a higher rate since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the amounts placed on the market by the Bank of England have been subject to an important penalty rate that has deterred banks from resorting to it.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the book's course compared to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts placed on the market by the European Central Bank at more favourable rates and with more discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups refused on Thursday to discuss articles of the proposed socialist law on purchasing power, which was equivalent to a rejection of the text.
Included in a socialist "nick" (meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted by the National PS Office on Tuesday, including the 50% increase in the employment premium, the restoration of the floating TIP, a check-transport or the rental framework.
UMP and NC having voted against the review of articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting was held at the end of the general discussion, which resulted in trades, sometimes lively, between the majority and opposition to Nicolas Sarkozy's televised intervention on purchasing power for a few hours.
The Chief of Staff of MPs Jean-Marc Airault announced that his group would represent the whole of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending financial law considered by the Assembly next week.
A New Festival Sees Day
Following many rumors about the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with the British producer Melvin Benn's Festival Republic.
"For our company, it is an honor to work with a person who has inspired the current movement of festivals in America," Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for the campsite.
The festival should be held from 8 to 10 August on a private farm of 500 acres to about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Also known as Mean Fiddler, director of Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the Reading Festival bar to the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, then in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival of Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177 500 people.
Qualifying Glasstonbury as the "most inspiring event" he had ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says that his company and Melvin Benn are working in parallel to give the region a European-style event.
"We chose Philadelphia as a market and worked with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"We were talking to the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about this project.
Unfortunately, we are in politics because of the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
" Thankfully, we have been able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the population of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at the Chicago Grant Park, after being marked in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals are held in the urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a field festival, while ours are rather in urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to combine, in one way or another, both formulas to give both an impression of a field festival in Europe and urban America."
Vineland is close to halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, wholeheartedly supports the holding of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but states that "they are interesting enough to allow you to invest in such an event and to host a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the hospitality capacity of this festival is "very great", like that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations had been issued to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed at the time of press release.
"Vineland will taste rock, but the music will be varied, in the hope of attracting all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
Its C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promotion award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It is not easy to attract Hollywood film boards in Montreal when no other Terminator opposes...
This seduction mission is part of the delegation.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it hard to play in the "Governator" legs?
"You have to be careful, it's the industry that decides where it's going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she'll go there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best," he said.
The Festival Race
For the moment, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is to promote the film here.
The Oscars race has begun.
It will be from all the festivals of the West Coast, whether that of Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, a question of presenting Quebec films, developing them and ensuring that the performers make interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a beautiful glass at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be an end-of-year rally in the stock market? The experts divided by the crisis of the subprime.
Within five weeks of the closure of the exercise, investors are already shaking their hands, waiting for the arrival of the traditional end-of-year rally.
This year, however, experts are not even certain that this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December in stock exchange generally has a positive behaviour.
However, statistical forecasts should not be made exclusively, since given the current context, uncertainty is seen in the markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not partisan for the last few weeks of the year, these experts note that "the stock market is fed by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest in the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of fleeing to quality values in both long and short periods".
For this, they believe that the stock exchange will have rather lateral behaviour, not free of volatility "especially because we do not know the likely impact of the fall in Fed rates, given the high level of gross and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions"
Javier Barrio, responsible for BPI sales in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
"It's not the best thing," he assures the expert.
Ibex, the Spanish stock exchange index, has lost nearly 4% since 8 November when the index ended at 15.945.7 points.
However, not all experts have this negative vision.
Juan Solana, Intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension schemes that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert knows that things will be a little different this year because he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the end of the Constitution's feast (December 6th).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect market trends.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, assesses that we are close to technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebound of the index that could be caused by the information coming from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for taking Ibex to new maximum cots.
Solana, from Intermoney, says "this year the great values are back for him."
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and a few builders "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
While, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco, ensures that the increases will be from the bank and the industrial sector.
The builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, where they are placed.
"ACS has been recovering from positions for several months and we hope that other builders like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," the expert explains.
cyclical consumption will be a major factor in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technological enterprises will do so well, although in this case there is not much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
During the last seven years, only two occasions in December was a low month.
The genuine end-of-year rally took place in 2003, a year during which the stock markets came out of the crisis caused by the exploration of the technology bubble.
This year, during which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17 per cent, the month of December recorded an increase of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see whether 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (for the time being Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether it succeeds on its final year rally.
The Popular Bank will open 200 offices from Monday to Saturday
The Popular Bank has decided to renew a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in Spain's most commercial areas.
These branches, which will operate under the Max Popular brand, represent a major change for the bank.
So for the rest of the Spanish organizations, as it is the first group that decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies by 8:30 p.m., and to open Saturday from 10:00 to 20:30 p.m.
Another group that has also repeated several times that it would like to expand the schedules of its branches, BBVA, even though it has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about to conclude an agreement with trade unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturday instead of opening a afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the experience of the Popular Bank will be crucial for other organizations to join or not to join this initiative that coincides with business schedules.
That is precisely what the Popular Bank is looking for.
To attract independent customers who are operating in these areas to buy in SMEs and trades of the streets they choose to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies all over Spain in about 18 months, as this is not the opening of new agencies but a renewal of existing agencies.
To this end, the organization will modernise the branches it already has in the business areas, adapting them to the customer profile of the different streets.
Thus, the amplification of schedules is accompanied by a different design from the interior of the branch and a new, more current design with brighter colors.
The bank's commercial manager, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this renewal does not involve large investments, but staff recruitment, as the number of employees will increase from six to nine per agency.
Agencies, which will also have space for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Popular Bank has already tested its initiative in three Madrid agencies.
And the experience has been positive, as explained by Angel Rivero.
The streets of Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Gran Vía de Madrid are the streets that have been selected, and with apparent success, according to Rivero.
The Popular Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others who worked under the brand Mundocredit, specializing in the case of immigrants, also with very long schedules, which opened even on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax agencies they will not copy the BBVA model, where several of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers,' notes Rivero.
For the time being, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with an external staff at the bank.
Telecinco double for the first time the value of his rival Antena Stock Exchange 3
We're here.
With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a representative adviser to Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction yesterday at the closing of the stock market, when he found that the chain he was running doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
One aspect was his joy: 'what hurts me is not the fact that we have increased more but that we have decreased less', he said.
However, he stressed the fact that on a low market, 'we have fallen less.'
Telecinco finished yesterday with a 2.54% increase.
This gain has stabilised its loss to 15.66% for a year.
The value in Exchange of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13% plus) thus amounts to EUR 4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which gave up 1.52% yesterday and which has accumulated a 40.5% decline since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other communications companies listed in the Exchange amounts to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million in the case of Prisa (Cinco Días publisher) and 1.779 million in the case of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenne 3 is because we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is what we are able to do, on the same market, at what price and how we can afford it in terms of hearing '.
Telecinco announced last week that he plans to become the first television channel this year to exceed the 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as reported by Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
In order to make this announcement real, the television channel should record an increase of 3.6% in its billing for advertising compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
For its part, the net billing of antenna 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (up to 734.4 million) while net TV revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative evolution of Telecinco in the Stock Exchange is the significant payout that he has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profits among its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio may vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
' We have an official commitment to provide at least 50 per cent, although we have always said much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to those to whom we have already given titles with 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market now gives signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profits estimates on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009 to 7%.
This is due, as explained, to the projected decrease in income growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced the forecast for antennae profits from 3 to 4.5% in 2008 and to 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves the Mifid transposition, which entered into force on 1 November.
At the same time as its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote of Congress on the amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government submitted to a public hearing the regulation that would develop the new law, with a view to its entry into force before the year ended.
Representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members and Senators to negotiate and allow the best regulation to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activities of the agencies for the efficient functioning of the markets.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves the modernisation of financial markets, as it reinforces investor protection, improves the powers of the Heads of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various leaders of the European Union.
The new regulation will provide financial advisory services for both specialized social and legal reasons and creates a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial advisory companies (FIAs), which merge with value companies, value agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it increases the number of operating systems on financial instruments so that it is possible to add to regulated secondary markets multilateral trading systems and order internationalization systems, which are facing competition from current stock exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment services undertakings to disclose information on the key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management forms on the market and obliges them to keep a record of all their operations in order to facilitate the control of the share of the CNMV.
By way of derogation from the Commission on the Economy of Congress, several amendments have been added, one of which indicates that the titled debt will be considered as a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has been demonstrated by what happened with the U.S. high-risk mortgage debt (subsidy).
In addition, they benefited from the transposition of the management has benefited from the legal delimitation of the functions that graduates in the Economy may have 30 years after approval in 1977, the Royal Decree delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require the authorization of the CNMV and who will be able to provide its product marketing and attract new customers to various investment firms at the same time.
The price index for harmonised consumption increases by five tenths in November, up to 4.1 %
This indicator, which serves Eurostat to incorporate it in the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance sheet on price developments in Spain during November.
Its publication responds to Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) policy by providing data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as that used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate information that is not yet available for publication.
INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it should not necessarily coincide with the final data that will be revealed on 14 December.
"IPC will continue at relatively high levels"
The second Vice-President and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes said that the increase of 4.1% of the IPC in November was a "temporary figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index would continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has stated in the corridors of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential on monetary union continues to be "more or less" than in recent years.
He also explained that in November, "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government was not facing such a high increase.
"We expected a figure of around 4%," the Minister of Economics acknowledged in relation to today's announced data.
Virgin's plan to recover with Northern Rock 42,000 million euros in three years
The deposits of Northern Rock have dropped by more than 50% to 12,000 pounds (16,800 million euros) since it entered the crisis in mid-September and had to use an emergency credit with the Bank of England.
At that time, he was collecting a few records of more than 25,000 million pounds, a figure that was gradually falling in two and a half months because of the distrust of his clients and despite the 100% guarantee of that money offered by the Government and that it would remain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the organization with her financial brand Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the revenues of British banks that will be deposited in the next three years to obtain these 18,000 million remaining books to reach the goal of 30,000 million.
Richard Branson, known for his advertising campaign in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) a year in advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock has this week appointed the offer of the Virgin Association, to which three other companies are involved, including its preferred to save it from the banking route.
The Mayor of Totana was arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard arrested today early in the morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (the Popular Party) because of his alleged relationship with the urban corruption pattern discovered this week.
In addition, one of the city council secretaries and the municipal police chief were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales, the current member of the right, and until then the mayor's municipal councillor, who, according to the sources of the inquiry consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'teacher' of this plot.
Officers continue to search the municipal premises and those of the Urban Council, and the possibility of new arrests is not out of the question in the next few hours.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, the main suspect of the urban corruption plot, discovered at the beginning of this week, was charged.
As indicated yesterday by the Chain SER to the lawyer of the 'popular Party' MP Juan Morales, he was arrested on leaving Morales's home with important documentation in his possession of the plot.
Moreover, according to the sources of the investigation, the subject matter of the investigation is the alleged acquisition of morale commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galice construction company to re-qualify 200 hectares of land.
For the time being, there are eight people in custody.
Bono agrees to be the head of the Spanish Socialist Party's candidacy for Tolède and to preside over Congress if they win the elections
The former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be the leader of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be the President of Congress in case the Socialists win the general elections.
Thus, the Spanish Socialist Party's organisation secretary José Blanco and Bono even announced it during a press conference after the meeting that took place this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief of the Executive justified the offer made to the former minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
He also stressed that "yes it seems" that the political man of La Manche will be the candidate of the Socialist Group who will preside over Congress if the Socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of Congress, who released his decision last November 15th not to present himself to the next general election and to abandon his political career to devote himself to the fight against climate change in the university context.
The former Minister recognized that the President of the Government had not stopped insisting on his return to the political front-guard since he had abandoned him two years ago.
In addition, he noted that, although citizens already know who will be the economic vice-president if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce the president of the Congress in an "act of transparency".
If he reaches the position, Bono hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect and not of insult or cry" and make it "more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems regrettable that the only place in Madrid where we cannot speak peacefully and calmly is Congress, the President of the Government to the Senate has been interrupted 26 times."
Similarly, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his knowledge to do" and he did not want to act as if he had already occupied his position so as not to fall, as he noted, in what his opponents might consider "a domination".
Climate propaganda
Since the climate change movement is subject to unmerited persecution, both the skepticism of its predictions and those that give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron consistency.
This is more the case for a movement leader who is the chairman of the Government as Zapatero and who believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamic terrorism and who even proposes to sign a “new contract for the planet”.
This approach obliges him to explain why the action or inaction of his Government has made a decisive contribution to Spain's being at the head of the European Union in the non-implementation of the Kyoto Protocols.
Those responsible for the non-execution, in which sectors it occurred and why its Government, the one in the contract with the planet, did not avoid it.
In addition, it must clearly explain to the Spanish what measures it will take to prevent climate change.
What companies will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will we be forced to do, what economic consequences this will bring.
That is, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there was no and there will be no explanation.
Exactly because it's about sacrificing and paying.
Climate change measures, real measures, are unpopular.
Cost-effective, uncomfortable and threatening for businesses and individuals.
Until one hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed to Zapatero so read-only that he was forced to deny it.
That is to say, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
In terms that have an impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman is so useful for electoral campaigns that he does not speak, who does not complain and who does not demand, who embellishes meetings and inspires tenderness.
Provided that this is only limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and that we do not claim to be moving on a bicycle or refreshing ourselves with the fan.
The Mayor and Chief of the Local Police of Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie has arrested the mayor of Totana's Murcian locality, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the chief of the local police, the secretary of the Mairie and a suspicious hotel entrepreneur for possible urban crimes, today reported on the sources of the investigation.
The municipal councillor was arrested at his home and was taken to the city hotel, where many agents met, who were also present at the City Councillor of Urbanism and the municipal management company of the Sun Industrial and Housing.
These three orders are added to the six orders made last Monday in the provinces of Galice, Murcie and Madrid, in an operation relating to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 homes after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislation.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested but are charged with the judicial investigation, as instructed by the Totana Tribunal No. 1.
The first six detainees have now become judicial.
According to the sources, the previous municipal councillor of Totana and currently independent parliamentarian of the PP party, Juan Morales, is subject to the investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as well as the current fiancee of the former municipal councillor, who lives in Murcie.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and contractor of Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonaura, agency of the Nuaria Group, through which the pots would have been made.
The investigation is under the responsibility of the Group of Urban Offences of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Gendarmerie whose officers, in addition to the arrests, have carried out eleven inspections, the majority of the companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
So one person was arrested in Totana, in total, the owner of a very well-known avian product company in the region, which could have played the role of intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company has acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana, which has been requalified and its project would result in double the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonauar, which are engaged in real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the parks of Vigo in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the place of Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, which is responsible for direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent gives us yesterday's comment in Finland's most important newspaper (certain PISA information heads above the educational level in the world), Helsinki Sanomat, which refers to what they published on 18 November, the same day that it appeared there, curiously, the critic of the Blackburn book:
"The content of the course of Philosophy called for public opinion as a result of the tragedy of the school in Jokela.
The culprit of the dead, a bachelor's student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Philosophy Education Adviser, Pekka Elo, called for teachers to adopt a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written in the pages of the daily newspaper Helsinki Sanomat and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in high schools ".

A colleague passes information on the introduction to the Penal Code of Offences on Internet Downloads:
A. Downloading a song would be a punishable offence from six months to one year.
On the other hand, the flight to a CD store for a value of less than EUR 400 is considered to be only a mistake (Article 623.1).
B. Flight to a store for a value of up to EUR 1,000 is already considered an offence, but the penalty is lower than that imposed for the download (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and you return it 40 hours later, the penalty is lower than that imposed for the download (art. 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a trunk than to participate in the traffic of compact disks.
Participating in a tumultuous baggage involves a penalty of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Criminal Code) and CD trafficking would involve a penalty of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film under section 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyright-protected and author-free films is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
Finally, if my colleague is in the truth, then someone is exaggerating.

My treating doctor told me about one of his articles on foreign research entitled 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less '.
In other words, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was carried out through tomographic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the group responsible for neurocognition images of the Institute of Life&Brain, in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed".
Researchers observed that when the two people thought they received the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one of them received the double, the activation was greater.
I don't know if this conclusion would require so much science.
The Balkan Prosecutor
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals since the public ministry of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which is located in The Hague for eight years.
His mandate ends at the end of the year, and Carla will go away with a bitter taste, because the main leaders of the Srebrenica murder - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims are dead - former General Ratko Mladic and former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic are still at large.
Their names are in this list, with the documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach entitled, ' Carla' (2006, not designed exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, who follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade in New York who pursues fugitive criminals and pressures on the governments involved to withdraw the circle.
What kind of insurance do I need?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible misfortunes, involves an important expenditure that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, the age of driving licence, civil status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use that is actually being made of, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
And it is that, choosing the right car insurance is even harder than choosing the vehicle model.
And it is that choosing the right car insurance is even harder than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is materialized by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in exchange becomes responsible for the obligation to pay the compensation in the event of distress.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is based on various factors, such as age, sex, old age of driving licence, civil status, type of vehicle to be insured or the use that is actually made of, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the rate to be paid.
That is why people over 25 years of age and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that these people have a lower rate of misery than their caution.
Similarly, using censuses, companies concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and therefore the probability of an accident.
By increasing the frequency, the probability increases.
They are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
For this reason, the driver must carefully examine the situation in order to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 must face various disadvantages when entering into an insurance contract at an affordable price, such as low driving experience and the old driving licence.
Although the ideal to be sure is an insurance at all risks, there are other more economic options.
The most predictable drivers can opt for any risk-free insurance, so that they get the cover of an insurance at any risk but at a more affordable price.
This form of contract implies that the client pays part of the amount of the penalty.
"The part of the disaster that the client will pay will be determined according to the value of the premium, which will be higher the amount will be lower," said Luis Noguera, the manager in Spain of First Europe, online insurance mediator.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer ensures protection to deal with damage caused to third-party, but for those caused by his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against the flight, fire and vehicle loss.
A tip.
If you are under 25 years of age, try to be careful and avoid hardship to the extent possible, as this will impact on the benefit, which may reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A subsidy is a reduction in the basic rate owned by the company.
On the contrary, sanctions are an increase in the basic rate.
"The benefits and penalties will depend on the company and its benefits.
If the company has had a good year, it may be able to increase the subsidies," Noguera explains.
Over the past 25 years, this becomes easier for drivers at the time of passing an insurance contract, as the rate of disasters is reduced by the accumulated experience.
That is why it is preferable to choose any risk insurance with frankness.
"You can't normally take advantage of the experience you've acquired after an accident," he assures the European company's director in Spain and adds that most accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the fear of the news has passed.
However, if the client is married but has not yet had children, it is preferable that he negotiates insurance at any risk, as long as his economic situation allows.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers as people with the lowest rate of disaster, because increases will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be any risk-free insurance (may be EUR 300), or a third-party insurance from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured person has a high level of bonus.
"They have a more relaxed conduct and they have a greater purchasing power to afford luxury to take on a greater amount of franchises," judge Luis Noguera said.
For pensioners, any risk-free insurance is preferable (being EUR 150), or an extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible disasters, but also because it represents an important expense, that is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that is most appropriate to us in our personal situation.
The Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to reach the eighth final
Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow are coming to San Siro on Tuesday looking for the point they lack to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the Champions League, as it serves Italians to be the first and Scottish to be classified.
The Italians total ten points and they have already qualified during the fifth day with a zero match in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but it still needs another point to make sure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six of them, and who receives Benfica who has four, does not go before him.
These two games of Group D will be played one week before the sixth day ends, as Milan AC will have to compete for the World Clubs Cup semi-finals in Japan on 13 of this month to find a place for the end of December 16.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the zero match at the Giuseppe Meazza stage seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out victorious, as the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic Glasgow knows that winning would remain the first and ensure a better crossing in the eighth final.
A failure of Gordon Strachan's team might be enough to sort out if Shakhtar Donetsk doesn't win, but it won't only computer on this because with nine points the game comes back to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the Milanese will try to poison the Scottish evening, which have good hope of ranking for the eighth final for the second time at the Champions League, after being beaten during the last edition by a goal of Kaka during the extensions (1-0).
Waiting for the victory of the 'redsoneeri' the triumph would return only to Shakhtar, where Celtic would lose, to be ranked for the eighth final in order to continue the League of UEFA champions.
And it is that Benfica, although last and unable to pursue European competition, could achieve third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls started in Vancouver, Canada, in front of some 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the group dissolved in 2000.
' Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) have stated shortly before starting their concert at the GM Place stage of Vancouver that the group meeting is "bright".
Around 20,000 people have exhausted the tickets to attend the concert that was the subject of a video that told the story of the group that raged at the end of 1990.
The meeting and the world tour coincide with the launch of a new album that resumes their main success as well as two new songs, ' Headlines ' and ' Voodoo ', which EMI publishes in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls are on stage showing the bracelets offered by the wife of 'Posh Spice', British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the audience that filled GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days earlier.
Before the start of the show, Victoria Beckham noted that the British footballer "did not see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think of the show."
'Sporty Spice ', which is part of the group in 1998 "because of differences between us" and which caused the group to dissolve two years later, also expressed its nervousness during a press interview, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous, but I saw that people's feelings changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls changed.
And I thought why not, I am happy to have made a decision" Chisholm said about the meeting of the group she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that in time, "the things have been arranged and we appreciate it very much".
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl showed up for the last time in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of babies was waiting for them.
They have seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will be shown in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5-7th).
They will be displayed in Madrid on 23 December.
The new gas case between Russia and Ukraine sends the alarm.
A dispute over the price of gas esterates between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risk of impacts on the export of fuel to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (U.S.) are carried out by pipelines, and each pipeline is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, a change between the two had led to a decrease in supplies to the countries of the United States.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow occurred after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, Russia's gas-supply-supply monopoly company, had tried to find an agreement on the cost of Russian gas-supply to Ukraine for 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would increase as planned, its prices in Ukraine as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts stated that this would include an increase of 40% of the import costs from Gazprom.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the talks, recalling that we are a country where most of the gas is transiting," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinkh told the Reuters press agency.
"The fluctuations in gas costs would undoubtedly be linked to our discussions on transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine"
The last major change between Moscow and Kiev caused in January 2006, the interruption of Gazprom supplies to Ukraine.
This has led to the fall of exports to Western Europe, thereby increasing prices.
Russian gas represents a quarter of the European Union's supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, although most of them are still under development.
As a result, Gazprom completes its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations from the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'must control its foreign employees'.
The Scottish Ministry of Health must improve controls to be carried out on its extra-Community employees in order to verify whether they have criminal precedents, the Monitoring Committee said.
The general auditor's warning, Robert Black, occurred after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack at Glasgow Airport in June.
Mr. Black also expressed concern at the fact that the Scottish Ministry of Health had no specific data on the number of overseas employees.
His report nevertheless highlighted other decisive controls, which were correctly carried out on a sample of employees of five health authorities.
The reviewer-general has carried out controls on extra-Community personnel following the attack at Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28 years of age, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after dark with his jeep in the main terminal.
He took advantage of the three doctors who were filmed in Old Bailey in October, as suspected of being involved in various attempts to explode cars in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas personnel, in order to be certain of the validity of their qualifications, experiences and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses Scotland's Dissolution to carry out criminal background checks, the Agency has no right to obtain such information outside Great Britain.
Among the many warnings, the reviewer-general's report now states that the committees are required to confront the Office of Crime Control, thus enabling employers to undertake controls on various countries.
"Although we have discovered that some information on staff has been well verified, this is not done every time." the report announces.
Mr. Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health carried out most of the pre-employment checks that he himself would carry out, but he added: "Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved in order to ensure that adequate information on certain members of the overseas staff is available to health services.
Mr. Peter Terry, president of BMA Scotland said it was "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment controls could identify employees who could commit future terrorist acts.
He stated that "the report suggests that pre-employment checks currently carried out work well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring added value."
The Scottish health authorities have stated that 1,161 people are employed abroad, consisting of most doctors and nurses.
However, the auditor-general stressed that these figures must certainly be revised upwards, in part because of problems with the identification of staff with an indefinite term contract, which could or may not be chosen, to remain in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current control procedures of the health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are fully adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently revising its pre-employment policy and control system for staff outside the health service.
The Secretary of Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was enthusiastic about doing this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Government of Scotland associated with health committees would carefully consider the warnings contained in the report that should be published next month, and would undertake to ensure better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment controls, and valid for all employees, including overseas persons.
Joy Division dominates the Oscars.
Control, the bio pic on Joy Division's last singer, Ian Curts, picked up 5 prizes, including the best movie, at the Oscars of the British Independent Film.

But the Dutch photographer, better known for his iconic coverage of the U2 Joshua Tree album, won two prizes, the first as the best stager and the second as the best stager.
The Rock has also been rewarded with the Best Documentary Award awarded to Julien Temple's film on the Clash singer, Joe Strummer.
The price of the best actor was given to Viggo Mortensen for his interpretation of the driver of a Russian mob boss, in the thriller based in London made by David Cronenberg, Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, famous for his Korean character interpretations, won the Richard Harris award for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The filmmaker, who has filmed films like Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the follow-up of Indiana Jones, The Kingdom of the Crystal Crane.
Winstone said he was proud to receive this prize named after the star Harris, a protagonist in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney have allowed people like me to have access to the cinema," he said.
"I've been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice."
"I was admiring before this great current actor, I was extremely honored"
The Oscars of the independent film, better known as "The Bifas" are awarded by a jury composed of stagers, actors and festival organizers.
Among the fans and patrons of Bifa are Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Sial and Michael Winterbottom
Saudi Arabia blocks 208 terrible plots
Saudi Arabia reported yesterday that 208 militants were arrested in organized cells operating an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on ecclesiastical and armed forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter said it was one of the missile smuggling cells.
The supporters of Al Qaeda have staged a campaign against the United States monarchy since 2003, following Iraq's invasion.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign resident, planned an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, said the TV newspaper.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a 35,000-military group to protect sites, following a failed Al Qaeda attack in 2006, against the largest oil site in Abqaq.
The newspaper quoted a statement by the Minister of the Interior said that 18 of the arrested people belong to a cell led by a "missile launch expert" who has infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants were planning the eight-missile counterband in the kingdom.
22 persons among the detainees appear to have committed the murder of ecclesiastical and armed forces.
The government asked the ecclesiasticals to do more against Saudis in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting against the Allied Forces and against the Muslim Shiite government allied to the United States, considered heretics according to the Sunny Saudis' hardline.
Al Qaeda militants believe that in Saudi Arabia many ecclesiasticals have worked with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
The activists, encouraged by calls against the Saudi government pro-West, by Osama Bin Laden, leader of Al Qaeda of Saudi origin, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Important efforts have been made by the armed forces during the last five... months" said the Minister of Interior's mouth on state television.
Among the detainees are 16 members of the Media organized in a "media cell" to promote "the taffiri thought", the ideology of the Sunni Muslim radicals who support the use of violence against the faithful and apostolic Muslims.
Among the detainees, 32 persons are accused of subsidizing the militants.
The Venus climate could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live on.
The data from the European orbital vessel have shown that the planet is certainly twice as small as the Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are almost the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that, billions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those of Earth, and could have even been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation associated with a slower rotation led Venus to all other kinds of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, destroyed by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a warm surface to melt the lead.
The findings of Venus Express, the European Space Agency's survey, which has studied the planet for a year, offer a sad vision of the Earth's potential future because of the catastrophic climate change.
Professor of Physics at the University of Oxford, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "We begin to understand why Venus' climate is so different from that of Earth, although the planets themselves are practically similar.
"Our new data allow us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, could even be with a habitable surface."
Of the uranium rich kidnapped by the police.
A kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was kidnapped by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
One police officer said that three people had been arrested and that the equipment was currently being analyzed.
He did not confirm that it was well uranium, but found that the merchandise would have a value of $1 million (£480,000).
Still open to all
Mitt Romney said not to be high as a candidate for the presidency, to answer a snowman's questions.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates have finally agreed to participate in the debate on YouTube, during which many ordinary voters who have registered their questions submit them to the candidates.
On Wednesday evening, November 28, none of the questions raised was as ridiculous as the outcome of another debate on You Tube, when a snowman asked the Democrats for their position in relation to global warming.
But this time, questions and answers have reflected much of the conditions of the Republican party, candidate for the next elections.
It is not known what criteria the CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, have chosen the YouTube clips to show the candidates.
But the first half-hour of the debate, the longest one topic, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong subjects for the Republicans.
CNN asked some electors to call when they would hear funny things: The government raised approval when candidates expressed themselves grossly.
The hardest and longest trade of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr Romney, who is in charge of the important early elections of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was comfortable with illegal immigration during his term of office as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of the Massachusetts, of employing illegal immigrants at his home.
The two combatants became particularly fierce when they were asked if they would be ready to promote an "amnesia" (offering them a regular status and the possibility of becoming a citizen).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have been able to deepen this subject.
None of them have the option to be elected, but both remain in the race, it may be because they have started to fight immigration before and more incisively than others.
In general, candidates, at least with regard to immigration, have the same views: stricter borders, and zero tolerance for clandestine immigrants.
This issue, coupled with concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys manufactured in China, or with other concerns about the outside world, encourages Republicans to forget, or minimize divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other subjects were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether putting water in the nose should be regarded as torture.
One of the speakers asked whether the candidates believed in the Bible as a whole.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare to say that the Bible is his favorite book, even though it is not about believing in the story of Jonas and the whale.
Another speaker asked whether Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
We did not expect to see Mike Huckabee, - in position in Iowa during a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism - declare that the death penalty is painful though necessary.
When insisting on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he laughed and declared that Jesus was too stupid to present himself to the elections.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
The recovery of Mr. Huckabee in Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious research of grants carried out by liberator Ron Paul, and the syllables during the debate on Wednesday.
These two are emerging from the Neath, thanks to the fact that the two party defenders fail to agree to decide who is the most well-known and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party in good time and convincingly thanks to a successful message on the American scale that brought leaders closer together.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pains of Workers
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which to shade; Even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
In view of the trend of British scandals, this is not particularly judicious.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel invoices of politicians, no succulent extra footing.
But here's a revelation that a rich businessman would have masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than £650,000 ($1.3m), that the party would not have declared: A new battle with Gordon Brown would have happened well.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister walked behind in his election project, insulting the British intelligence by saying that opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped otherwise, to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such as Vince Cable, the brilliant democratic liberal leader, said that the terrorist Mr. Brown had turned from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The purchase of Northern Rock, a bank in difficulty on board the crack, showed a lack of guidance and a poor judgment in case of emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data by tax authorities revealed an incredible administrative burden.
A trio of retired generals have launched a revolution among the Lords, protesting against reductions in military expenditures: they have proclaimed that being a minister of defence is for them a part-time job.
Currently, the suspicion of lucid donations by David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of the Workers (and his former head of guard) made them resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is irrevocably heading for the exit.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don't like politicians, and they don't trust them, but they usually leave their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems clear that a prime minister cannot improve things, even rule for a long time, when he is at risk of suspension: the public administration is no longer functioning; ministers' offices are taking stock; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government becomes defensive and no more goals.
In a sense, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
The problems relating to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr. Brown's decisions when he was the chancellor of the British treasure.
And even if it is not directly involved in Blair's woes, such as the long-term investigation into the funds of the "money counting for the members of the House of Lords" party, voters might think otherwise.
But the difficult situation Mr. Brown is not so tragic that she seems to have.
Gaffees are not as monstrous as members of the Tories party.
As in Mr. Bean, there are no victims and no scoundrels.
And the remedy, though painful, could be to implement Mr Brown's Stalinist trends at all times, in favour of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new scandal on political donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very special character, who compared his donations to charity, said that he did not want any public recognition of his well-being.
He may have his opinion, but it's not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of major grantors of politicians are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said that he was aware of Mr. Abraham's programmes, without knowing that this was illegal, should therefore be questioned, as well as Jon Mendlesohn, the head of the subsidy collections that had talked about suspicious donations in October.
But until now, Mr. Brown is not involved: there is nothing to suggest that he has been aware of these actions, even though most of the payments made have been made following his arrival to the government in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has made half of it.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative failure, but he did not draw attention to the fact that the decision-making authority was based on something he knew well, to appeal to a committee of inquiry on this matter consisting of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been slammed, it's from the police.
In addition, there are many other things that Mr Brown must do, such as find a permanent chairman for the Independent Committee on Public Standards, without leading for six months, and prepare a good reform on the financing of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, at a time of weakness, to cooperate with the Tories, which could lead it to give up its particular financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for such a partisan Mr. Brown.
But he should face some partisan events.
The Conservative party now has a good advantage for the elections; it has two years to win the voters, and the only way to win a victory is to demonstrate irreproachable integrity and strong skills.
You were crashing cards.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the US credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's normal to see swimmers waiting, wandering around.
Now that the US real estate market is going through a critical phase, the predators aim at the US credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion extended mortgages to other forms of credit to the consumer.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in the cost and insolvency rates, which measure the unrecoverable balance sheet shares or which are more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in its consumer credit, in part due to the weakness of card holders.
It's just too early to panic.
The costs and insolvency are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the insolvency rate of 3.89% of the third quarter is almost one point compared to its historical average.
The deterioration in rates is partly due to technical factors.
A change in the laws in the United States in 2005 concerning the personal banking route caused a sudden fall in the banking records, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of archives (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if the loan conditions were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the monthly debt that consumers need to settle.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is strong enough despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the volume of emissions for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct links between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers might prefer to increase their earnings now that fair real estate loans have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to the flow of species rather than to the value of the heritage, so the fall in real estate prices has not necessarily led to a change in the creditors' credibility.
They could even benefit credit issuers.
Consumer premiums for the payment of mortgages fall if the properties cost less than the value of the loan; consequently, credit card debt would become a priority to repay all.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgagers and more flexibly to such crisis conditions, as they may change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should, in theory, reduce the risk of a rapid resumption of actions.
"We are not going to wake up in the morning and re-evaluate all the loans," said Gary Perlin, Director of Capital One.
If a financial crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a serious risk of a consequent decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contract in the credit market lead America to recession, industry will certainly have to face a macabre future.
Take good care of the dorsal fins.
The British bankers complain guilty of the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were supposed to testify to their role in relation to a fraud committed by the former financial director of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, arguing that they were guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were first declared innocent of the seven alleged collusive fraud charges in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial robbery in order to enrich themselves despite their employees.
They should be brought before the court in January.
But during an audience chaired by U.S. judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all declared themselves guilty of fraud.
The three former members of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC Group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, have become famous everywhere in Great Britain because of extradition procedures that lasted for two years.
In the United States, their case remains a matter still pending for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges brought against them in 2002 made it clear to Fastow that he was the subject of the government's investigation into Enron's debacle.
The charges against the bankers, called the "three of Natwest", claimed to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the stager of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him call banking procedures.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had considered its interest in the subsidiary null, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the interest of the branch bank for £1 million.
Bankers have paid $250,000 to Kopper as an interest in this company.
According to the claim, Fastow would have falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the branch.
But in fact these $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the allegations, bankers would have earned $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty for his active role in two plots in Enron's debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow has been in prison for six years in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is in prison for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released as a result of a $1 million bail each, which forced them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, before the seventh largest national company, in bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting calls, was no longer able to hide his billions of debt or even propose his bidon speculation as profitable.
The collapse has resulted in thousands of redundancies, more than $60 billion of market value loss and more than $2 billion of loss for retirement plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and former President General Jeffrey Schilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Schilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were false because of his death due to a heart attack last year.
Neither under nor outside Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient fuel autonomy to fly without a scale from Moscow to Los Angeles, is $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
"He can transport up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
"Even if no one really needs so many seats as it is more of a family-use aircraft or for the president of a company."
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream stand, last Friday, at the Millionaires Hall, an incentive for consumption, for four days, which was held in a huge exhibition centre around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to arouse the interest of the new Russian rich for their varied products, going from yachts to diamonds-filled cars like those of 50 cents.
Mr. Fierer was writing a brilliant orange Porsche, exposed to his stand.
"It's a nice car, but nothing comparable to our product," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market."
"Thanks to a boom of oil, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in the black gold, such as Dallas"
"We lived the same in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialists," said Marshall Goldman, senior student of the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University."
Such Saudis in the 1970s, Japanese in the 1990s, Russians emerge as the largest global spending.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to be followed for the sale of luxury goods to markets such as Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billion worth of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest.
In addition, two thirds of the wealth is made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires who total $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists from the Centre for Economic and Financial Research.
(The World Bank stated that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line).
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, a London jeweler.
She participated in the salon for the first time in the company of the Russian distributor, Soho's Bijoutier Group.
"Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune."
Walking in the living room, on Sunday evening, the two real estate agents placed on their 31st, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 said they were like their customers, millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and tried to choose between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Melle Yumatova, who was wearing her high-end coat as a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The salon seems to be primarily aimed at the new rich, the kind of Russian brand buyers willing to make the queue in the pockets to come up to a huge warehouse where they are exposed to Cadillac Escalades, platinum canifs, Mövenpick ice creams, custom billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund bears.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and the best" said Mr. Gijrath, who was proud to be sitting at the Royal manufacturing factory of Dutch porcelain Delf, in front of a wall painting by Raimbrant on blue tiles, handmade.
"It is certain that the Russians are more interested in bling bling"
In fact, the sellers have stated here that Russians with old capital (10-15 years old are too much according to Russian standards) have already moved from branding to a limited edition that could not be sold in the living room.
Despite this, thousands of people, whether millionaires, millionaires' or tourists' emissaries, belong to the exhibition every day.
And some even buy.
During the first night of the exhibition, on Thursday last, Roman Ershow, King Koil's bed PDG, said he had sold two sets of silk mattresses, cashmere, and gold threaded cotton.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the director of A1 motorcycle sales, a company that equips cars with last cry alarm systems, also said he had sold to a Russian millionaire, the bright orange Porsche, for $170,000.
This afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that personalises luxury cars, said he would sell three cars similar to bracelets, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be embedded in Swarovski crystals to look like a wheel wheel.
The four cost $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants to have arson wheels, or a photo of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires," said Karapetian.
He will certainly keep it in his garage containing 30 or 40 vehicles »
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the expression "Russian millionaire" is not on the agenda, given the increase in real estate prices here.
"If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if it is not in cash," he said.
"There's more than you could think"
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the stand of Continental Alliance, a Russian heritage management company.
The company raised four stands representing British telephone booths, full of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the marketing director of the company, said his team had printed 500,000 false bills for the Millionaire Hall.
Passersby stopped to launch lots of tickets, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the right middle of this false wealth or to shut down a few million.
"You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel millionaire," said Mr. Karyev.
Unapproved surgeon suspected of murder in New Jersey
It was the wake of Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the glass bath of the restaurant Just a little Healthier and watched an ambulance that had just stopped at the doors of the Cape Code White on West Scott Avenue.
Then the police patrol arrives.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the medical vehicle stop," said Mr. Livingston, a restaurant manager, on Wednesday.
That's where I realized someone was dead.
The authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine whether the cause of his death is due to a gesture performed by an unapproved cosmetic surgeon, who has not yet been identified by the police, resident at the 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Melle Arroyo's death, but they expect reliable results from the toxicological tests that will take time, but which should enable this mysterious death to be resolved, which has attracted the highest levels of Newark police.
Melle Arroyo was the assistant officer of the police director, Garry F. Mc Carty, since September 2006, and his voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, great worker and tenacity," Mr. McCarthy said about Melle Arroyo in a telephone interview, Wednesday."
"She was like a pit bull"
"She would have done everything to protect me"
Mr. McCarthy said that Melle Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcoholic Drinks Control Commission, and that she left two sons aged 14 and 11, as well as a beautiful daughter.
Eileen Walsj, speaking from the Union's county parquet, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives were trying to determine whether Melle Arroyo died because of an unauthorized surgical operation.
"It's an opportunity to consider."
"The investigation is ongoing."
The authorities stated that they had arrived at her place at 3 p.m.
and found Melle aroyo on the sofa.
She was declared dead.
A little over a week has passed since, and the authorities have not said much about the investigation or even the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Melle Walsh could not confirm whether Melle Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to understand whether a part of the house was used as a medical office.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Melle Castro where a fanned rosier lay in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian lay in the back.
A blue bead called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for the kitchen vanilla and for perfumes, lay in a hangar, next to a door that leads to the ground.
Two bikes of all the land anchored on the sides.
McCarthy said that since his arrival in Newark 25 years ago, in the New York Police Department, Melle Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping him navigate the new city and abandon his framed political culture.
“She said, ‘You must be careful about this’, he said.
"She was there when I arrived, and still there when I left.
"It Was Boring"
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will reduce the rates associated with the global stock exchange.
The shares are blown up on the two sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm the credit conditions, subsequently reducing interest rates promoted by the peaceful statements of the vice-president of the U.S. Central Bank.
Bursary markets explode in London, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Ben Bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, stated that those who decide must be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in the affected financial markets.
In a clear attempt to reassure the irritable markets in view of these new credit-related tensions, Mr. Kohn said that the recent turbulence had partly "reversed some improvements in the functioning of the end-September and October markets.
If this lasting turbulence were to persist, it would increase the likelihood of further rigidity of financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into US markets and that further decreases in interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also allowed Wall Street to calm down with even worse news on the US economy, such as the biggest drop in real estate sales for October.
The impact of this financial turmoil was accentuated as a result of Bear Stearns' statement, an investment bank, which announced that it would license 650 people, i.e. 4% of its staff, to reduce costs to compensate for the heavy losses due to loss of real estate loans.
Only 20 posts are scheduled in London where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones increased by 331 points, or 2.55% to 13,289.40, while the largest index, S&P 500, was 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index took 165.5 points or 2.7% to 6306.2 adding more than 39$ to the value of British companies.
The German index Dax increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 increased by 2.3%.
Previously, the reappearance of credit difficulties in markets was highlighted following the strong demand for a three-month sale of funds from the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at the highest rate of 4.7% since April 2001.
The pressures on the Bank of England to monitor the Fed and the ECB and to inject further funds into the London financial markets causing credit tensions caused the three-monthly "Libor" lending rates to the British banks, resulting in their higher growth since September, at 6.59% following a strong rise since November 12.
England is facing an appeal to the judgment in relation to the criticisms of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the drummer #6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as wide as the first Sri Lanka Test, which will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the electorate who was there exceptionally to assist Peter Moores, coach leader, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to make his decision, and because Hugh Morris, the president of England's Director General, began to complete the nomination forms to become a national electorate, at least in part.
The one who fails to win the No.6 dossier will be bad, but life is often unfair and sport is also bad.
It is never easy to ignore what enables a man to reach the top of his profession while another will never reach the lower level, sometimes by lack of opportunity more than by lack of ability.
There is only a cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end, judgment remains subjective.
Is it a good time to get Bopara out?
Is it just about Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which would choose between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both new managers who have obtained good diplomas, professionals, should be promoted: but there is only room for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the level of a cricketer unless he is given at least one chance?
The figures are important in decisions, but also opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketer must catch the captain's eye, at the same time take the door and a drummer must be lucky to touch the cricketer one day.
But catching the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many have done better last season, for example, James Anderson, who seemed to play the first test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself in full form and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors on 33 rounds to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have already lived their time of glory at the highest level and hope to offer yet more.
Whether it is Shah or Bopara who will play at Asgiriya stage, it is only a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man's career, but it doesn't make any difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and was successful in the first, with five doors and 40 useful towers, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also struggling to emerge, who managed to become the main cricketer of the Test, despite the fact that his double 100 marked against Australia in Australia could still be estimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and will promote Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, his brilliant and considerable beginning at the innings of Test 88 in Bombay, 32 cents of first class versus six for Bopara, who at age 22 is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at launch.
But Shah did only ten rounds during his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test in Lord, his Middlesex player city, and that, the immediate rejection by the voters when Vaughan was in shape again, claimed his place for the next match, seems to have affected his elans so obvious in Bombay.
Unlike him, Essex's player is full of joy to live.
Nothing frightens him on a cricket field and he exaggerated when he recently captivated a 4x4 during a presentation by Volkswagen, a sponsor of England.
He reported only minor injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor well on) and call Alastair Cook, his team who looked away, to ask him if "he had seen this?"
Bopara is far from the best drummer, his threading wings allow him to do services that go with him, and he fights with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing a just man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Could it be the true art of selection?
I would like to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as the tea sheets suggest, he will play this weekend.
Buses take people to work, and fight al Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, spilling these exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hoped that the city had found normal.
Some have come to fight the militants who have removed them from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people transported in dozens of official government bus convoys, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who were returned by their means.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing several doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and seeing that the city is safer now."
"They say that the Mahdi army no longer commits crimes!" he said, referring to Shia's militia of the ecclesiastical militant Moqtada al-Sadr, who forced his men to withdraw for the time being.
Qasim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher in the Amariyah area dominated by the Sunni, returned with her two children, because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevented the Iraqis from working.
His neighbors from Shia to Amariyah called on him to inform him that the United States-assisted militia allowed him to hunt Al Qaeda west of the capital, and invited him to return.
One of Jordan's new arrivals is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home north of Baghdad because of a grenade attack after he encouraged citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to come back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had set up an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys."
"That's why I'm coming in today," said 62-year-old Sabah Alu Obeidi.
Many say that they have been attracted by the growing accumulation of capital since the American troops arrived, and in the view of continuing training of well-armed "citizen groups" and working with US soldiers to defend their neighborhood.
But others say they have been forced to return because of the visa problem and the decadence of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years old, father of three children, expressed suspicion of all visas for exiles that Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, who would have asked the Syrian government to limit it to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people would have fled the country due to sectarian squadrons of death.
"We had no problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and encouraged the government to no longer give visas to the Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," Sunni retired.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned my house when I left."
The decline in violence can be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis have been chased out of Shia and vice versa, creating places where tensions are less.
It is feared that a sudden flow of refugees does not again increase sectoral tensions and bring fights back.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest federal State conducts vocational training, and shines even through the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Sarrois, that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest federal state, by self-reliance, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the training system of Sarre, which is the fifth in the German Institute of Economics of Cologne.
Thus, by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students have the opportunity to complete their studies with a double or a triple degree.
This shows the high level of 15.6 per cent of foreign students.
In addition, Sarre also leads children from the country to higher schools in a higher number than the average - many of them without a diploma in the high school.
"In Sarre, we take advantage of the vocational training system," says Axel Plünnecke, IW training expert.
More than one in five gets a degree in a vocational school, so Sarre is more than seven points above the national average.
The combination of vocational and academic training is also relatively well developed.
In view of the number of inhabitants, the double course panel is Germany's second best.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has decreased by one third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Education of Sarrois has forced higher schools to have a marketing campaign in engineering sciences.
"After the first PISA studies, we have celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," says a spokesperson from the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government has introduced all federal comparative tests.
For children to start learning earlier, the last year of crack is exempt from the law - a model that, in the meantime, other federal states also copy.
Only future comparative studies will be able to demonstrate whether the performance of students is improving in a sustainable manner.
In the PISA studies in 2003, the number of students at risk decreased from 29 to 20 per cent.
Overall, however, Sarre has not improved as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians get better off.
And in spite of the sarcasm, knowledge in foreign languages is not measured by PISA studies - otherwise we could gain points in this area.
Because the language of the neighbor is mandatory in the high schools - even though the sarcasm are not French.
Keep watches
In Venezuela, the watches will soon tic-tact otherwise than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will reset the time limit of half an hour in the South American country.
Chavez becomes a caricature in Spain in time.
As Venezuela's official newspaper reported, by means of a new law, watches will be set at least four and a half hours from universal time.
In this way, the South American country obtains a time zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
Anti-American Chávez justified his position among others by imposing on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the termination of relations with the neighbouring country, Colombia, due to a hostage case.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as the Conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would not have relations with the head of state or with the Colombian government.
"I can't, just because of my dignity," said Chávez, who is looking forward to a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote by Sunday's referendum.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The starting point of this dispute was the decision by Uribe to withdraw from Chávez the mandate of negotiations on the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have "screwed the face" of Venezuela with this decision, had criticised Chavez Sunday.
In Spain Chavez is also in all the mouths.
A new mobile phone ringing in the country: "Why don't you call" (why don't you cut yourself) is the phrase that already over half a million people have downloaded on the Internet.
It was pronounced by the King of Spain Juan Carlos, who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was upset by the constant interspecies of the left populists and who told him to fight.
A decline in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong situation, according to a forecast, a real less-value of wages threatens German employees this year.
Experts have cited all kinds of reasons to explain their prognostic pessimist.
According to the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees should expect a real reduction in their payroll compared to the previous year in 2007.
"The fault is due to low wage development, to an increase in value added tax and to increases in food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Circumstance Research, in the newspaper "Bill".
New charges could also be involved in unemployment insurance for the employee.
The Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the expected reduction in unemployment insurance of 3.3 per cent for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be in a position to ask the Federation of Credits or Financial Aid, according to the SPD politician.
On Tuesday, it was known that the explosion of food prices and hydrocarbons had increased the inflation rate at its highest level for 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 per cent from year to year.
Comes is the hellish twin of Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus is more like the Earth than we thought so far: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lights in the atmosphere and wind turbines at the poles, similar to those appearing in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that there are lights on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" today has given evidence of this - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the limit of the atmosphere: the lights on Venus shine up to a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous theory of Cyprus, the lights would have revealed life on Earth: the orage would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, an angle of life.
This is not the case on Venus: "If there was life, it must have been a very old date of history," explains Sean Solomon of the "Carnegie Institution" in Washington.
There should be little living things on the surface of Venus today: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, sometimes it has temperatures of 500 degrees.
"It may be the hellish twin of Earth, but it remains a twin," said Russell.
Why Venus, which is so much like the Earth in mass and dimensions, has been hit by such a different evolution, is the fundamental issue of the ASE mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in the search for Venus, as no more probes were on the way to exploring this planet since the 1990s.
According to researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several articles of "Nature" do not only highlight the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of our neighboring planet are more numerous than expected at first.
In addition to the wind turbines already known at the North Pole, researchers have found a cloud balloon at the South Pole, which rotates even faster.
The phenomenon recalls air currents in the Earth's hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Astrophysica Spasciale and Physics Cosmica.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The star-qualified planet of the night or the morning revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much slower on itself: a Venezian day lasts 243 land days.
Although Venus, with a surface temperature of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, does not recall the Earth, scientists assume that both planets have formed in similar conditions.
On both, the water has accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but has been lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on Earth as carbonate, it is the largest part of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany, Köhler, called for the end of the party's claim for the reception of Dalai Lama to the Chancellor.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPDs for attacks on the chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's appearance and the great chlorine coalition is calling for the reception of Dalai Lama.
"We must not present to the outside world a divided nation on this issue," Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, even if I respect the differences between cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knew that Germany should maintain a sensitive foreign policy balance, the President of the Federal Republic stressed, but defended Merkel against the allegations that it would organize a new policy of China.
The German chancellor did not take his distance with the traditional policy of one China.
"China also knows," Köhler said.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction with the reception of Dalai Lama and had been attacked for this outside the CDU ranks.
Steinmeier had complained, in particular, about the CDU's 'foreign policy' on foreign policy.
After receiving the Dalai Lama to the Chancellory, virulent irritations were felt in the German-Chinese reports.
Thus, not only did the Chinese government order German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD) but, according to Spiegel's information, it also froze the dialogue on the foreign ministers' strategy of the two countries.
The head of the Chinese government Wen Jiabao now demands from the German Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize that the welcome of the Dalai Lama was an error.
China refuses European political men to receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official functions, thus supporting Wen Jiabao's Chinese position.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama would show that it is attempting to separate Tibet from China and other Tibetan regions, including other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against emotions such as those of France.
Street fights with the police, shootings, fire cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots such as those of France.
All must be implemented so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not erupt in the streets by violence, the German Minister of the Interior has called for.
Barricades that burn, hunters who shoot at the police with hunting rifles: after the serious riots of young people in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is afraid of a similar evolution in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosive is not formed in our home as well and is torn apart in violence.
We must take this seriously," he said to the "New Press" in Hanover.
All young people would not be able to cope with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the Federal States and the Commons were already working closely to reduce problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"Integrating summits into the conferences on Islam, it already shows its first success."
But it would be too early for an end of the alert.
Schäuble points out in the same time as in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems, neither from the point of view of urbanism nor in France.
In the Parisian assemblies in the north, young people had engaged in serious street fights with the police during the last nights.
In Toulouse too, public cars and buildings burned.
Greater efforts to integrate the German government have been made to do this by the President of the Turkish Communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
Given the emotions in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would not be as explosive as in France.
But there would still be a need to act.
Kolat highlights the fact that the unemployment rate among young people under 25 years of age from immigration would be higher than the average.
First of all, more training places should be provided.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective."
However, the President of the Turkish Communities added that social control in families was more taking place in Germany than in France.
Many young immigrants do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat urged: "But we still have to be careful."
Young people should be "quickly given the opportunity to participate in work and training".
While waiting, in the Parisian faubourg of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very calm during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was flying over the area with projectors.
Posting authorities reported three arrests, as well as a few burned cars and trash.
Since the conference, a deployment of approximately 1,000 security forces ensures calm.
The police will intervene as long as it takes, announced the Minister of Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit by the Faubourg.
On Tuesday night, almost 80 policemen were injured during the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, the riots started in Toulouse.
Emotions erupted after a traffic accident in which two young people lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Parquet, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In the Empire of Angela Merkel.
The utopian entrance of the chancellor shows that the coalition has ended with the background - and there is nothing more to expect of it.
In which country does this chancellor live?
After his deplorable intervention in the general debate of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, it must be said that not here - in the country which should ultimately be governed by it.
The reproach of focusing too much on politics was rebutted by Angela Merkel of a harsh and suspicious phrase.
It's provincial, she said and only showed by that she doesn't want to understand what critics want.
In Parliament, it made clear to everyone the exact extent to which the complaint was correct.
There was no concrete interest or little feeling about the country's problems to be felt.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a politician in the press, who ran into foreign policy and who even remained there in the near future.
For example, climate protection: in this regard, it still welcomes the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how the climate objectives should be achieved in our country.
Even, the praise itself - having little modesty, the head of the CDU would have refused it two years ago.
Now it is grappling with formulas all over the world, that growth would affect people.
It destroys its image as a pragmatist, which solves problems rather than embellishes the world.
But in the realm of the Angela Cloud, internal policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Poverty in children and the concerns of low-wage workers?
He's got a few phrases left to him for that.
In this regard, the number of times it makes loopholes when it comes to family allocation is revealing.
Here, Merkel needs three starting points to make a half-specified sentence.
She's got a title in the unknown field, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the debate on Youtube's Republican presidential candidates, the two favors Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are delivering themselves to a tough offensive battle - and they must now fear a candidate outside.
The tension of the candidates is already on the first topic.
He would have made New York a "refuge for the clandestines", blames Mitt Romney to his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
On his side, he said, "I would say that his own house was a haven for clandestines," Giuliani replied and accused the former Governor of Massachusetts of employing undocumented immigrants.
Candidates are coming up against the attack: as the Republican base also has no official favour, the eight presidential candidates are mainly engaged in discussions on CNN to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that Internet users sent via Youtube are barely more than blowers.
"It is with this kind of isolationism that we have allowed Hitler to come into power," John McCain launches to his candidate Ron Paul who is the only one in the round to claim an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also learns the lesson vigorously by Vietnamese veterans, when he refuses to condemn as a torture what is called the Waterboarding, a method of interrogation where we simulate the nude.
However, the fact that the main themes of the campaign are interlocuting between time beyond the war in Iraq and the debate on torture is reflected in the reactions of the St. Petersburg Joint Chamber in Florida.
Whether conservative values are rented or future tax increases are refused, the applause goes down in the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favours are revealed once again.
"I made a mistake at this time," explains Romney, and presents his excuses to the base and the public on television for having still been a partisan of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, goes into a streaming knot when asked for his opinion on literary interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civil.
One day after his withdrawal as army leader, the Pakistani power man Musharraf was invested as president.
So eight years of military domination are over.
Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf was invested on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live to the Presidential Palace of Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and to act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had transferred his army chief's office to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, and had thus committed himself to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after taking power by a Putsch without bloodshed, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of civil status.
As a result of this withdrawal from the position of commander of the armed forces, Musharraf met the main challenge of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency decreed by Musharraf on 3 November.
Shortly after his investment, Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, thus fulfilling another Western requirement.
The Supreme Court of the country, which had occupied Musharraf after the establishment of the state of emergency with lawyers of its ranks, had rejected all appeals last week against the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of northern Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four other wounded.
According to the military spokesperson, a bomb exploded in a street near the Afghanistan border.
Krautrock's fathers are returning.
The German supergroups of the 1960s met: the three members of the Harmonia group again took their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return there are records of their great success "Live 1974".
By this time, they were much more known abroad.
The expected sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced at the evening poster.
Everyone has his little box in front of him, his cable and all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, sits in the middle in a white shirt like snow.
It is flanked to the left of Michael Rother, 57-year-old and has a laptop and a guitar.
On the right, observed by the entire auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, bends on his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, including a beat.
And sometimes it adds inadvertently to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the harmonia group is playing again has ensured for a few months among Krautrock's fans.
We have the right to disclose it here: targeted surveys reveal that, of course, the name is reasonable in the collective memory of the pop, but in no case is such a lasting one that this group has been suffering for 32 years.
But why wouldn't the German also have the right to celebrate his live legends of the '60s?
More and more than what is called the "Krautrock" trick has become more and more in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Award in 2003 to the survivors of the Cologne Can Group for their work, we saw in the room the German pop faces interrogator.
When the Red Hot Chile Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the Panegyrian slogan, the surprise was no longer limited.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the Red Hot Chile Peppers scene as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance in itself and the transformation into the unknown is the only and only.
The memory is therefore already taken by Harmonia, because the trio only existed for two years and that during this period, the impact power that felt was much lower than that which was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We played in the caves below the Berlin scene first.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a church-funded label, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly moved to Kraftwerk and had finally become a guitarist with Neu!, who was perhaps the most radical German group at the time.
About 1973, however, Rother followed Cluster's musicians in exile in Weserbergland's forests.
There, in an old Weser farm, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the community "Commune I", where Roedelius had the right to be tortured as a nun.
Rather an artistic existence in the way of Spitzweg.
So-called a fan of the Hormonia Ottenstein choral and also a name for art.
Many keep Harmony away from it.
The first album is called "Musik von Harmonia", and the next is "De Luxe".
Because the band suffered from material poverty as well as the sound of music.
The harvest of the dead wood did not serve to him alone in the quest for self.
The "Live 1974" CD that has just appeared was recorded at a concert in Griesem in front of a public record about 50 heads, as well as someone who believes to remember.
Rother released at this time the desire to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and will ensure its existence with albums such as "Flaming Herzen" (hearts in flames).
Cluster reanimates in the fourties and has been more successful than Harmonia has ever had.
We owe the live album from Griesem to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its label Greenland has set itself the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as a German contribution to contemporary music.
Snow! had already been destroyed on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place at the World Culture House in Berlin.
Publicly subsidized as part of the Wildtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, former punk and author of the "Krautrock Sampler" pocket book.
There's also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire fluctuation margin of Krautrock's influence would be clear with regard to future pop music.
The empty space left by the group will be completed by Harmony.
Brian Eno's phrase is in the middle of the singular sounds: "The only true music you listen to the future."
There are photos showing producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
The projections of other pictures in black and white of basar cabled tools serve the formation of the legend.
In front, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
But more by attaching microphones to the organ and battery, to draw the instruments of innovative sounds by means of instruments of self-constructed effects.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
The three in large technical fissures.
Even the choir of the house won't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we sneeze and sneeze under the cloud of sounds, and we sing at a beautiful moment "Aaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
He's never been rocking.
The roots were less sought in the blues than in the music conservatory (Can), in the technology (Kraftwerk) or in the escape of artistic or social conventions (cluster).
He who yells "68" is not completely wrong, and Harmonia is now no longer upset by this.
But what goes most of its own will be covered in detail on the stage.
Where does the music start and where does it end?
This can tap on someone's nerves (?) or give runaway moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Peace Killer", two films are again addressing the war of the Balkans.
But they don't convince each other.
Either the projects rely too much on action and foolish shootings or they are too tearsy.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: certain war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkans, but it's right there, in the backdrop of Bosnia's most lucid war, that actor Richard Gere was then found.
In the last place we lost the most beautiful man of the fourties, because too many nice and fuzzy roles in women's feelings films and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism have been a delight to him to show up.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at even "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunter (why do movies today have to be as long and confused as collective car drivers' conventions?)
He gives a wonderful representation full of eyelids: at the bottom, his character to report war Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if the fate and the film industry were not as charitable: a man who has his best moments since long ago, but who, even as a ruinous monument to his decline, has nevertheless preserved the visible remains of his former charm.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Peace Killer", which also comes out this week, the endless follow-up of films missed on the Balkan war.
The trial can be carried out quickly: the film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from the Kosovar snipers, in which one of the two remains soon to fall in love.
Although it is welcome that Serbs are not presented here for once as the only causes of all the evil, this film is as flat as a film is lost too quickly in action and the exchange of foolish shots.
This remains a sort of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but with a war in place.
On the contrary, we can look at the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why there has never been a real good movie on the Balkan war in the bottom.
The story of the three U.S. war reporters, who conditioned themselves to torture the top war criminal "the kidney", might have become, with another director and other screenwriter (both Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because stories look striking: two males go into a small team in the forest, to accomplish something military cannot do and for both males, it becomes a journey in madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we simply do not let Simon Hunt be the cynical desert with a heart, as he presented us at the beginning.
No, the script has to attribute to him more than a romantic adventure with a Bosniak killed afterwards.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when it is reported, in the last five minutes, by an accelerated process, that NATO, the CIA and all the world's prize hunters have failed in five years: capture the war criminal and leave him for a fair retribution to the Muslim Bosnians.
It is so bad that the International Criminal Court of the Hague should be sued against cinematographic logic.
In this case, the film has too much human concern.
He wants to complain that Karadzic and Mladic are still in freedom, and he suspects Americans and French (here they must exceptionally agree) not to drive the hunt in a sufficiently intensive manner because of secret political agreements.
But the intended good and the wicked are so similar this time that a famous poem by Brecht comes to our mind.
He speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the work table of the poet: "Compassionally, I see the veins of the inflated front, clearly: how it is tiring to be evil."
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such stubborn heads, but they indicate how tiring it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of movies on the Balkan war.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films on Iraq were big flops.
We can add: there have never been any good movies in South Africa.
This is true every time: when a star pulls on a house of crisis or a field of mines, it then comes out something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits gor Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
All these conflicts may still be too close in time.
Whatever the case, decades have passed before Hollywood can play a good movie on the holocaust with "The Schindler List".
Some films still need to be mature - those who today have classical works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have never been celebrated individually at their time as work leaders.
But maybe we know today just too much about the world's conflicts, where each hecatomb comes live on two screens at the same time at home,
And this delights the screenwriters the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
"Being or not to be" or "The dictator" have actually become so good because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know the extent to which the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Maybe you need to have a sarcastic artistic look away from the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Dictionary of Lemprière" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It only holds that certain things never change."
"The great cities will always be horribly dangerous, men will always be killed in a horrific way, and the war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust collects the criticism for the cancellation of the Olympics.
The resignation of the mayor with Hamburg's candidacy for the Summer Olympics was met with critical virulent policies and economies.
Many want to keep fighting for the Games on the water.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the assessment of chances.
The chief director of the Chamber of Commerce of Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described a abandonment on Wednesday as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project had deployed as many motivational forces in the city as the Olympics thought.
"Without this objective, the political-sporting momentum could not have been maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new longer-term starting point, "which takes as starting point another modified agenda".
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday to his previous statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"It's not Hamburg that decides to apply for the Olympics, but the German Federation of Olympic Sports," Von Beust said to WELT ONLINE.
It refers to the expected decision of the Federation of Sports in early December, on Munich's application for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means to us that, in the period of time that we had planned up to 2028, we will have no chance."
However, the dream does not ultimately belong to the past, Von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
This would give the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympics in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity by burying the projects already," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
An abandonment of the application would be more in contradiction with the statements of the Senate head on the occasion of the German Federation's plenary assembly of the higher schools of sport.
There, Von Beust would have qualified Hamburg for the 2015 Universities as "no substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of Higher Schools in Sport had first appointed Hamburg as a candidate city in the past weeks.
The mayor's SPD party accused the Senate of not using this valuable time in the construction of dwellings in Hamburg.
"The development of Little Grassbrook was rejected by the Senate for years because it played the Olympics card and excluded housing construction," said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always demanded for Petit Grassbrook an integrated plan in the Olympics and a later use of housing, the CDU would have placed exclusively on the "Event Factor".
The application for the Summer Olympics in 2012 would have been very enthusiastic for its part in Hamburg.
However, Hamburg had broken up against Leipzig.
They're not Warhols' boxes.
He who connects the Swedish concepts and falls into wood, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or what?
At the moment, wooden boxes made in Sweden cast shadows on Warhol's work list.
A large part of the twenty-four Brillo-Boxes of "Type Stockholm" listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxes a few months ago in 1968, Andy Warhol's internal research at the Moderna Museum of Stockholm has today come to a dissertation: the six "Brillo Boxes", whose former director of the Pontus Hulten Museum made gifts in 1995 at the Moderna Museum, are copies - as well as a large part of the other hundreds of Brillo Boxen of "Type Stockholm", which circulate on the international market of art.
The old history is intertwined, a decoupling chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, based on the red-and-white design of the "Brillo" powdered soap cartons in New York.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museum was presented in 1968 - with the Warhol agreement - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: these were not from Warhol (for financial reasons) but were delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
It was not art works here, but their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wood boxes in Sweden, which were not exposed to Moderna Museum.
Witnesses of the time speak today of about fifteen wooden boxes that would then be admitted right into the history of art and auctions, as the original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol authorized, with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them reached bids of more than $100,000.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum claimed, on the contrary, that after about a hundred wooden boxes had been produced and exposed in Sweden in 1968, Warhol would then surrender.
Indeed, the 105 boxes of Hultén were produced in Malmö only in 1990, for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the curator of the Moderna Museum, examined, alongside the six Brillo-Boxes of the museum, three other Swedish private collections, of which two were made in Stockholm in 1968: their stratified panels were first printed and punched, then applied with a brush of white oil painting.
The texture of the copies dating back to 1990 reveals the contrary that the painting was applied directly with no background layer on the stratified panels, with the help of a painting roll - it is no longer an oil painting, but an acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from Andy Warhol's official list of Brillo-Boxes," said Andy Warhol, director of the Moderna Museum, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not make another decision, the Moderna Museum will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exposure material."
Already in July, the Authentication Board has clearly announced that it would investigate the "heavy charges" that will be raised in the case of powdered soap boxes.
But since we've been there for an inexhaustible silence.
Manille's Rebel Soldiers Leave
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers left, the same ones who had retired in a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who accused the President of corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he could not respond to any bloodshed.
Faithful soldiers in power had just taken over the hotel with the help of lacrymogenic gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been in the building for hours.
About half of them held Wednesday before the courts due to an attempt by Putsch in 2003 - including Trillans.
He took advantage of the hearing to suddenly go off with about 30 sympathizers.
Military policemen, who normally had to monitor them, had apparently been deserted in his favor and joined his mutiny.
They arrived at the Hotel Pennsylvania and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The loyal troops in power sealed the area around the appropriate hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Office.
The National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who was in charge of the Scout Rangers elite unit, said that other military units wanted to join the march shortly.
Critics of the regime had called for a major protest against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by allegations of corruption.
The financial quarter of Manila was already the theatre of the attempt to mutiny about 200 members of the army against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurrection broke almost 24 hours after the army refused to join it.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven Putsch attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a main shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has secured more than 20 percent of the Versatel telecommunications company.
The average price per action is EUR 14.46, as the company announced on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 per cent of the social capital would be held.
We've already speculated on a purchase before.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versatel.
This does not seek to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet reported.
Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after Berenberg had increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institution would hold the money only for a third party, it is reported on the market.
The guard, the United Internet had already acquired a share of nearly 10% in the Drillisch mobile phone company.
As part of an increase in capital, Drillisch placed 17.4 million new shares in the Stock Exchange worth EUR 106.4 million.
United Internet purchased 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL products and mobile phones.
"We strengthen our partnership," explained a United Internet spokesperson.
The two companies founded the SME participation company in order to absorb the Freenet competitor.
For the time being, both companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent participation in Freenet, and do not use their right to raise 18.49 percent additional in Freenet, entrusted the United Internet on Thursday.
However, both companies would be left open to all options, in particular to increase participation in the SA Freenet, we learned.
The negotiations between the United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-October.
The still difficult predictable poker on Freenet that has lasted for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million customers linked to a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL clients and full subscriptions.
The Holding of United Internet and Drillisch so far held a direct share in Freenet of 6.01 percent.
It was now agreed that Drillisch would provide about four percent additional.
The right to purchase 18.49 per cent of Vatas' investment company had already been decided in August.
