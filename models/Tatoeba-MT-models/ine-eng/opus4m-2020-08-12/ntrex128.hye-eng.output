Members of the Wellsian Assembly were concerned that they would be viewed as “machinations ”
Some members of the Assembly are afraid of MWPs.
This proposal came from a change of plans to change the name of the Assembly into the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly are concerned that in the political field, they can become the object of ridicule.
One of the workers in the assembly said his group was unattached because "the name is tied to Twp and Pwp."
For those outside of Wells, in Welsh, twp means crazy, and pwp means crazy.
One of the members of the Assembly's Wells Party, Plaid Cymru, said the group was not happy and offered options.
A Welsh guardian also says that his group is "insensitive" about the name change, but he says that turning the pieces of the Welsh Parliament was a short flight of thought.
In this context, the letter Wellsian w (blue) is expressed as the letter u (u) in Yorkshire.
The Assembly of the Assembly, which is currently preparing to present the legislation on the name change, said, "The final decision on any title on the name of the members of the Assembly must, of course, be the work of the members.
Wells' government in 2017 gave Wells Assemble the power to change his name.
June: The Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, which was greatly supported by the election of the Wellsian Parliament.
With regard to the appointment of the Assembly (AMs), the Committee supported members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but MWP received the largest support from social consultation.
Apparently, the members of the Assembly are offering options, but the struggle to reach agreement can lead to becoming a president for Elle Jones, who will probably present the draft bill of change within a few weeks.
The legislation on legislative changes will also include other changes to the Assembly's working arrangements, including the rules for the decommissioning of members of the Assembly and the structure of the delegation system.
Members of the Assembly will get a final vote on what to call when the legislation is discussed.
The Macedonians began to raise public questions to change the name of the land
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the name of their country, the Republic of northern Macedonia.
It was planned that this well-known vote would end the ten-year dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its state called Macedonia.
Atheman has long claimed that his northern neighbour's name is a requirement for his territory, and he has reportedly addressed the EM and NATO for membership.
Macedonia's President Georgi Ivanov, the spokesperson for the name change, said he would cancel the vote.
However, the public supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zav, argue that the change of name is just a reward for joining the EU and NATO.
While the tension between churches began in Harlem, S. Martin's calls were silent
"The adults I've talked to say that historically, there was a coffee shop and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
- None of them today.
He said that the removal of the sanctuaries was understandable.
"In our time, people interact in different ways," he said.
The coffee shops are no longer considered neighboring guest rooms, where people regularly attend.
As for the churches, he is concerned that getting income from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will return from where they started."
"Churches," he added, "can be replaced by residential buildings of settlements, filled with people who won't help the remains of the shrines around them.
"The overwhelming majority of people who are going to go to these buildings will be white people," he said, "and will therefore accelerate the coming of the day when these churches will be closed, because it is unlikely that the majority of these people who are moving to these buildings will become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by white congregations, before the Metropolitan community in 1870, to become the black capital of Harlem, and ten years later St. Martin was built.
In the 1930s, the real white Methodist convention was pulled out.
The convention of blacksmiths, which was worshiping in the neighborhood, became the name of the building.
St. Martin was captured by black conventioners at the head of St John Howard Johnson, who was the leader of a number of boycott-denominated retailers on the 125th Street of Harlem's stores, and he was himself against the black people to take up work or encourage them.
In 1939, fire had a major impact on the building, but since Father Johnson's smokers had planned to rebuild it, they were assigned to make calls.
Saint David Jones, the son of Father Johnson and the successor of St. Martin's Church, calls the calls proudly "the calls of the poor."
The expert who made the calls in July called them "cultural treasure" and "unchangeable historical tool."
Professor Tiffany Ng of Michigan University also noted that it was the world's first call that black musician Dionysio A. Linde, who replaced the call in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Mereder said that S. Martin had not replaced him.
What happened around St. Martin's church in the last few months was a complicated story between architects and capals, some brought by church leaders, some on the Episcopal theme.
The Congregation of Leaders, the Church Leader Body, wrote on July, concerned about the issue of "turning away from expenses," even though the Assembly was not involved in the release of engineers and prisoners.
Some churchmen complained about the lack of transparency.
Snowflakes in California have damaged a 13-year-old boy who had snorted into the water to catch the nightmare
On the Sabbath, the shark attacked and damaged a 13-year-old boy who was tempted to catch the season in California, says an official report.
The attack took place until 7:00 a.m. near the bank of Ensinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB TV that he spent about half an hour with his friends in the morning listening to the boy's call for help.
Hammel said that he had at first thought it was just the excitement of catching the nightmare, but then he realized that he was shouting, "I've been kicked.
- I'm sick.
His arm was completely broken, said Hammel, and he only noticed it when he came to the boy.
"I'm proud of everyone to get out of the water." "There's a fish in the water," said Hammel.
The boy was taken by plane to a hospital in the children's hospital in San Diego, where his condition was very heavy.
The species of the infected whore was unknown.
At Mamuli's landing, rescue shipmaster Larry Gilles said that the fish had appeared in that area a few weeks ago, but it wasn't seen as a dangerous species.
Gils added that the victim had suffered tragic damage at the top of it.
The officers closed the entrance to the Asginian beach in 48 hours from Casablanca Ponto to Swam for research and security.
Gils added that there are more than 135 species of fish in that area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Seinsbury’s Plans Implanted in the British Beauty Market
Seinsber deals with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with the beauty of stores, with specialized assistants.
As part of an investment of 2.8 billion pounds of sterling in the British beauty market, which continues to grow when fashion and home sales are slow, large beauty halls will be tested in 11 stores in the country and more shops will be moved next year if they succeed.
The investment in beauty came to light when supermarkets started looking for ways to use televisions, microwaves and other household items.
Seinsber said it would be doubled to its size by offering for the first time up to 3,000 items of beauty, including such items as Revolon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing scientists from L'Oreal, Maybellin and Burt's Bees will also get a bigger area of burning as well as in Boots stores.
The supermarket is also reversing the theory of its boutiques, so that most products are of plant origin, which is growing demand for young customers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop, which deals with the retail of the anointing, will test the consensuals in two Seinsbury stores, the first of which was opened last week in Krydon, South London, and the second, last year in Shell Oak, Birmingham.
Online purchases, and the transition to local stores with a daily cut to buy a small amount of food, means that supermarkets have a lot to do to convince people to visit them.
Chief Executive Officer of Seinsbury, Mike Kupp said that commercial points would be seen as having wormholes, because the supermarket network is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl with more services and without food.
Seinsberni Argos (Argos) commercial points were placed in hundreds of shops, and he also introduced a number of Habitas brand theories, until he bought two networks two years ago, which, in his own words, increased the sales of material goods and made his profits more profitable.
The previous experiment on the supermarket -- its beauty and its pharmaceutical components -- failed.
Early in 2000, Sanesber tried to create a joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended with the argument about how to divide the proceeds from their supermarkets' medical stores.
A new war was created three years ago when he sold 125 million pounds of sterling to Lloyds Pharmacy, the owner of his 281 stores.
Lloyd was expected to play a great role in this program by adding four stores to the beautiful skin care theory, including such brands as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
We've transformed the shape of our beauty halls and have another meal, raising aesthetics for our customers.
We also made investments and made special partners who would be able to give advice.
Our theory of signs is designed to satisfy every demand, and the attractive environment, as well as the appropriate location, means that we are now a beautiful center of beauty, which in turn poses a challenge to the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones is "stolen" after a 11 million-pound business in Holly Wilba.
The Dragons Den television star, Peter Jones, remained "killed", when TV broadcaster Holly Wilbay came out of his life-style business with 11 million pounds of sterling to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Wilbay didn't have time to do household clothes and stuff, Truly.
The couple's business was similar to that of Guinness Peltroy (Goop).
This morning, a 37-year-old reporter announced her release at the Registry.
Holly Wilbay recently left the Dragons Den star with Peter Jones, and focused on his new, wide-ranging contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
The sources say that Jones was "sucking" when the golden girl on television, on Tuesday, in Marlowe, at the head office of his business in Bukinghamshary, announced 1.5 million pounds of sterling and more of his new business, which meant that he no longer had enough time to give his household clothes and stuff to Truly.
The business was similar to the Goop of Guinette Peltroy, and it was intended to replicate Willba's 11 million pounds of sterling in the future.
When 37-year-old Wilbay announced in the Registry that he was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain and traveled to one of his summers.
The source says, "Truly was the top of Holly's priorities."
It'll be his long future, which will keep him from seeing in the next few decades.
His decision to go out certainly left everyone in the lurch.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday -- it was so close to the operation.
There's a warehouse full of goods in Marlo's head that's ready for sale.
Experts are convinced that this morning's (This Morning) television broadcaster, who is considered one of Britain's richest stars, will receive millions for the company, from the tops and candles to the clothes and household investments, as well as from the drawings of future operations.
And that could mean the end of a long-term company.
The mother of three Wilbay children and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were in a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Kappa, for about ten years.
Wilbay founded Truly with Kappa in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones became president in March.
The husbands rest together, and Jones is the director of 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production.
Wilbay was going to become M&S trademark envoy and have to replace Ant McPartley as the I'm the star driver of the I'm A Celebrity.
Last night, Jones said, "We won't leave any comments about his business.
After a hard conversation, “we fell in love with each other”
He was laughing at criticisms that would be received for a comment from Mamul, which many would consider "no president" and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why is President Tramp so devoted?
The sound of the sound of the sound of “the messenger of the wise men ” praising him said: “I am going to make a helper for you, as a complement of you, and you will be objects of hatred by all the nations on account of my name. ”
- I didn't give up anything.
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting, when, after his first meeting in Singapore in June, the Tromp considered North Korea to be a major step forward.
But there were talks about counterfeiting.
More than three months after the Greek summit in Singapore, North Korea's highest diplomat, R. Yong Hong, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North did not see the "appropriate response" of the United States on the issue of the rapid military in North Korea.
Instead, he pointed out that the U.S. is continuing to apply sanctions to maintain targeted tension.
The tram gave a much more optimistic approach in his speech.
- We have a wonderful relationship with North Korea.
We were going to fight with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have these wonderful relationships, he said.
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had positive results: he had completed the torture trials, helped to free foreign students, and finally, the American soldiers came home.
And he kept his unusual approach to talking about relationships with Kim.
"As easy as being president, but outside, instead of having 10,000 people trying to enter this area, we're going to have about 200 people standing right here," said Trump, pointing out the crowd in front of him.
The tsunami in Indonesia and the earthquake destroy the island by taking hundreds of lives
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they no longer needed it.
Despite the fact that 10 percent of Lomboki's population had moved, there was no national counterpart that would be prepared for international relief.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, it's quite clear that they won't ask for international assistance, so it's a little complicated," said Mrs. Sambugg.
While the "Protecting Children" organization is collecting a team to travel to Pala, it's still not so sure that the foreign team can work in place.
A spokesperson at the National Disaster Relief Office, Mr. Sutopo said that Indonesian officials appreciated the situation in Palu, to see if international agencies would be allowed to perform welfare events, or not.
In view of Indonesia's constant shocks, however, the earth remains unprepared.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Akheh, they are not common for other shores.
In Palu, the apparent absence of a signal of tsunami and even a warning has probably contributed to human losses.
In the best case, travel is difficult between many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters -- the supply is much more complicated.
A medical ship in Lambok, which was providing help to those affected by the earthquake, has headed to Pala, but it will take at least three days to reach the new place affected by the disaster.
President Yoko Vidodon Indonesia's improvement of its unstable infrastructure has made its preferred promotion the most important condition, as well as spending money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funding concerns Mr. Yoko's government, because he will be elected next year.
Mr. Yocon also has problems because of media tension in Indonesia, where most Muslims have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, and more than 10,000 people have left their homes when Christian and Muslim groups fought in the street using weapons, guns, ammunition and other hard weapons.
Look, from Liverpool, Daniel Sterry made a match against Chelsea.
On a Saturday at the London Stanford Bridge Stadium, Daniel Strijs Premier Liga, against Chelsea's 89th minute, saved from Liverpool's defeat on an equal footing.
The bullet was received from Gedra Shakir, 30 yards from Chelsea's gate, when his team lost 1-0.
He moved the ball left before turning to the door.
The test stroke was a little bit higher than the door, because it went right over the top of the door.
Finally, the ball went down by Keppa Arizabalaga and entered the gate.
"I was just trying to get to that position to get to the ball, but players like Chess always get to as soon as possible, so I tried, as long as I could get to live," said Starridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
- I noticed Kante approaching, hit the ball a little bit, didn't even think about it, and I just got hit.
Chelsea won 1-0 when the 25th minute of the Belgian star, Ed Hazard opened the game account
In that game, while the attacker of Blaise would reach the center of the field, and he would write the Liverpool gate from the short space, the ball would send back to Mateo Kowachic.
The heater quickly went back and forth to the center of the field.
Then he hit the gate in the direction of Hizard.
The soldier came out of the defense and ended the attack on the left-hand end by handing the ball to Alison Becker in Liverpool.
On Wednesday, at 3:00 p.m., Liverpool plays with Neapoli at the stadium of the Champions League in the Italian city of Naples.
On Thursday, at 3:00 p.m. in London, Chelsea meets Videoton at the WEFA Europe League.
As a result of tsunami, the number of victims in Indonesia has increased to 832.
On Sunday morning, the disaster management agency announced that the number of victims in Indonesia had reached 832 as a result of the earthquake and tsunami.
At the press conference, the office secretary, Sutopo Puro Nugroo, announced that many people had appeared under the roofs of the buildings, which took place on Friday, with an earthquake of 7.5 balls, with an altitude of 20 feet.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was found beneath the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police suspected of stabbing and killing a woman arrested a 32-year-old man
The murder investigation started when this morning's wife's body was discovered in Birkenheid, Merissaid.
A 44-year-old woman was reportedly beaten with a knife at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Moose, John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested with suspicion of murder.
The police urged people who saw or heard something in the area to approach them.
Brian O'Haga said, "The investigation is in the initial stages, but I want to encourage all those who have seen it done or have heard something suspicious about John Bryanhead Street, to connect with us.
I'm addressing all, in particular, taxi drivers, who can fix something with video recorders, to connect with us in case they have very important information for research.
The police spokesperson confirmed the identity of the woman whose body was found at Birkenheid's house.
In the middle of the day, friends who knew the woman came to the scene to ask where they found them in the morning.
The investigation is continuing, because the police have revealed that they're in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver in Grayson City was trying to get back to his apartment, but the police said no one was allowed to come in or come out of the building.
He fainted when he found out what had happened.
People were told that it would take hours before they were allowed to return home.
A police officer told a man that the whole area is now being seen as a scene.
There came a woman crying at the top of the roof.
He kept repeating how terrible all this is.
In the middle of the day, at 2:00 p.m., there were two police cars inside, and another car outside.
A few cops were standing inside the coronation, watching the houses.
We ask every person who has any information about the incident, to call @MerPolCC in person, to call 101 or to give an anonymous call to the Crime Prevention Center at 080055111 on September 30, 247.
In parliament, the Kremlin peninsula, "rewriteing history" for the debate, becomes the last historic milestone
His expulsion will be a poetic justice as the destruction of the cultural and spiritual arts of the Taliban, by his corrupt Puritan followers.
But the Crimean Union described Mr. Crick's proposal as "stupid" and "trying to rewrite the story"
John Goldsmith, President of the Crimean Union, said: "The discussion of the removal of images now outside the Westminster Palace is inevitable to turn Oliver Kremlin's half-purpose.
The ideas of the civil wars in England have been very ordered, and they have not been invited by the Kremwell.
Maybe in the previous century, the wrong crime has been committed by the actions of his cousin Thomas.
The excellent presentation by Mr. William Hamo Tronicroft on crime is evidence of the 19th century's opinion and historical view, which many still admire.
Mr. Goldsmith told "Sunday Telegraph."
Whether it's completely accurate or not, it's subject to continuous historical discussion.
It's remarkable that the conflict in the mid-17th century has shaped the future development of our nation, and the cremation is an individual well-known character that represents one side of that division.
His achievements as guardian are also worthy of appreciation and remembrance.
A killer pig brutally kills a Chinese farmer
China's local mammule reports say there's a pig attacked and killed in the southwestern market.
South China Morning Post reports that on Sunday, a man named Yua was found in a dead state in the Liupanishi market in the Gulf of Gichou, where he was killed and completely covered in blood.
The village was about to slaughter pigs in China's Kiningy King's Fall on May 30, 2005.
On Wednesday, she and her cousin went to the neighboring Yuna dormitory to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the next door was open.
And he said, There was in the swine man's mouth great with blood.
According to the report, the trial found that a pig weighing 550 pounds had killed the farmer.
"Guiyang Evening News," he quoted as saying, "My cousin's knees were bloody and broken," "You" said the nephew.
The security cameras fixed Yuna's entrance to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed her pigs.
His body was discovered an hour later.
The animal that killed John didn't belong to him, neither to his cousin.
Suka's boss told Erecoya News that the pig was being hunted so that he wouldn't attack anyone until the police gathered evidence from the scene.
The June family and market management are discussing the compensation for his death.
In the past, there have been rare cases of an attack on a person by a pig.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their own farm, leaving a man with critical injuries.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 650 pounds on a tractor came across a Welsh farmer, until his wife was able to escape from the animal.
In 2012 in Oregon, the peasants ate their own pigs.A farmer from Manitoba told CBC News: "The pigs are not usually violent, but the blood taste can "draw them."
They just like to play.
They're like kids, very interesting... they won't hurt you.
You just have to pay attention to their exact amount.
The remnants of Potoric Rosa will bring abundant rains to the south-west of the United States
As predicted, moving the North Coast of Mexico on cold waters, Rosa storms are guilty.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring abundant rains in northern Mexico and in the south-west of the United States.
On Sunday morning, at 5:00 o'clock o'clock o'clock o'clock o'clock o'clock o'clock o'clock o'clock o'clock o'clock o'clock o'clock o'clock o'clock o'clock o'clock o'clock.
It's expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
At the same time, the Pacific is beginning to form a river, and it's starting to move from the east coast to the west coast, because on the second day of the week, Rosa is going to approach the Baja California Peninsula as a sunset wind from the north of the United States, which will bring south humility.
On Monday, Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Then the sun's tilt, transforming it into a stream, will produce abundant torrential rains in the south-west in the coming days.
Locally, 1-4 inches of rain can cause floods, earthquakes, and possible floods.
The grass will cause the sun's revolving humility in an hour of 2-3 inches of rain, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the south-west is expected to be 2-4 inches of rain, especially in the large part of Arizona.
It's possible to have a flood in a state of extreme deterioration, in relation to the nature of the sun's rain.
It's going to be a terrible bad advice to walk in the wilderness, in the vicinity of a rainstorm.
The torrential rain can make rivers, and clouds will bring strong winds and dust.
The approaching waters will cause heavy rains in the coastal areas of Southern California.
Half a dozen rains may be the cause of the flow of small caverns and the flood of roads.
This is going to be the first massive rain of this humble season.
On Sunday evenings and on Sundays, some sun-draining rains will begin to approach Arizona before the rain will become more common on Sundays and Wednesdays.
On Tuesday, the rain will spread in four angles and continue until Thursday.
In the U.S., in October, you can see some intense fevers, because the Arctic part gets colder, but the solar part remains pretty hot.
Sometimes this can cause severe temperature changes in short distances.
There's a good example of temperature-critical changes in the Central U.S. on Sunday.
There's about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and De Muni.
In the next few days, the long summer heat will try to spread again.
In October, in the central and eastern parts of the United States, there's a soft start from the south-east (about 80 degrees) to the north-east.
On Tuesday, the temperature in New York can reach 80, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
According to our long-term forecasts of climate, there's a great chance that by the first half of October, there's going to be a higher average in the east of the United States.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Cavanau’s hearings
On Thursday, more than 20 million people were watching six televisions at the Brett Cavanau and Christine Blais Ford trial, which accused him of a sexual harassment in the 1980s.
However, political resistance continued when the broadcasters stopped regular telephony at the end of Friday, Senator Jeff Blake of Arizona agreed that the Bureau of Investigations (FBI) should carry out a one-week cost check.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that he was 100 percent convinced that Cavanau had drunk on him and tried to take off his clothes at the school's graduation party.
Cavanau was thrilled to see 100 percent convinced that it wasn't.
As Nielsen reports, probably more than 20.4 million people saw it on Friday.
The company calculated the average number of views according to CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks that showed that indicators were not immediately accessible, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
But Nielsen usually has some difficulty in calculating the statistical numbers of people watching from the office.
The number of viewers from this point of view is equal to the number of football games or the number of Academy Awards.
Fox News, whose public opinion guests have shown strong support for Cavanau's bid, is the most advanced in all networks -- the average of 5.9 million viewers a day -- says Nielsen.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million observers.
CBS had 3.1 million -- NBC -- 2.94 million -- MSNBC -- 2.89 million -- and CNN -- 2.52 million -- says Nielsen.
After the trial, the interest remained at a high level.
On Friday's tragedy, Flake was in the central role.
After a vote in favor of Cavanau's office, the CNN and CBS videocassettes were sent to the complainants on Friday afternoon when he was trying to raise his voice in the hearing room of the Judicial Committee.
At the time of the direct broadcast of CNN, he was standing for a few minutes, staring at the ground because he was going to feel suffocated.
-I'm standing right now for you.
- Do you think he's telling the truth on earth?
They said to him, "You have power when many women are weak," said one woman.
Flake said his office had spread a message and before closing the elevator doors, he said there would be much more to say at committee hearings.
All cable and television networks made direct broadcasts later when the Judicial Committee had to inform the Senate of the invitation to vote on the election of Kavanu.
But Flake said that he would do it only when he realized that the FBI was going to investigate the charges filed next week by the student, which required a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced of his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Kuns.
After Consy and several other senators spoke to him, Flake made his decision.
The flag's choice was strong, because it was clear that the citizens of Cavanau would have no vote without the investigation.
President Trump has begun an investigation into the FBI -- part of the charges against Cavanau.
British Prime Minister May, for Brixit's sake, accuses "a political player" of criticism
In his interview with Professor Teresa Maye on Sunday Times, he accused his plans to get out of Europe, as well as to hit national profits -- "a political player."
On September 29, 2018, British Prime Minister Teresa May arrived at Birmingham, Britain, to attend the Constituencies.
On the first page of Third, in another interview with him, former author Boris Johnson expressed his dissatisfaction with his so-called Brexit's investigators' plan, presenting his proposal that Britain and the EU join their forces to be "jumped up."
The fire on Wade Sims, the police arrested Dayton Simpson, a suspect in the death of a LPH player.
Police have arrested the suspect -- a 20-year-old LPH basketball player -- with suspicion of shooting Wade Sims.
According to Baton Rugh's police department report, 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for a second-degree murder.
The video of Sims and Simpson's situation has been officially published, and as the police say, in the war, Sims lost his sight.
According to CBS, in a WAFB report, the police have found the eyes from the scene, and they've discovered Simpson's DNA.
After asking Simpson, the police said he confessed his sin.
According to the lawyer's statement, his bill was $35,000.
On Saturday, the Eastern Baton Rugh District Attorney's office published a preliminary report saying that the cause of death was the gunshot fired on the head.
The department expresses its gratitude to the State Operative Group of the Luizian Police, the Criminal Police State Laboratory, the Southern Police University and the local population for supporting the investigation into the arrest.
With the LPH's political leader, Jo Aleva thanked the region's right-wing forces for their "work and pursuit of justice."
Sims was twenty years old.
He was very tall and grew up in Baton Rue, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball in LPH.
In the past world he earned an average of 5.6 units and 2.6 units.
On Saturday morning, LPH coach Will Wade said the team is "suffering" and "shocking" from Wade's death message.
"That's what's always bothering you," said Wade.
The frog spread its brownish - brown smoke to Mexico
The popocatepetl eruption caused the smoke to reach the southern regions of Mexico's capital.
On the Sabbath, the National Disaster Management Center warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano during the increase in activity in the desert and within 24 hours after recording 183 types of gas emissions.
The center was controlling a lot of thunderstorms and shocks.
In the social media, pictures from Mexico's neighbouring district of Joachimilco show a soft layer of smoke that covers the fronts of cars.
As early as September 2017, the center of Mexico was hit by a 7.1-balloon earthquake, the archaeologists, from the capital to the south-east, saw an activity near the volcano at 45 miles (72 km) away.
Don Goo's volcano has been active since 1994.
Conflicts between police and Catalan decommissioners were preceded by a year of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on the Sabbath, when the independence protestors met the police, and thousands of people joined the anti-insectors to celebrate the first anniversary of Catalonia's independence.
A group of police-responsive decommissioners were pushed back into the streets, and they were huddled up with eggs and scissors, leaving dust clouds in the streets, and they were constantly worrying about the visitors.
Later, in the morning, the clashes with the police began, and they used the police to fight for the government back.
In a few hours, the groups fighting for independence, singing "Don't forget, Don't forgive," met with the democratic defenders, who were shouting "Living in Europe, Spain."
According to local media reports, fourteen people who suffered minor injuries in protest have been treated.
The tension in the area of independence had increased a year ago when Madrid was declared illegal on October 1st, but was celebrated by disabled Catalans.
The overwhelming majority of the electors will vote for independence, although there was little presence in the circle of those who voted against the vote and voted very strongly against the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, more than 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when the police tried to put an end to the vote.
On Saturday night, the independence groups came out to prevent the national police.
There was a win, but the show had to take another direction.
68-year-old electrician Narcissus Hermes, who was taking part with his wife in the protest against the disabled, said that he no longer saw any hope for Catalonia's independence.
- Last year we lived one of the best moments of our lives.
I saw my parents crying with joy, because they could vote, but now we're buried," he said.
In spite of the severe presidential victory in the December regional elections last year, the Catalan independence parties were fighting to keep the signal this year, along with their best leaders who were imprisoned or imprisoned, as a result of independence and subsequent independence announcements.
42-year-old mechanic Juan Puig, who was recording a complaint to support the police on his phone, said that the conflict was prompted by political actors on both sides.
"Temperature is getting tighter," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Juncker, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in the primary court since last year, announced that next year he will take part in the elections of the European Parliament.
"Being a candidate for European elections -- the follow-up to the democratic values seen by the Spanish government's committee -- is the best way to condemn pressure," he said.
Londoners: Men arrested after the car hit the house
33, 34, and 39-year-old men were arrested when the car in London was hit by the house several times.
This happened on Thursday, at the time of the local Belingard Cruscent at 19:30.
Seer Bob Blemings of the department said he was damaged by the doors and the building itself.
Maybe a cross has been damaged in part by a car crash.
In the games with Rangers, Menga's 1-0 hit won at Livington
The first goal of Dolly Mengane was to win at Livington
In fact, Livington's advance confused Rangers, transferring Stephen Gerard to the head of the Ibrox Club, as the cause of his second defeat in 18 games.
The Dolly Mengan hit, as if it were different from Gary Holt, reaching the second level of Hebron.
This Prime Minister League's side of Gerard's game was evicted from victory, and the next Sunday, they meet with the Best Map, 8 of which are left alone.
By then, on Thursday, Rapid Vienna had hosted Rangers in the League of Europe.
LIVINGSTON, who continued his invincible race with Chief Coach Holt in six games, was losing so much until last month's coach was replaced by Kenny Miller.
LIVINGSTON SHOULD LEAVE HIS OPPORTUNITIES IN THE CONTRACTS OF ASSISTANCE.
Before you hit the goal, Holt's team was supposed to be in front of them right away, causing multiple problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson went ahead, but he didn't spare any effort to score, and then Alan Litgon was able to direct all his efforts towards a wide-ranging hit, meeting with Craig Holbert's head hit.
The acceptable side was pleased to let Rangers play in front of him, knowing that they might be concerned about visitors in certain areas.
And that was just the way the decisive goal was hit.
Rangers had a free shot, and LIVINGSTON was working towards the opening of the account, and Dean Gallagher and Robinson were trying to bypass Menga, who took the ball and hit the gate from the center.
At this stage, Rangers had a dominant position, and the protection of their doors was invulnerable, and Liam Kelley's doorkeeper was invincible.
The game was preserved until the second play, even though Alfredo Morelos broke Kelly's safety.
Scott Pittman was hit on foot by Rangers' doorkeeper Alan McGregor, and Ligon was another player in Livington.
After two strokes, one of which was replaced by Holketti by Glam Middleton, the other by hand, the cross-attacks at the Lewiston gate continued to move back and forth.
- It was a phenomenal analysis by LIVINGSTON.
Alasdir Lamont for a report by the Scottish BBC from Tony Mackron's blood
It's an unlikely game and a result for LIVINGSTON.
One man said, "They're great. They're going to be great.
After moving upstairs horizontally, their playing style and the composition of the players has changed significantly, but it's worth a lot to Holt, because after his arrival, the team has been resuscitated.
He has so many heroes.
Captain Halktet had done a great job of building a powerful defense, while Menga was closely following Connor Goldson and Joe Worley.
However, Ranger's inspiration was short-lived.
As good as they were playing with Gerard, they didn't fit the standards.
Their last absence of the ball and the annual opening of their side were a wake-up call for Rangers to appear in the middle of the playground.
Erdalan was accepted in Cologne
There were blue and blue clouds on the Sabbath (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of the opposite visit of President Erdalani to Germany, which was aimed at regulating relations between NATO partners.
They discussed a number of issues, including the rights of people, the freedom of mamuli and the entry of Turkey into the EU.
And then Erdalan went to Cole to participate in the opening of a huge mosque.
This city is home to a large Turkish population living outside Turkey.
The police had obtained security tools to close the entrance of the 25,000-hour crowd, but a lot of supporters were able to see their president closely.
Hundreds of anti-Effect Protestants, many of whom were deaf, also heard their voice condemning the politics of Erdola, and accepting the decision of the German government in the country.
The burning protests were reflected by some German Turks, the incompatibility of the visitor as a hero, and the self-declaration.
There was a car on the road to Deftford, and a motorcyclist died in a car accident.
In London, a motorcyclist died with his car.
The storm took place at 10:15 a.m. on the heavy road in Deftford, south-east of the city, in Bestwood and Evelyn's street crossing.
The driver stopped, and in front of the witnesses, the man died in the scene.
There was a storm on Childers Street, about a mile from the break of the day, about a month after the death of another biker.
The police in the capital say they're working towards identifying a man's identity and informing his relatives.
The road is closed, and the direction of bus traffic has changed, and drivers are encouraged to avoid that area.
Long Lartin prison has been damaged by riots
As the prison office reports, six soldiers were injured in a man's prison sentence in a hard-to-man regime because of irregularities.
The riots took place in Long Larty, a long prison at work, local time on Sunday at 9:30 a.m., and are still going on.
The Tornado team of Sparrows was brought in to eliminate irregularities -- eight prisoners from the same wing were involved.
The spas were treated for minor facial injuries instead.
The prison service spokesperson said, "Long Lart's prison has been brought to a special prison staff to calm down the ongoing interface.
Six people have been treated.
We can't tolerate any violence in our prisons, and it's clear that those responsible will be arrested and spent a long time behind bars.
Long Lartine has more than 500 prisoners, including some very dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was receiving hospital treatment as a result of an attack by the prisoner.
And in October of last year, they called on the terrorist soldiers to eliminate the serious crime, in which they attacked the people with floating bullets.
Pottoric Rosa threatens the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (places of refuge can be of benefit)
For the solar cyclone: Arizona damage is rare, but that's what's probably going to happen at the beginning of the next week, because the remaining energy of the Rosa storm is going to hit the Southwest desert, which could be the cause of the flood.
It's just that the Department of National Forecasts has already looked at the possibility of a flood on Monday and Wednesdays, from West Arizona to South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Yuta, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It's expected that on Tuesday, Rosa will take her way to Phoenix, approaching two weeks later, in the evening with rain.
The National Assembly of Phoenix on Twitter noted that "from 1950 to 200 million Phoenix, only ten solar cyclones have preserved the state of the sun's revolving winds.
In 1967, Katrina’s storm was moving 40 miles [40 km] to Arizona’s border.”
The latest models of the Center of National Storms predict a total of 2 to 4 inches of rain, up to 6 inches of individual rain in Arizona's Magolom.
The other areas of the Southwest desert, including Rock and the Great Basin, are likely to get 1-2 inches of water, possibly four inches apart.
For areas that are safe from the flood, Rosa can be a blessing, because the area is at risk.
Although the flood is a serious concern, these rains are likely to be useful to Southwest, which is now under threat.
According to the U.S. Weather.com report, "As a result of the massive surveillance of Erasht, Arizona is under 40 percent of the risk of a major threat to the previous category."
From the beginning, the stormy Rosa route leads from the Bay of Mexico to the beach.
In the morning of Sunday, Rosa's still strong, at 85 miles of maximum wind, 385 miles south of Ponta Eugenia in Mexico, and at 12 miles/hour, she's moving north.
The wind is rubbed by the cold waters of the Pacific, and so its power is strengthened.
So it's expected that there will be a place in Mexico at noon or at midnight, due to a rising sun.
In some parts of Mexico, the rains will be abundant, which can also cause a severe flood.
As weather.com reports, "3-6-inch rains are expected from Baya California to the north-west Sonora, possibly up to 10 inches."
Then Rosa will split northern Mexico as a solar wind until she reaches the Arizona border on Wednesday morning, and then she will split Arizona on Wednesday night and reach South Jutta.
"The greatest danger facing Roses or its remnants is the massive rains in Baja California, in Northeast Sonora and in the Southwest desert of the United States," says the Center of National Storms.
It's expected that these rains will lead to life-threatening floods and floods in the desert, as well as floods in the mountains.
The attack at Metsomer Norton — four persons arrested in Morphor.
A three-year-old and a twenty-year-old man was arrested with a suspicion of death after finding a 16-year-old boy in Somerset.
On the Sabbath, about four o'clock local time, they found a boy in an injured state in the area of Exelsior Teresa, located in Mitsomer North.
He was transferred to a hospital where his condition was assessed as "stable."
Eiven and Somerset's police report that 17-to-twenty-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested in Redstock on the same night.
The police have called for all the people who might have made a phone call to get to them quickly.
Tramp says Cavano Democratic Party has become "a victim of humiliation, anger"
"To vote in favour of Judge Kavana means to vote against the unfair and unfair struggles of the Democratic Party," said Trump at a public gathering in West Virginia City.
The tram says that Kavana has become the "sacrifice and victim of anger" of the Democratic Party throughout her engagement.
On Thursday, Kavana witnessed in front of the Congress in a rigorous and emotional way rejecting the unwarranted accusation by Christine Blass' Fundo that he had been sexually assaulted by him years before he was a young man.
Ford also testified during the trial, after hearing about his charge.
On the Sabbath, the president said, "The Americans saw the wisdom, characteristics and courage of Cavan that day.
The vote to elect a judge in Kavana is the vote that elects one of the most educated and legitimate thinkers of our time, with a clear knowledge of social services -- he has announced to the West Virginia party.
In the mid-elections, the president spoke of the stand-up of Kavana when he was talking about the importance of the public assembly.
-The most important choices in our life have been five weeks.
I'm not, but I'm actually.
That's why I fight so hard for good candidates, he said.
The tramp claimed that the democrats have a task to "remove and resist."
The representative of the government of the old party (the government of the public party) told CNN that the first major elections in Kavana are to be held in the Senate not later than Friday.
Hundreds of people have become the victims of an Indonesian earthquake and tsunami together.
The authorities reported that at least 384 people had been killed by the massive earthquake and tsunami that took place on the island of Sulawesi on the Sabbath, and many had been driven by the massive waves that hit the swimmers.
Hundreds of people had gathered in one of Palu's beaches to participate in the festival on Friday, when six meters (18 feet) of wave struck the girl on the beach and took the children of men with her, destroying everything that was on her way.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-ball earthquake.
During the interview in Jakarta, the representative of the Indonesian BNPB's mitigation company, Sutofo Puro Nugrohon, said that on the evening when the alarm of the tsunami rose, people continued to swim and instead fled from where they became victims.
--TUNAM DIDN'T COME TO HIM, IT KILLED WITH HIM CARS, HOUSES, HOUSE, IT KILLED EVERYTHING ON THE EARTH, -- said Nugrohon, adding that until the beach encountered the tsunami at 800 km/h (497 m/h) speed.
Some people have raised trees to protect them from the tsunami and they're still alive," he said.
About 16700 people were displaced in the 24 centers of Palau.
The ambers in the photos of an organization photographed from the air show a lot of ruined houses and shops, ruined bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The seizures continued to take place in coastal areas on the Sabbath.
In an area of 2.4 million people have also been affected.
In a statement by the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Organization (BPPT), the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on the cities of Jerome and Nagaska in World War II.
It's said that the city's geographical position, which is at the edge of a long, narrow seaport, could have increased the size of the tsunami.
The damage caused by Newgrohon has been estimated to be "great" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
Some victims' bodies were found under the roofs of buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugrohon said that the victims and casualties could have been larger in the water cycle 300 km from Palu to the north of Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
The communications in Dongala were "absolutely lacking in information," Nugrohon said.
The Red Cross said in a statement that there are more than 300,000 people living there, adding that the personnel and volunteers were heading for damaged areas.
It's said it's a tragedy, but everything could have gotten worse.
On Sunday, the organization received great criticism because it did not know about the tsunami in Palu, although the soldiers said the waves had reached the time when the warning had not yet arrived.
A love recording that's on the Internet, it's said that the man in the list is like a loud warning to the people on the street below.
In minutes, the water wall comes across the beach, taking up buildings and cars.
The Reuters office was unable to verify the audio recording at once.
Earthquake and tsunami have caused a huge amount of tension, which has made it impossible to communicate around Palau, and in turn has made it difficult to send coordinates to the government's rescue forces.
The authorities say the army from Jakarta and other cities has started sending help from trucks, but the displaced people still need food and other basic needs.
The airport of the city has only been rebuilt for the auxiliaries, and will remain closed until October.
President Joco Widodo has planned to visit the different centers of Palau on Sunday.
- The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia is over 800.
It's very bad.
Until the staff of the World Vision staff of Dongala's World Vision arrived safely to Pala, where the workers were sheltered in the vaulted enclosures of their offices, they saw visions of destruction on their way, said Mr. Dosebana.
They told me they've seen a lot of ruined houses, he said.
It's very bad.
Even when the relief groups began to install disaster relief devices, some complained that the foreign relief team's employees, who were better informed about it, had banned Palu from travelling.
According to Indonesian rules, financing, helping, and accepting a workforce can only begin if the disaster area is known as a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's still considered a state-level disaster," said Ulia Ariana, "the mamlo of the Indonesian Red Cross.
The government itself says, "Good, this is a national disaster," we'll be able to get international help, but we still don't have the right.
The second night in Palu after the earthquake on Friday and the tsunami, the families and friends of the deceased were still hoping that their loved ones would be the wonders that had gone tragically because of natural disasters.
On the Sabbath day, they took a young boy out of the camp.
And on the sabbath they brought out a woman that had been delivered into the hands of their mother for two days, after her mother's body.
Jend Subandonon's Indian National Paraplaning Team coach trained two of the lost paraplanists in an Asian match that took place in Indonesia earlier that month.
The rest of Roa Roa's hotel, Mr. Mandag's nephew, were students.
"As a paraplaning expert, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Jenden tells us how he, after hours of news in the paraplanists' community about the breakdown of the Roa Roa Hotel, sent desperate messages with WhatsApp to Palu's competitors who were taking part in the swim party.
But his messages were given only one grey check in place of two blues.
"I think it indicates that the messages have not been reached," he said.
The thieves in Newport Levi have spent $26750 on filling the bank account.
According to news from the Newport police, on Friday morning, the thief was robbed of $26750 from a Branca employee who collected a banker in Newport Levie.
The car driver emptied the ATM in the fun suite and was about to get more money to Detroit, Dennis McCartin wrote in the essay: “I don’t know how much money to pay.
While he was busy with it, another man fell behind Brian's colleague and wrapped up a bag of money that he had to send.
According to the witness, he's seen a couple of suspects run off, but the police haven't indicated how many people have participated in the incident.
People who have any information about their identity can contact the Newport police with a telephone number of 859-292-3680.
Kanye West, Reper changes his name to the web.
Reper Cany West changes his name to the e-mail.
And when he announced the change on Twitter on the Sabbath, he wrote, "Really known as Kanye West."
Forty-one-year-old West has been wearing Je's handkerchief for some time and has adopted it as his eighth album title, which he saw in June.
The change succeeds on the day of the Sabbath if it was right at night, where he should have seen his new album, Yandi.
- He replaced Ariana Grande, who considered something "cause of emotion" to be invalid, during the talk, said the organizer of the show.
In addition to being the nickname of his present name, Weste has said that the word has religious significance for him.
"I think "yes" is the most popular word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," earlier this year, West announced the title of his album with Big Boe's radio reporter.
So, it's you, it's us, it's us.
It's spread out from Canada, which only means Y's, and it's become our good, bad, confusing reflection of everything.
The album reflects more of our real self.
He's one of the famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Cobbs was well known as Puff David, P.D., or D.D., but this year he announced his preference for "Ser" and "Ser" names.
JJ-SIN, who was a former singer with West, also wrote his name in or without a line and letters.
Mexico's president, Andrés Manuel Loc Obrador, has sworn not to use the army against the citizens.
Mexico's elected president, Andrés Manuel Loc Obrador, has sworn never to use military forces against citizens, because the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of the bloody revenge against students.
On a Saturday at the Talteloko complex, Like Obrador promised never to use military forces to pressure Mexicans.
On October 2, 1968, at a peace show, the armies set fire to nearly 300 people, when the left-wing movement of students was widespread throughout Latin America.
As the Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by giving a monthly contribution to those who learn, and by setting up more free universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of education make it possible for young people to become members of a criminal group.
The U.S. needs to double the funding of artificial intelligence.
"While China is also more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. has to replicate the money it spends on doing research work in this field," says investment and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
There's only one case after the various parts of the U.S. government have made announcements about artificial intelligence, while the U.S. itself has no formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
At the same time, last year, China presented its programme -- their goal is to become the first in the field of artificial intelligence in 2030.
"Replication of the artificial intelligence research budget is a good start, given that the US is quite advanced from other countries, and we expect the next progress in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
During this week's interview, Lee CNBC has announced that refinancing can double the next major achievement that the US will achieve in the field of artificial intelligence.
They are the Chief Executive Officer of the Synovation Ventures, whose book "The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence -- China, Silicone Dašta and New World Order -- was published this month by Hut Miffly Harcourt, who invested in one of China's most popular artistic intelligence organizations, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at the University of Carnegie Melon on an artificial intelligence program that won the highest-ranking American performance, Otello, and then became Microsoft Research CEO and the President of the Chinese branch.
Lee accepted the challenges of the U.S. former government's technology competitions, such as the Challenges of the Organization for the Protection of Research Projects and asked when the next one would be to help discover the next developers.
- U.S. researchers often have to work a lot to get government money.
"It takes academic leaders, not China, but corporations," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology organizations have been recruiting well-known experts from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that the change in immigration can also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think I should offer a letter to the doctors of the philosophy of artificial intelligence immediately," he said.
In July 2017, the National Council of China presented its next generation's programme for the development of artificial intelligence.
"China's National Foundation for Natural Sciences funds academic institutions such as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations for U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China," he said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up a Joint Arts Intelligence Centre, which is designed to include colleagues from industrial and academic fields, and the White House announced the formation of the Choice of Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that $2 billion has been invested in a venture called "AI Next."
As far as NSF is concerned, it's currently investing over $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, the U.S. legislation, which seeks to create an artificial intellectual security committee, has not done anything over the months.
Macedonians Celebrate “Renew the Earth ”
On Sunday, the Macedonians voted in public when they voted on the need to change the name of the country, "The Republic of Northern Macedonia," a step that would help resolve the ongoing disagreement with Greece, which was an obstacle to its membership in Europe and NATO.
Greece, which has a state called Macedonia, claims that wearing that name from its northern neighbour means that its territory has been invaded and has banned its entry to NATO and Europe.
The two governments signed a new name in June, but national opponents argue that the change will destroy the ethnic dignity of the majority of Macedonian slaves.
President Georgie Ivanov has announced that he will not vote, and the boycott publishers have doubts as to whether the participation would be at least 50 percent needed to meet the requirements for public approval.
The question of the public ballot is, "Do you agree with NATO and Europe's membership and the accession of Greece?"
Reformers, including Prime Minister Zawa, argue that this is the price of becoming a full member of NATO or Europe for Macedonia, which is one of the countries that has survived the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came to vote for a good future under the care of Europe for the future of the country's youth," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgeskana in Skopje.
Although it's not legally binding, enough council members have said that they will remain opposed to the results of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name requires the majority of the board's total 2/3 voices.
The election committee said that there was no report of irregularities until an hour ago.
But the vote was 16 percent, compared to 34 percent of the 2016 elections, when 66 percent of the registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said 62-year-old voters to Goose Tanevski, the capital of Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, in the Macedonian city of Strumika -- Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaves, his wife Zorica, and his son Duscon -- have publicly added their ballots to change Macedonia's name, thereby diverting the state's path to NATO and Europe.
In Skopje, in front of the council, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardov, he was making a small stage and smashing the chairs in front of the tents that had been placed there by the anti-communicated individuals.
- We're on the side of NATO and Europe, but we want to join them proudly, not from the door of service.
-We're a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go to China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration," Kourard said.
Professor Zaves says NATO membership is going to make a big investment in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I think the overwhelming majority will be on the side, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are on the side of NATO and Europe," said Zave after filling in his ballot.
He said, "Yes," the answer would be "the attractiveness of their good future."
According to a poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, 30 to 43 percent of voters voted aside, less than the required votes.
According to another Telma TV question, 57 percent of Macedonia is still preparing to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they were going to vote.
In order to be successful, participation must be 50 percent and one voice.
The failure of the collective will be the first serious blow to the civility of Western government, starting last May.
Wait, Manchester City Sergio Aguero defeated Briton's entire defense to hit the door.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling were released from British Defence at Manchester City 2-0, which took place on Sunday in England at Manchester Ethihad.
Aguero made it so that the 65th minute of the game seemed easy to get his shot.
The Argentine attacker was transferred to the center of the field at the beginning of the game.
He slid through Britney's three defenders until he went through the open field.
After Aguero, he was surrounded by four green robes.
He circled around one of them, and he walked through a few more of them at Briton's gate.
And then he did the transmission to Sterling, who was left of him.
The English attacker, as he reached the gate, pushed the ball back to Aguero, who struck the ball with his right foot, and gave it direction to the British gatekeeper Matthew Ryan, and the ball leaped to the right corner of the gate.
"Aguero has some leg problems," said City Manager Pep Guardiola's reporters.
We talked about him playing 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
Our luck was that he was able to score at that moment.
But Skye Blusin gave Sterling an initial advantage in Premier League.
That shot was recorded in the 29th minute of the game.
Aguero got the ball in the middle of Brittany.
He did it on his left hand to Leroy Sane.
Shane made a few shots, then handed over the ball to Sterling, who was on the other side of the field.
The Sky Bluss threw the ball into the door until the borders were cut.
Siti will go out against Hofenheim on Wednesday at 12:55 p.m., Rayne-Negar Arena, in the German city of Sinsheim.
Sherzer wants to win an unexpected victory against Rocky.
Since the Nationals were out of the game competition, it was pointless to start again.
But with a competitive spirit, she hopes to go out against Colorado Rocky Sunday, but only if it's possible to play with Rocky who will play against Los Angeles Dodger in the Netherlands West.
The Rockies have pretty much provided a place for them to win on Friday 5-2 against the Nationals, but they still hope to keep the first title in their division.
Although we play for nothing, we can throw the ball, confident that the atmosphere and crowd of Denver will not be the opposite of me at the highest level I'd ever meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in this?
Nationals still have to announce early Sunday, but as they say, they tend to let Cerceres present themselves in such a situation.
The Scherser, who had to do his 34th blow, threw the ball on Thursday and will be back on his usual rest Sunday.
Washington's right hand is 18-7 at 2.53 ERA and 300 at 220/2/3 transfer time.
The tram is a public meeting in West Virginia.
The president was directly involved in a speech on the importance of the election of Brett Kavana in the state of the state of the state.
All we've done is in November.
The most important choices in our lives have been five weeks.
"That's one of the biggest, biggest choices. I'm not in charge, but I'm actually in charge, and that's why I'm fighting so hard for good applicants," she said.
The drum continued: "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats, you see how it's happening right now.
And they're ready to return the power at any cost, you see the trick and the bow.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go through to get power and government, that's what they need, and we're not going to give it to them.
"Democratics," he says, "have a task to face and resist."
And you see it during these four days, he said, "He called the democrats angry, rude, immoral and deceptive people."
He made a reference to the Senate Judicial Committee's Democrat St. Diane Feynstein, which is a high-level audience.
"Do you remember his answer?"
Did you make the document?
Uh, uh, what:
No, no, I'm waiting for someone -- that was a very bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Leborist party is no longer a large church.
It's very intolerant to those who express their thoughts.
When Momentum's activists took me out to share, it wasn't surprising.
Finally, I'm the last person in the list of messengers from the Leborist party to say that it's not good to see us here... and because we're expressing our thoughts.
My advisor's colleague Joan Ryan showed a similar attitude because she was determinedly opposed to anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, I've been criticized by the bandits because I've opposed Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, and the issue of the status quo, which was not in agreement with the former leaders.
We want the meetings to be meaningful and effective.
As a messenger of my local work party for most of the eight years, the GC congregations were just like that on Friday.
Regrettably, today the festival of many congregations isn't so, and "better and more honest" politics has been forgotten before, if, of course, it's ever been.
El has become more evident that the Leborist party does not tolerate different views, and everyone's opinion is viewed as acceptable or unacceptable by the leaders of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when my colleagues, who I thought shared a common political view, began to expect me to change my views and have views that I would never otherwise agree with -- whether it was about national security or the EU's single market.
I'm speaking in front of the public (and it doesn't matter what I'm saying), in social networks, it follows the wave of insults by calling, and denouncing elections, condemning central politics and telling me that I have no right to be a Leborist party.
And it's not just my experience.
Of course, I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues, because the comments I made at my address are of a political nature.
I am amazed at the skill and determination of my colleagues who tolerate sexual or racist abuse every day, but never avoid it.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is how the levels of injury have become normal.
Jeremy Corbin announced last week that the Leborist party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're no longer that enlarged church, and participation in any movement of "uncertainty" or changes in the rules of choice is getting more and more fishy.
Over the past two years, I've been advised to throw down my head a lot, don't talk so much, and then I'll be all right.
But I didn't go into the political field to do that.
Since I joined the Leborists 32 years ago as a school student from being ignored by the government of Tatcher, so that my co-school was literally down, I began to try to provide better public services to those who needed it most, whether as a local adviser or as a minister of government.
I've never given up my politics; the last choices are no exception.
No one in the Eastern Nottinhem confuses my political views and the disagreements with today's leaders.
All I'm going to say to those who move on Friday is that when the country moves to Brexit, which will harm the household, business and our public services, I don't understand about the leader of the LeBourist Party's commitment to the time and the desire to waste energy.
But actually, my only statement is not about the Momentum of Nottinhem, but about my supporters, or the Leborist party, or not, and I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that the threat of any choice or political expectation will not hold me back from doing what I find is what comes out of all of your profits.

Eyre 38-17 Melrose... the proud Eyre rises.
The last two experiments could have changed the outcome somehow, but Eyren certainly deserved to win this wonderful and fun day of the Tennant Premiership.
They're now at the top of the table, on the one side of ten.
Finally, it was their great protection, as well as their success, that won the host side, and coach Peter Mürich had the full right to be satisfied.
"We've been tried during these games, but we haven't won yet, so I have to be happy," he said.
From Melrose, Robin Christie said, "Aprie Erry, they took better advantage of their opportunities than we did."
Great Anderson's 14th-minute hit, transmitted by Frasier Hughes, pushed Eyre ahead, but in Scotland's yard, Rory Hughes's yellow card, which he had won with the Warriers for the game, gave Melrose an opportunity to add to the account, and Jane Begott made an unprecedented hit.
Klimon so far extended Eyre's initial position with a tignane -- after half the time went straight, he was a profit-free one, and then he tried to do a single strike to make the count 17-5 Eyre in the interval.
But Melrose got a good start on the second game, and Patrick Anderson's hit, which he passed on to Begot, reduced the difference of account by five units.
Then he stopped for a long time, which was the cause of the serious damage to Ruard Nott, and he was removed, and after restart, Eyre went further through the attack by Jeffrey McDowell through Klimo.
The captain of the Air Force, Blair McPherson, received a yellow card at the time, and Melrose again suffered an additional blow at the end of a severe pressure.
The host side, however, came back, and when Street Hatkinson got the yellow card because he didn't take Klimo out of the ball, MacPerson fell on the ball that was moving ahead of Eyre.
Clymbo hit as he almost started again, then Kyle Rowe prevented David Armstrong from hitting and sent a flange to Gregor Henry away to cut the other half of the host side.
The Still Game star is ready to start a new career in the restaurant area.
The silent game star, Ford Kierera, is ready to move into the hospitality area after it became clear that he has become the director of a registered restaurant company.
He plays the role of Jack Jarvis in a famous BBC show, which he writes and which he's photographing with his former associate, Greg Hemphill.
The couple have announced that the 9th generation that is ahead of us will be the last transmission, and it turns out Kierna is planning to plan her life after Craiging.
According to official lists, he's Edwardmore Limitid's manager.
The drama refused to comment on the story, despite the Scottish Sun source saying Kiernana wants to join Glasgow's "sweet restaurant trade."
"The sea is ours," Bolivia, surrounded by land, hopes that the court will re-evaluate the way to the Pacific.
Ships keep La Paz's military base.
Public buildings have cut out the ocean blue mark.
From the Titicaca lake to the Amazonian war stations, the sea is our law.
It's our duty to restore it.
The memory of Chile's water line lost in the 19th century in a bloody conflict with Chile's resources is still hot in Bolivia.
These hopes, perhaps, are at the highest level over the decades, because Bolivia is waiting for the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of consultations.
Bolivia has a purpose, it has a spirit of unity and peace, and, of course, expects a good ending," said the Bolivian diagnoser Roberto Calzadilla.
Most Bolivians will see the decision of the AMD, which will be displayed on all large screens of the earth, hoping that the Haaga tribunal will be on the side of Bolivia's claim that Chile is obliged to negotiate with Bolivia and give it a release to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's local crisis president, who is now making a decisive fight for next year, has also played a decisive role in the decision made on the two-week day.
"We're very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts think the court's decision would not be for Bolivia's sake, and it would have changed little if it had.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no control over Chile's areas, and said it won't determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
Since the U.M.D.'s verdict comes six months after hearing about the final contradictions, it shows that the work was not "barred," said Chile's expert Paz Zaratt on the international law line.
And since Bolivia's next progress, four years could slow it down.
--BOLlVlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
Moralez's military speech has become the reason Chile's last signs of kindness have been removed.
Finally, Bolivia and Chile will continue to communicate one day, but then the discussions will be very difficult.
The two countries have not been replaced by ambassadors since 1962.
In the future, Bolivian representative and former president of the country, Eduardo Rodríguez Wellsen, rejected the idea that the court decided at an extraordinary rate.
On Tuesday, Bolivia will be given the "extraordinary opportunity to start a new cycle of relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "end the 139 years of debate on the profits of the bilateral," he said.
Kalzadilla also denied that Morales was still one of the most famous presidents in Latin America, using the sea problem as a political ideal.
Bolivia will never give up on the Pacific free way out of its possession -- it added.
The solution allows us to see that we have to overcome the past.
North Korea says there won't be a nuclear war unless the US inspires confidence.
Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea says that his people will never cut off the nuclear weapon until he can trust Washington.
Rin was giving a speech in the United Nations headquarters on Sunday.
He called on the United States to follow the promises he had made at the summit of the opposition leaders in Singapore.
His comments come as the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Popoen, as if he were with Kim Cheen Yune in North Korea on the basis of the resumption of the nuclear duality in prison, more than three months after the Singapore Summit.
Ri says it's a "dreamous dream" that continues to apply punishments, and the subject of the announcement of the end of the Korean war in North Korea will never go down the knee.
Washington is careful to agree to the ad without a major step towards the Pionang Army.
And Kim and the U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there's a widespread mistrust that the Pioneer is serious about refusing military supplies, which the country probably considers the only way to ensure security.
Pompéon is going to visit the Pioneer next month to prepare for the next Kim-Tramp summit.
A new collection of headlines was presented in the Paris fashion exhibition, which will soon be on the High Street.
If you want to expand your collection of heads and completely protect yourself from sunlight, that's what you need.
Scholars Valentino and Tom Brown presented the SS19 major pieces of their new collection during the Paris fashion week, and it surprised everyone.
Many inefficient headlines have become an entrant this summer, and these designs have sent their eyebrows to the podium.
Valentine's collection was the largest body head, decorated with a wide range of feathers that was wrapped on the model's head.
But there are too many exhilarators, and they're not meant to keep your head warm.
Tom Brone also showed the choice of extra faces -- that is, Halloween.
Many of the colorful faces had lips that remind Hannibal Lester of more than a high-tech suit.
One creation recalled an underground suction device, along with its tube and eyepieces, while the other was like a poultice cone.
And if you continue to make a statement of superiority, you'll be successful.
Supervised viewers predict that huge waves may soon appear on your main streets.
The larger than usual was followed by "La Bombaa," which is the two-legged cordhead that has been seen by all, from Rihanna to Emile Ratajkeveski.
A very uncomfortable header worship label, spread across all social media, sent another great creation to the pod, a striped swimwear bag, which was almost as big as a swimwear model
The dark brown raffia bag, with a premeditated and covered white leather coat, is the worst in the week of the collection of the SS19 in La Rivera in Paris.
The Starmaker Luke Emitage told FEMAIL: "I hope to see large heads and swimbags in the main streets next summer, because the designers have left such an impact that it's hard to ignore the demand for too many exhilarators.
John Edward: Language skills are very important to global citizens.
Scotland's independent schools keep records of academic excellence, which continued in 2018, with another amazing series of study results, which has only been reinforced by individual and group success in sport, art, music and other community activities.
In Scotland, with more than 30,000 students, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strive to offer their students and parents the highest level of service.
Independent schools are trying to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their place as a global citizen.
As an area of education that can design and implement a pre-conditional curriculum, we see that today's languages continue to be advanced and desirable in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language that he understands, it'll get to his head.
If you speak to a person in his language, it'll get into his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we can't just go to English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's reviews, we can see that languages are at the top of the league table, with the highest percentage of students in independent schools.
68 percent of foreign-language students received a high grade A.
Data collected from 74 schools in SCIS shows that 72 percent of students received high grade A Mandarin, while 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are in addition to foreign languages as necessary skills that will undoubtedly be required in the future by children and young people.
Now, in schools, languages as a subject of choice are treated in the same way as STEM objects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).
In 2014, Britain's employment and skills commission discovered the causes that make it difficult for employees to fill the gaps, 17 percent of them attributed to a lack of language skills.
Thus, more and more language skills become the main thing to prepare young people for their future careers.
With the possibility of more advanced language skills, these skills have become important in the global world.
No matter what career they choose, if they learn the second language, they'll have a real advantage in the future, mastering the skills that this is until the end of life.
Having the ability to communicate directly with foreigners in a few languages will automatically lead to competition.
According to the 2013 survey by YouGov, 75% of the adult British were unable to speak in a foreign language to the extent that they could speak, and the French was the only language spoken in a heavenly percentage, 15%.
That's why it's important for children today to invest in teaching languages.
Controlling a few languages, especially in developing countries, will allow children to find meaningful work.
Every school in Scotland will be divided into its taught languages.
A number of schools will focus on more advanced classical languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for Great Britain in 2020. These are Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest in, no matter how many languages he or she can choose, there will always be a number of languages in schools, and the staff of these schools will be experts in this field.
The aim of Scottish independent schools is to provide a teaching environment that will prepare children and know them with the skills they need to succeed, regardless of what lies ahead.
Now, in this global business environment, we can't deny that languages continue to be essential for the future of the country, so this should be shown in education.
In fact, they really need to be called "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
It has to be done.
John Edward is president of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
LeBron has to make Lakers' debut on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait for the worshipers to see LeBron James ’ debut in Los Angeles Lakes is nearing its end.
Lakers' coach Luke Wellton announced that James would play the opening of the Sunday session against Denver Naggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he'll play, he still has to decide.
"That'll be more than one minute, but less than 48," Wellton said on Lakers' official website.
Mike Trudell, from Lakers' paper, made a statement that James would probably play a limited time.
Following this week's show earlier, James was asked about Lakers' plans for a six-game pre-season plot.
"In this phase of my career, I don't need pre-season games to get better," he said.
Thramp: The Time of the Assembly in West Virginia, Yutubi River
President Donald Trump is launching a wave of preferential advertising in West Virginia this evening.
This is the first of five collections planned for the next week of the Trump, including standing in friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
In order to fill the gap in the Supreme Court's election, the split has slowed down, while the Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming elections, because citizens are at the end of losing control over Congress, while the voices will be counted in November.
What time is it going to be for the Tromp rally in West Virginia today, and how can you view it online?
The Tromp meeting in Wiling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 pm. ET today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can view the Tromp -- the public collection in West Virginia -- online, with the Yutubian line below.
The trial will probably talk about Brett Kavana's hearings this week by the Supreme Court, which has become a subject of tension due to sexual misconduct, bringing with him the delay in the Senate's establishment to investigate one week's HDB.
But the main purpose of these mass media is to help citizens who are standing in front of the November elections to get a motor force.
So President Trompe’s campaign said that the next week, five meetings would be held “to strengthen volunteers and supporters, while citizens try to protect and expand the majority of the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives, ” says Reuters.
"Conference control is so important to his system that the president will move as many states as possible as we enter the busy promotional season," said Trompe, who refused to mention his name, according to Reuters.
Today's public meeting in Wesbanko Arena, in Washington, D.C., can bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania to get enlightenment from the Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
In the last month, there will be the second day of the week that Tromp visits West Virginia, where in 2016 he won more than 40 percent of the units.
The tram is trying to help the West Virginia Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisie, who's registered in the poll.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisi that the president has come to try to encourage him in the elections," said Simon Heder, who, according to Reuters, is a political scientist at West Virginia University.
The Ryder Cup 2018 US team was confident that hopes would stay alive until Sunday play.
After three solo sessions, after Sunday afternoon, the square could just be what Ryder needed.
It's a full-blown sports idea that players really believe, and never more than they do in such competitions.
So according to them, where is the motor power now?
"They had a 6-unit advantage, which is now 4, and I think we're keeping it as a small motor force," said Jordan Speed on that day.
Europe has a 4-unit advantage, and 12 more have to play.
The Americans, as Speed says, feel that there's little wind in their charms, even though they have a lot to inspire, no less than the shape of Swift and Justin Thomas, who have played with each other all day, and each of them has added 3 units.
Spythe was dead at tea to green, and he's leading by example.
The concert halls were even stronger, while his round was continuing, and he took a decisive strike to get the right to play in four fields, when he and Thomas got together after two.
His hit that won them 15 times was combined with a similar noise, which tells you that the American team isn't out of it.
"You have to work more and worry only about your game," said Spit.
This is what each of these players has left now.
18 holes, to do the sign.
The only players who have more unity than Spitt and Thomas have been Francesco Molinari and Tom Flywood for the last 2 days are the unmistakable story of Ryder Square.
It's strange in Europe, but the attractive couple is 4 out of 4 and it can't be wrong.
"Molywood" was the only couple who didn't get a bite on the Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided it on the Saturday morning, on the Friday afternoon, and on the Friday morning golf.
That race, and how their energy seemed to flow to and from that fierce crowd, confirms that they are players who are due to win on Friday, and no longer be more famous than Flitfoud or Molinari than the women's potential European victory, while the sun enters the Le Golf Nation.
It's preferable for both to be at the same time, in different holes.
But talks about European glory are still early.
Bobba Watson and Webb Simpson wrote a short piece about Sergio Garcia, a morning golf hero when he was Alex Nore's colleague.
One and two doubles on the first nine pushed the Spanish and the Swedish to the door, and they never managed to get out.
But on the Sunday, no one will help you out of your pit.
Looking closely at the four balls and squares is so interesting: the relationship between the two of you, the advice they give, the advice they don't see, and how the challenge can change in a moment.
Europe as a team has been better played during this time and has made remarkable progress until the closing day, but the quadruple session has shown that the U.S. Team has shown an enthusiasm that no one, especially Sitsside, expected.
On the final day of the Ryder Warehouse, Europe had a 10-6-year-old advance.
On the Day of the end of the Ryder Cup, Europe will have a great advantage over the 10-6-year-long progress of the U.S.
The inspired Tommy Flywood and Francisco Molinari have changed the game's score by two victories, against the opposing Tiger Wooder, to get their score up to even La Golf National 4 units.
The European side of Thomas Byron, who was trying to return to Heselton two years ago, lost his yard, came to the government on the American side in the morning game of 3-1.
The U.S. showed greater resistance during the game, but they failed to win.
On the side of Jim Fuhrer, we need 12 single games on Sunday on a single day to get the yard back.
Flywood is the first European player who has been able to earn four units in succession, while he and Molinar, who have received the name Molywood after a six-day break, are only the second of the two couples who won four in their initial four games in the history of Ryder's yard.
After breaking four balls, Woods and Patrick Reedy worked hard to beat Woods and Braise Dechambeou, a bigger 5-4.
The Woods, who gave him a hard time between the two games on the Sabbath, showed a great game, but he's already lost 29 of his 19 games, 7 of which are behind each other.
Justin Rose, resting from a game in the morning, returned to his roommate Henry Stanson in a four-time game, and scored a 2-1 win on Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coepka, who are the first and third of the world.
Europe, however, didn't have that pleasant, windy day in southwestern Paris.
Irrigation champions Jordan Speyet and Justin Thomas gave a lecture to the Americans on two days a week.
They beat Spanish John Rami and Jan Polter with four balls and then returned to win Pokter and Rory McKilro with four-thirds of the four-points.
There was only 2 times in Ryder's story that the team would come back with the lack of 4 units and go through the game alone, even though there's only nobody on the side of Furick to keep the yard.
Two days after being the second best ever, however, after the opposite of Sunday, it seems like the thing is above them.
North Korea says "no way" won't be completely armed without confidence.
The Foreign Minister of North Korea said in the United Nations on a Saturday that ongoing punishments strengthen confidence in the United States, and the country will never give up its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
R. Yong Hoon told the world's world's most recent summit that North Korea had undertaken "significant charitable measures" last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and counter-narrative testing, the deployment of a mid-test facility and the responsibility not to transfer nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we don't see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
Without trust in the United States, we can't have the security guarantee of our nation, and in such circumstances we won't be the first to break up.
Before Reyn repeated the known dissatisfaction of North Korea -- the "pull" approach to the cyclone of Washington -- during which North Korea will be honored until it takes steps, his announcement was important, because it did not reject the bridging of the isolation took control, as it had done in the past.
On June 12th, Reyn responded to a joint announcement by North Korea's leader Kim Young Woni and US President Donald Trump at the first meeting of the summit, where Kim promised to work on the settlement of the Korean peninsula, while Tromp promised to ensure North Korea's safety.
North Korea has always wanted to end the Korean war in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Phenan should be the first to surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington also rejected the calls to mitigate the strong international sanctions applied to South Korea.
-The U.S. claims that "mediation will be a priority" and adds pressure through penalties to achieve its goal necessarily, and even "an announcement of the end of the war," said Rehn.
The understanding that punishment can bring us down is just the dream of those who don't know us.
But the problem is that constant punishments also deepen our confidence.
Reyn didn't say anything about Kim and Tromp's second summit program, which the U.S. leader had pointed out earlier this week in the United States.
Instead, the president highlighted the 3rd meeting between Kim and Chief of South Korea, Mu Jayin, over the past five months, and added, "If this problem of stabbing was on the side of South Korea, but not the United States, the stabbing of the Korean peninsula would not reach this lock.
Even so, Ri's speech was markedly different from last year's speech, when he said at the U.S. General Assembly that the U.S. mainland was inevitable when he called "the man of the raids."
In the United Nations this year, Trump, who had threatened to "destroy lions" in North Korea last year, praised Kim for his courageous steps, but said there was still much work to be done, and the punishments had to continue until North Korea was eliminated.
Wednesday, which Tramp said it didn't have its deadline, saying "it doesn't matter if it lasts two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia claim that the United Nations Security Council should compensate for the steps taken by Phenai.
However, U.S. Secretary-General Mike Pompey of the United Nations Security Council said on Thursday, "The implementation of sanctions by the Security Council should continue actively and without failures to the full, final, established rejection of nuclear weapons.
Since 2006, the Security Council has been applying sanctions to North Korea in order to be able to disrupt Phenian's nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.
Pompéo met in the framework of the United Nations High Assembly in Raha and said he'd come back next month to prepare for the second summit in Phenya.
Pompéon has already gone to Phenia three times this year, but the last visit didn't go so well.
She left Phenai in July, saying that she had made progress, and that North Korea was able to blame herself for "gangstering requirements" in a few hours.
At this month's meeting, North Korea promised to connect the turbulence station and the nuclear complex if the United States took "appropriate measures."
He told Kim that the "appropriate means" in Singapore are the guarantees of the promised security of Thramp and are aimed at improving relations with Washington.
Harvard University students are taking a special course on how to get enough rest.
The new course allowed his final students to sleep more to fight the growing macho culture, it was with the help of caffeine to learn all night.
Academics have found that students at one university in the world often have no basic knowledge of how to care for themselves.
This course was made up of Professor of Sleeping Doctors at Harvard Medical School and Professor Charles Kiesler of Brigham and Kanes Hospital, according to which this was the first in the United States.
He was encouraged to start his course on how illiteracy affects education.
Finally, a girl came up to her and said, "Why am I the only one who knows about this in high school now?"
"He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which is very surprising," said telegraph.
This year's first class explains to students how good sleep habits can affect education and exercise as well as general self-esteem.
Director of Health Services at Harvard Medical School, Paul Barry, said that the university had decided on a course that would make sure that the students didn't really sleep that week.
One hour's training includes various interactive tasks.
It's a part of it, where students, by pressing on coffee cups, toilets, trainers and books, learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and how incomplete sleep can affect the state of the art, as well as the importance of the sleep regime.
Another part tells participants how to increase the risk of long-acting heart beat, stroke, depression, and cancer.
An interactive map encourages participants to think about everyday life.
"We know that this can't change the behavior of students right away."
"But we believe they have the right to know about it, as you have the right to know about the effects of smoking on your health," added Professor Kaiser.
According to his "getting all night" proud culture still exists, he added that modern technologies and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean that inadequacy is a growing problem.
Sleeping enough must be the secret weapon of students to cope with stress, fatigue and anxiety, even weight gain, because lack unites the diet of the brain and they are always hungry.
Raymond, a 19-year-old Californian student in chemistry and physics, is helping Professor Kassler to organize a course last year in Harvard during his first course.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired the whole university to perform.
Next, he expects the audience to be asked to participate in this educational program before taking part in the establishment competition.
Professor Castle advises students to chart with a reminder when to go to sleep when to wake up. As well as learning about the harmful effects of the blue light released by electronic screens and LED lighting, which is also an obstacle to sleeping.
LIVINGSTON 10.0 Rangers Mengan defeated the Jordanians.
The Rangers were hit once again, because the Dolly Mengani team beat Stephen Gerard's team at a score of 1.0 in Livington.
In Johnston, after the 4th of February, Imbrox wanted to record his first victory, but Gary Holts' team disappointed Gerard for the second time, leaving the 8-unit difference in the Ledbroke Prize.
Menga came out of the game 7 minutes ago, and it seemed that the Rangers' team would never be ready to play.
But the Rangers are the sixth horizontal, and LIVINGSTON is going to go with the third few horizontal goals in striking the hybrid.
Later, there was another problem for the chains, because the liner in Kalin Spence was damaged by what he threw himself.
Gerard's eight-unit difference also led to the semi-final replacement of Eyrin in Betfred.
And on the other hand, last week, Holt joined a team that took Livington, and he was wondering how the opponents got their hands on his good preparation.
The Rangers may have been in a dominant position, but LIVINGSTON was using the gecko more.
They used two minutes when Megan left the game for the first time, which also allowed Scott Pittman to grab the door of Allan McGregor, but the paramedics cut the ball.
The battle of Kaagan Jacobs reached Craig Halktet, but half-defense Alan Litgou was only able to squeeze the ball back.
The Rangers took the game, but in the last half, there was more hope in the game than in faith.
Alfredo Morelez must have suffered a painful blow because he was in conflict with Stephen Lollez, but the contestant Stephen Thompson did not pay attention to the Colombians' calls.
The Rangers were in the first round to execute two strikes, but the former porter Liam Kelley of Inbrooks was concerned about the attacks of Lasana Colibei and Ovi Ijariya.
In the 34th minute of Livingstone, the opening of the game was against the rules of the game, but no one could deny that it was worth a shot.
The Rangers were unable to resist Jacobs' strike again.
Scott Arfield did not respond to the fact that Declan Calger gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who handed it over to Megan to finish.
Gerard replaced Calibal with Ren Kent, and then the attacker hit Morelez, and Shaky Keeley just hit the ball.
Livington kept cheering the audience in his play, because Litgou and Halkitt kept holding the ball to them.
Holt's team were able to run the game for their own good, but McGreeger was able to push Jacobs back before he fell from the Litgoon corner.
Glen Middleton, who replaced the Rangers, had to be given the right to go back to the train, because they were in contact with Jacobs, but he ignored it again.
Calculator by Almanac Giger
And now a part of our Sunday morning from Almanac -- September 30, 1882 -- 136 years ago this day -- this day was born in Germany by physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Gigger.
Gigger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which made Gigger's calculator.
At one time, Giger's main science calculator also became one of the main cornerstones of the pop culture, such as the "Coronado Rings" movie, whose main heroes are little likely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: What's that?
Roger: This is Giger's calculator that helps detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
By listening to these listeners, you hear the presence of radioactive atoms.
Evans, tell me, it's really working now.
Hans Gigger died in 1945 a few days before he was 63.
But the git that bears his name lives to this day.
The new cancer hormone can teach the immune system to see foreign cells.
The new cancer can teach the immune system to see and kill foreign cells.
As an integral part of treatment, the hormone teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells.
The purpose of the method is to take the immune cells from the patient and change them into laboratory doses.
They'll find many types of cancer and then give it back to the patient.
The test of the vaccine shows promising results among cancer patients.
A woman who had been admitted to a felony known to have fake cells found that her ovary cancer had disappeared more than 18 months later.
The purpose of the method is to take the immune cells from the patient and change them into laboratory conditions to detect many types of cancer called HER2 and then reintroduce those cells to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzoski of the National Institute of Cancer in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results show that the cure is promising."
HER2 generates several types of cancer, including cervical, ovary, lung, and spleen, explains Professor Berzowski.
The patient's approach to taking immune cells and teaching cancer cells has also helped to treat a type of leukaemia.
Kenya's West, with the title "Reactivate America", started the debate on Saturday Night Live (SNL).
It didn't work well.
The Kenyan West was shocked at the SNL study when he began praising the United States -- President Donald Trump -- and he announced that he would be appointed in 2020.
He sang the third song of that night, called "The City of the U.S.," with the title "Reactivate America," and then he began criticizing the Democrats and executing the Trump.
When I talk to the whites, they say, "How can you love Trump? He's racist."
"Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd been from America a long time," he said.
SNL began with his show, like Matt Dennon, where the Hollywood star was playing in front of the Senate Judicial Committee of Christina Blaise's testimony to the sexual violence of Brett Cavano.
Although it wasn't shown, the video of West was posted on social networks by humorist Chris Rock.
It's not clear whether Rock did it to get Westie or not.
Weste also complained to the overseer, who was making it difficult for her to keep her head in check.
They complained about me.
They said don't go out with that cap.
They made my head.
According to Washington Examiner, I'm in paradise.
He continued, "You want to see the paradise," saying, as if he wanted to dress up his superman's back, as if it would mean no one could say if he did what he did.
"Try to love."
His comments angered the audience twice. SNL members were also concerned about the night. Variety writes that even a man said, "The whole study is buried."
Weste presented the singer Ariana Grande, whose former partner died a few days ago.
Veste confused many by singing "I Love" as Perrier Bottle.
Westy was in favor of a conservation team leader, Kandas Tore, who wrote, "For one of the singles. Thank you for the support of the crowd."
Reporter Karen Hunter wrote that West was just what there was, and that's absolutely wonderful.
"But I don't want to praise anyone by buying his songs, his clothes, or his art when his opinion is dangerous to my community."
"He's free."
"We are, too," he added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and is now officially known as the Key West.
He's not the first artist to change his name. He's following Didy, who's also known as Puff Didy, Puff and P Didy.
Snob Doug was also renamed Snob Lane, and the legend of music really changed his name as a symbol, and so did the Prince.
There's been an experiment of drug abuse in the Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man was arrested on Friday at one of the East Belfast restaurants with a suspicion of stabbing a man.
The police said the incident was happening in Balochamamore.
On Monday, the defendant will appear before the Belfast District Court.
The charge will be dropped by the prosecution.
The star of the film of the Royal Games is a poisoned male body. 2
Kitt Haringon is well known for his sharp role in HBO's HBO's play on violent fantasy television.
But 31-year-old actress broke the Macho-Hero's rigidity, saying that these roles make the boys think that they should be treated with a gross respect.
Speaking to Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he didn't think it was something, and asked how to solve the problem of poisoned manhood in the #MeToo century.
Kitt, who recently married Rosie Leslie, a 31-year-old star in the Gahar game again, said she was very determined to solve the problem.
"I think a lot of myself where we've been wrong about manhood," he said.
"As we taught men, they grew up, and now we see the problem."
Kit believes that television should be partly responsible for teaching poisoned men with its many male characters.
He continued, "What is natural and what is acquired."
What they learn from television and the streets, which makes young people become men of that kind.
I think this is one of the first problems of our time. How do we change it?
"Because it's definitely bad for young boys."
During the interview, he admitted that when the game of the Princes ends next summer, he won't play any more in the race, because he's tired of the fields and horses.
From November, the whale has to play the essence of the West of Sam Sheppard, which is a story about the film director and his brother who stole.
The playmaker recently confirmed that his wife, Leslie, was the first good thing in the game of the Gahri.
"I met my wife in this film, and that was my future family, and then the beginning of my life," he said.
Rosie, a TV star of Emmy's fantasy, has framed Igrid, a girl who loves John Snow, who's in love with Kit.
The couple married in Scotland in June 2018 at Leslie's home.
HIV/AIDS China reports an increase of 14 percent.
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people suffering from HIV/AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been infected in the earth, and the bodies of health are being collected.
Only 40,000 cases were recorded in the second quarter of 2018.
In contrast, most of the events in the past have been transmitted by sexual means.
In some parts of China, HlV spread rapidly through infected blood.
At the conference in the district of Yuni, reports from the Chinese health authorities have even been disfellowshipped from the IIA.
But the number of people suffering from HIV/AIDS is increasing by 100000.
The sexual transmission of HIV has become the leading factor in China's LGBT community.
1997 China rejected homosexuality, but discrimination against the LGBT community is considered unfair.
Because of the Earth's conservation values, it's said that 70,90 percent of men who have sex with men are going to get married.
The main cause of transmission of diseases is unprotected sexual relations.
Since 2003, the government of China has promised to provide access to HIV treatment to solve the problem.
Maxim Walter denies that data from the senators of the Great Old Party has been leaked, claims to be dangerous lies and allegations.
Maxim Walter of the United States sentenced those charges on Saturday because one of the members of his team posted personal data from three public senators in the Wikipedia.
The lawmakers of Los Angeles have confirmed that the protests have been made by experts from extreme supporters and web sites.
"A lie, a lie, and a malicious lie," said the journalist in his statement.
The reported information included home addresses and cell phone numbers belonging to United States Senates from South Carolina to Lindsey Gram and Utah Miki Lin and Ori Hatchi.
Information was posted by an anonymous person on the Internet on Thursday in Capitol Hill at the hearings of the Supreme Court on Brett Cavano's sexual abuse.
This was after the three senates examined Cavano.
The maintenance sites Gateway Puntit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source of the messages is consistent with the address of the Waters Office, and that was the source of information about the Waters Service.
Votters continued that these baseless charges are completely wrong and absolutely false.
My staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been discovered as a result of these false and false accusations, have no responsibility for the outcome of the information.
These baseless accusations are completely wrong and absolutely false.
Votters' announcement was immediately criticised throughout the Internet -- former Mamlo secretary Ari Flasher from the White House.
"This is disgusting," the flasher wrote.
This means he doesn't want to be a member of the convention.
When someone is accused of something wrong, he shouldn't be angry.
He shouldn't be opposed.
He shouldn't question the defendant's motives.
He needs to stay calm and calm.
Flasher compared the reaction of Votters to the criticisms of the D.C. Cavano, which critics accused of being angry about the time of Wednesday's hearings.
In the interim elections, public candidate Omar Navaro tried to overthrow Votters and shared his opinion on Twitter.
"Good, if you're right," he wrote in a funny way.
In his statement, Votters said that his office had warned appropriate law enforcement bodies and law enforcement bodies about these charges.
He continued, "We will follow that the culprits will be discovered," he continued, "they will be fully held responsible for their actions, which have a dangerous and destructive effect on any member of my staff.
About Johnny English Strikes Again.
Now it's a tradition to look for Brexit in a new British-language film that you wanted. It's like it's acceptable to Johnny English in the event of a rebirth of music, which began early in 2003 and was renamed Johnny English in 2011.
It's funny to think about how obvious we're to have a national export opportunity.
In any case, in an incomprehensible way, with little eyes, with an unpleasant face, Johnny English was given a second degree, which means he's a funny face for non-English societies.
Of course, it's a stupid secret officer who, despite a little bit of his weirdness, looked like Clouseau, Mr. Bin, having his investment in the 2012 London Olympics opening.
He's also originally based on the character of a secret traveler and an international man, Attixon, who played in the already forgotten Barclaycard TV advertisement, creating a chaos behind him.
There's one or two beautiful moments in Johnny English.
I loved Johnny English as I approached the paper with medieval military clothes and hats, around which the paper was wrapped around.
Attixon's physical musical gift is shown, but the humor has lost its power and is considered more important, because it's already an integral part of serious movies like 007 and a real mission.
Humor is more attractive to children than adults. And to me, Johnny English Atixon's character is not beautiful and fixed.
In fact, Britain is currently in serious danger.
The cyber barriers have entered the Internet data of British pirates, revealing the identity of secret agents, replacing the official, which is a little bit of a role for Kevin Edon.
This is the last drop for a confused and persecuted governor who suffers from a feeling of political uncertainty. Emma Thompson is doing impossible in Teresa Mai's role, but there's nothing on the stage to do.
Counsellors say that since all the ladders are open, they have to bring one of the last of the rest.
This means returning to Johnny English, who is now teaching in a number of institutions, but at the same time teaching how to be a busy officer.
England has returned to Whitehall for a quick conversation and has joined his former partner, Buffie, who plays Ben Miller.
Buff is now married and is a commander of the Souzanav, a happy hockey team where Vic Peperdin is a bit weak.
So Batman and Robin make big mistakes and return to secret service, and meet the beautiful woman of Olga Kurlenco, Ophelia Bulatova.
But the chief has fallen into the trap of billiards techs who believe they can solve Britain's computer problems, Jack Lacey, who has played the role of abuser Jason Volta.
English and Buff are starting a series of their jokes. As a facilitator, they burn the French restaurant, and they're messing up on Volta's ship.
Finally, all the actions have been made clear, but because they were fun and interesting, there's a whole children's television about them.
It's quite moderate.
And taking into account other English films, I always wonder if it's possible that British filmmaking would give Roman Atixon a role that would really be fair to his talent.
Leborists claim they're planning a plan that says the British will work for 4 days, but will be rewarded for 5 days.
Jeremy Corbin's Leborist party is planning a plan that the British will work for 4 days, but will be rewarded for 5 days.
Society wants companies to give their employees an extra day off because of the presence of artificial intelligence.
It would be good for the workers to have a three-day rest, but they'll get a reward for the rest of the day.
Sources say that this idea has entered the economic system, and it's planned to change the country for the benefit of the workers.
The idea of a 4-day working week was established by the World Trade Congress, which is a good way for workers to benefit from economic change.
The Labour Party spokesperson told Sunday Times: "The proposal will be reviewed by the end of the year.
It's not a problem to solve one day, but the idea of a 4-day working week is consistent with the Party's approach to maintaining economic balance, as well as the Party's industrial warfare."
The Leborist party will not be the first to accept such an idea, because the Canadian party has also promised a 4-day work week throughout the 2017 campaign.
But this idea is still not fully addressed by the Leborist party.
The Labour Party spokesperson said: 4 days' work week is not a party policy, and is not seen by the party.
John McDonald had organized my conference for the Leborists to represent the socialist revolution in the economy to realize its vision.
McDonald said he decided to reassess the distribution of power among the poor leaders and the "robbers."
Well, the department of water companies is not going to get their share of the state-of-the-art award, because the Leborist party can make cuts taking into account a number of shortcomings.
He also stated that he was planning to make 10 percent of the companies' savings and hand it over to workers who spent up to 500 euros in a common payment.
Lindsey's Gram, John Kennedy, told the 60-minute magazine that the research director's board would change his opinion about Cavano.
Research Bureau's follow-up against Judge Brett Cavano has delayed the final vote in the Supreme Court for his appointment for at least one week.
During a Sunday interview, a 60-minute newspaper official asked Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Grame if the research board could force them to change their mind.
Kennedy was more independent than his South Carolina colleague.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
I said, "I'm going to take part in hearings, I'm going to have a conversation with Cavano.
I called him when the charge was filed, and I said, "You did it."
He was determined, without hesitation.
The gram is still as silent as the fish.
"I have an opinion on Brett Cavano, and that's an unjustified accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know that Brett is clearly denying it," Grem added, addressing Christian Leslie Ford.
"And all those he's pointing at can't establish it.
This is a 36-year story.
I don't see any new changes.
What is a Global Civil Society event, and will it reduce poverty?
This week, New York will be hosting the Global City Event, the annual music event that is attended by amazing star groups in a wonderful mission to reduce poverty.
This is the 7th year that tens of thousands of people gather in the central garden not only to enjoy the achievements of Janet Jackson, Cardi Bi and Shaw Mendes, but also about the basic purpose of the event to raise, it's to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Civil Event, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Programme, an international defence group aimed at increasing the number of active combatants to end poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event, if of course you don't want VIP tickets, you need to do a few things, like volunteering, sending the governing bodies e-mails, making phone calls, and a number of other actions to eliminate poverty.
The global citizen has been able to accomplish his goal.
Is it a good idea to reward people with a free ticket, that they just feel good about the idea that they can only send emails by changing something?
Global citizens have said that since 2011, 19 million of their supporters have taken action for various purposes.
It is said that these actions have helped to appeal to world rulers and to raise over $37 billion, which can change the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In 2018, a group of 390 calls and calls were made, which has already raised some $10 billion.
The group says that the funds can directly target some 659 million people in the world.
The Kochers have been directed primarily by the Food Force, a United Kingdom investor company whose idea is to develop the full power of children. After receiving a letter from a global citizen of 4,700, he promised to give Rwanda $35 million to put an end to the disability.
"We can join the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments and global citizens in their support, including you, in writing in history about social injustice against corruption," said Tracy Ulman at her live concert in London in 2018.
The group also announced that the United Kingdom, through more than 5,000 actions undertaken to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, has decided to fund the Nutrition Force for a programme that will help provide food for 5 million women and children.
One of the most enjoyable questions on web sites is, "What makes you believe that we can end poverty."
Global citizen answers, "This is a long and difficult path, there will be both failures and failures.
Like civil rights and anti-circumvention movements before us, we're going to be successful because we're strong together.
Janet Jackson, Vincent, Shaw Mendes, Caddy Bin, Janel Mona are among the stars that have come to participate in the New York event, whose guests are Deborah Lee Furnes and Hugo Jackman.
Minister of the Interior, "The United States can use the shipyard to ban Russian energy exports."
"If desired, Washington could use the Russian power supply to prevent its shipyard, including the Middle East," the U.S. Army of National Affairs quoted Washington Examiner as saying.
The army added that Russia's participation in Syria, especially when it's a government's legal invitation, is new to find new markets.
"I believe they will sell their energy in the Middle East, as they do in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means of solving it.
"The United States, with the help of our shipyard, has the opportunity to make sure that the sea basins are open, and, if necessary, can block them to ensure that their energy does not enter the market," he said.
Zincen was addressing participants who were hosted by the Energy Consumers' Dashin -- a non-commercial organization that represents him as the "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He went to compare Washington's approaches to cooperation with Russia and Iran, saying they were basically the same.
"Iran's and Russia's economic choice, rather than much, is a substitute for fuel and the best use," he said, presenting Russia as a "one-in-one-time fuel-based economy."
According to the announcements, the Tromp administration was carrying out its mission to add liquid natural gas to Europe's exports, replacing Russia with a cheaper version for European consumers.
To that end, officials of the Tromp's administration, including US President Donald Tromp, were trying to persuade Germany to reject the "unresponsible" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Tromp, has become Moscow's "slander".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that, at $11 million, the North Stream 2 pipeline, which is built with an available gas pipeline power of up to 110 square meters, is just an economic project.
Kremlin argues that being fierce against Washington's project is just an economic justification and an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we are unanimous in that energy cannot be a tool for the application of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, after a meeting in Moscow with US Energy Secretary Rick Pery in September.
The U.S. position was opposed to Germany, which restored the stability of the project.
The German Industrial Organization, the German Industrial Federation (GAF), has urged the United States to stay away from European energy policy and from bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third side interferes with our energy supply," said President Daetr Kemp of the German Industrial Federation (GAF) President Angela Merkel and President Vladimir Putin after the last meeting of President of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren will pay close attention to participating in the presidential elections in 2020," said Massachusetts Senator.
Senator Elizabeth Varen of Massachusetts said that he would pay close attention to participating in the presidential elections on the Sabbath after the election.
In Hollywood, Massachusetts, at a meeting with the public, Warren confirmed that he was thinking about being asked.
"The woman's time has come to go to Washington and correct our corrupt government, and that includes the ruling woman," he said, according to Hill.
"After November 6, I will pay close attention to the President's task."
At a meeting with the public, Warren expressed his opinion on President Donald Trump, saying that he "takes this country in the wrong direction."
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," he said.
Varen was honest in his criticism of the trial and of the Supreme Court, Brett Cavin.
On Saturday, in Twitter, Warren said, "Of course we need HDB research before we vote."
Thursday's question, however, showed that most of Varen's own trustees believe that it should not be proposed by 2020.
According to a survey conducted by the political research center/Boston Globe at Suffolk University, fifty percent of Massachusetts's likely voters said the senator should not be proposed.
Twenty percent of the people were on the side of that.
The question showed that, in the past, Deval Patrick had more supporters, 38 percent were on his side, and 48 percent were on his side.
Other important democratic names, which have been hit in the list of potential bidders in 2020, include former Vice President Jo Byden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Byden said he'd officially decide in January, says the Associated Press.
Sara Palin, during the Donald Trump public meeting, talks about the postpartum stress disorder of Trace Palin.
Trak Palin, 26 September, spent a year in Iraq.
On Tuesday night, he was arrested and tortured for family violence.
"What goes through is my son, through whom he goes back," he said to the public in Talsa, "and I can approach other families who feel the consequences of the subsequent stress disorder and the wounds that our soldiers are returning to," he said to the audience in Oklahoma Donald Trump.
Palin called his arrest "in a friend's room" and said about his friend and other veterans in the war that "they return a little bit changed, they come back tense, they come back, wondering if they'll find respect for everything they have given to this country by their shipowners and pilot friends and other members of the military."
He was arrested in Vasila, Alaska, on Monday, and subjected to domestic violence against his wife, according to a report on the use of weapons under family violence and alcohol, according to Dan Banette of the Vasila Police Department.
18 states, Washington supports the challenges of a new asylum policy.
The seventeen states and the area of Colombia support the legal challenges of the new U.S. policy, which refuses to provide refuge to those fleeing from criminal or family violence groups.
Representatives of 18 states and districts in Washington, D.C., were briefed as a court adviser to support the politics of asylum seekers, NBC News writes.
The guest's full name is Grace V. Augustus. The guest's credentials against the US Civil Liberties Association's fund-raiser policy have not been discovered.
He said to his partner, "and the boys of his violent criminal group," offended him, but on July 20, U.S. officials refused to provide him with asylum.
He was arrested in Texas.
Greek-backed state lawyers El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, providing a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, represented as nations that have constant problems with criminal groups and family violence.
The new policy of US refugees was contrary to the 2014 decision of the Immigrant Review Board, which allowed non-documented immigrants to seek asylum.
Chief Justice Carl Rassi of Colombia said on Friday that the new policy "respects the state, state and international law that has existed for decades".
"The state law requires all asylum visits to be tried on the basis of clear evidence and circumstances of visits, and such a prohibition does not maintain that principle," the court counsel said briefly.
After the arguments, the issue was briefly discussed that the policy of refusing entry of immigrants is detrimental to the US economy, saying that they are probably contractors and "requirers of labour".
Chief Justice Jeff Sessions ordered the immigrants' judges to no longer provide refuge to the Union from criminal groups and to the victims of domestic violence.
"The support is for those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or special social group or political opinion," said the session in its statement on politics on June 11.
The restaurant never intended to solve all the problems, even all the serious problems that people all over the world face every day.
In Palu, desperate efforts are being made to save the fighting because the deaths were repeated on the way to find the fighters.
The situation for the combatants was rather shocking.
"It was very heavy," said 35-year-old mother to Risa Cussama, looking after a little boy who had a high fever in the divided town of Palu.
"Every minute, the ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is low."
They've seen people come back to their ruined homes, take their things out of the mud, and try to save everything they've found.
Hundreds of people were injured, and 7.5 balloons were filled with hospitals that were damaged by the earthquake.
Some of the victims, including Dui Harris, who had broken their back and shoulders, were in the Palusi Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside because of ongoing force searches.
His tears filled his eyes as he told how he felt when a violent earthquake shook the room of the five-story hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save us.
I was pushed under the walls, I think," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was participating in a wedding in the city.
I heard my wife call for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe.
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of threatening advertising.
A week later, when the U.S. official newspaper of China published a four-page ad in the U.S., complimenting the Chinese-U.S. trade preferences every day, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of advertising through the U.S. media.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the addition of the Chinese newspaper Des Moines Register, to the largest sales paper in the state of Iowa, accusing China of holding elections at the US Congress on 6 November, accusing China of refusing to do so.
The charges that Beijing was trying to mediate the U.S. elections showed what the U.S. officials told Reuters, that it was a new step in China's escalating propaganda.
Although it's normal for foreign governments to place a commercial to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now in the midst of a devastating trade war, which has brought them into line with each other's integrations.
In the earlier phase of the Chinese trade war, anti-circumvention skeptics were thinking of hitting exporters from states like Ayowa, who led the Tromp's National Party, say American and Chinese experts.
Ambassador Terry Brunsted to China, the former US Ambassador to China's largest agricultural products, says that China has hit American workers, farmers and businessmen.
As Brunsted wrote in the column of the Sunday Des Moines Register, "In our own free home country, China is now reversing this persecution."
"By posting a payout advertisement in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government uses the dedicational tradition of freedom of speech and speech in America," he wrote.
"On the contrary, given that Mamul is under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party, here, in the paper on Peking Street, you can find a limited number of opposite views and it is impossible to see the real reflection of the different opinions that Chinese can have on China's worrying economic path," he wrote.
He added that "One of China's most famous papers has avoided" to publish an article from his proposal, even though he didn't mention what it was about.
Public officials at the Kavano Warca stage are leading women's electorate in the middle of the elections, warning analysts
However, very high-level citizens remain in their position and defend the post of member of the Supreme Court to Brett Cavano, despite several charges of sexual violence, analysts have warned that they will be affected in the pre-trial elections, especially by women.
Feelings about this have been too loud, and most citizens have officially declared that they want to continue voting.
"It's impossible to turn things around," said Professor Grant Reicher, professor of politics at the University of Syracuse, on Sunday.
Rihrer said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flexy (Arisona) would be sufficient to relax the angry voters on the need to investigate the HDB.
"Women will not forget what happened last night; they will not forget it tomorrow, nor November," according to the Washington newspaper, "on Friday, the largest adviser and national spokesperson for the MoveOn Progress Group, Karen Jean-Pierer.
On Saturday morning, when the members of the Judicial Committee decided to appoint Cavano as a member of the Supreme Court, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaise's Förde, the audience shouted "November is coming," during a protest between the Senate.
"The inspiration and motivation of the democrats will be enormous," non-participative political analyst Steve Rottenberg told the news site.
"People say it's already high, that's right.
But it may be higher, especially for non-declared voters in the extremes, as well as for 18-29 young voters who do not like the president, but often do not participate in the elections."
Even before Ford's public testimony on sexual harassment claims against a member of the Supreme Court, analysts were suggesting that if citizens decided to establish his conviction, there could be an impact.
"This has become a confusion for the public party," former president of the National Committee of the Republic said earlier last week, "Michael Steele," reported NBC News.
"The speech is not only about the committee's vote or the final vote, or about whether Cavano will become a member of the court, but also about how citizens have approached the issue and how they have reacted to it," said Gai Cecil, who runs the Priorities USA Group, who helps choose Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to have a little bit of a split about who to believe after the Ford and Cavano demonstrations, and recently the number of Ford's performers has increased a little bit.
The new YouGov question shows that 41 percent of respondents probably believe in the Ford show, and 35 percent probably believe in Cavano.
In addition, 38 percent think that Cavano has probably lied in his demonstrations, and 30 percent say the same about Ford.
After Fly's claim, HDB is now investigating Ford, and at least one other prosecutor -- the charges imposed by Deborah Ramirez -- reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judicial Committee that Cavano was drunk at 17 years of age.
Ramirez claims that the candidate in the Supreme Court's office showed him his sexual organs when they attended the ceremony at Eli's University in 1980.
The world's leader is planning to create new networks to compete with Google and Facebook
Team Bernards-Leen, the creator of world-class Sardinia, opens the ceiling that will strive to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on an open-source Berners Lee on Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and who will be able to access it.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Bernards-Leine joked that the purpose of Inrupt is "to own the world."
"We have to do this now," he said about the truth.
"This is a historic moment."
The program uses Solid's technology to enable people to create their own web store.
It can contain contact lists, make-up lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all accessible in one browser at a time.
The key feature of the personal data storage is that the user himself decides who the information can be.
The company calls it "the extension of personal rights and opportunities through data"
According to Chief Executive John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company provides resources, procedures and skills to help to make Solid accessible to everyone.
Currently, the company is made up of Bernards-Leigh, Bruce, the IBM security platform, a number of static programmers who have been admitted to work on the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
Since this week, technology developers around the world have been able to create their concentrated additions using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Bernards-Leen said he and his team don't talk to Facebook or Google about whether to invest a total change in places where their business models change completely in one second.
"We don't ask their permission."
On the Sabbath, in a recording published in Medium, Bernards-Leine wrote that Inrupt's mission is "to provide commercial energy and ecosystem that will help to protect the integrity and quality of the new solid-based network."
In 1994, Berners-Leen transformed the Internet when he founded the World War II.
In recent months, Berners-Leen has been a powerful voice in discussions about network neutrality.
Even when I run Inrupt, the Berners-Leen will remain the founder and manager of the World Sardostan Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm an unimaginable optimist for this next century," added Bernards-Leen.
Bernard Van: A clergyman worthy of the Victorian Crusade during World War I
The only minister of the Church of England who won the Battle of Victoria during World War I was raised in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant General, Father Bernard Van was awarded this award on September 29, 1918, at the time of the attacks on Bellanglis and Leukur.
But four days later, he was killed by a dipukharai, not knowing that he was awarded the highest military prize in Britain.
On a Sunday in Russden, Northamptonshire, two of his grandsons opened a memorial.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said, and "it's too symbolic," that the memorial will be opened just 100 years after his grandfather's worthy act.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant General Bernard Van led his money through Kentas St. Quentin's "a lot of wildfires and wildfires".
And then he rushed to the fire and he pushed the line forward with the greatest civility, and he took a single shot of the field, and he broke three jockeys.
The lieutenant general was killed by a German dipukhara on October 4, 1918, a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Van said his grandfather's actions are "something I know I'll never be worthy of, but worthy of respect."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also put on a flower bouquet after the brentwood Imperial youth orchestra.
Michael Van said "it is a great honor to form part of the market" and added that "the dignity of real hero is shown in the support shown by many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, but instead they saw Dog Peppa
Imagine that you didn't sleep all night watching Bellator 206 in the lobby only because they wouldn't let you see the main event.
San José was expecting 13 November, including 6 majors, to be shown straight in the 5th wave of the United Kingdom.
At the time of 6th -- just when the Glade Musas and Rory MacDonald were going to fight each other, TV viewers were surprised in the United Kingdom when they started showing Péppa.
Many were not impressed because they had been left alone until morning for a special battle.
One of the pilgrims described this passage on Twitter to a child's crowd as a "distant joke."
"It's a state order, according to which it's not appropriate at 6 o'clock, so they had to pass through childhood messages," said Bellator's Senior Interchanger Dave Schwarz, on the line of marketing and communication.
"Yes, Peppa. "
The president of the Bellator company, Scott Cooker, said that they're going to work on their schedule so that UK TV viewers can be included in the future.
"When I think about repetition, I think we can do it," Coker said.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday, we can't do it until six o'clock on Sunday, which is already two weeks.
But we're working in that direction.
Believe me, when the message was changed there was a lot of messages, and none of them were loving.
We were trying to fix the situation, we thought it was a technical grass.
But it wasn't, it was a state-level problem.
I can promise you that this will never happen again.
We're going to cut the number of battles to 5, as we usually do, we tried to give more to the fans, but we failed.
This is an emergency."
Desert Island Discs. Tom Daley felt lower because of sexual orientation
Olympian Susser Tom Dale says he's grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexual orientation, but it has motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that until high school she didn't realize that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking at the presentation of Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, which was the first time that Lauren Lavorn was driving, he said that he had expressed himself about the rights of homosexuals to "hope" others.
He also said that after becoming a parent, he was less interested in winning the Olympics.
Kirst Young, the permanent director of a long-term show, stopped for months because of his illness.
In his first speech to Gooder, Dale said that when she grew up, she felt "less" than others because "love for boys and girls was unacceptable in society."
And he said, Even to this day are these feelings of inferiority and inferiority which really make me feel better.
He said he wanted to prove something from him so that people wouldn't be disappointed knowing about his sexual orientation.
The double bronze medalist of the Olympic Games has become an outstanding defender of LGBT rights and has been involved in the cooperation games in Australia this year, calling for more countries to improve their solidarity.
He said it was expressed because he had brought his luck to live open, without consequences, and wanted to inspire others.
The three world champions said that in 2013 a man named Dustin Lance Black, American film director, was "a surprise" for him.
The other year, Dale married the director of the Oskar, who's 20 years old, but says the age difference has never been a problem.
He said, "When you're so young, you're going through this kind of thing -- she's been at her first Olympics at the age of 14, and her father died of cancer three years later," he found it hard to find someone from the age who passed through the same settlements.
The couple became the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Dale in June, and Dale says that "the whole possibility" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, I'd say the whole goal is to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are more things than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbin."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died of cancer at the age of 40 in 2011.
Dale said his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked for was that if he won London-2012 games, he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Father, you won't be in the first row,' he said.
"I had caught his hand when he stopped breathing, and only from the moment he stopped breathing and died, I finally realized that he was not insensitive," he said.
Next year, Dale participated in the 2012 Olympics and won the Bronze Medal.
"I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life: to wake up in front of the Olympic audience at home, there couldn't be a better feeling," he said.
It also affected the choice of his first song, which was Heizer Small's Proud, which accompanied him to prepare for the Olympics all the time, and from which he's still torn.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday, British time at 11:15 BST.
Michelson, who lives in a bad neighborhood, is in storage at Ryder’s yard on a Sabbath
The American Phil Michelson will set a record on the Sabbath when I play his 47th game in Ryder's yard, but he'll have to work on his sports if he doesn't want it to become an accident.
12th time in a two-year competition, but coach Jim Furick left him in the storage room on Sunday at the games.
Instead of being in the center of events, as has often been the case, the winner spent half his day as a fan, and the other half working on his playground trying to correct what was bothering him.
The 48-year-old coach, who wasn't even the top of his career among the first hits, is not an ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf National field, where the inconveniences usually punish the bad hits.
And even if the field isn't so scared of itself, Michelson's 9th Sunday is going to meet the British Open Championship, Francisco Molinari, who has formed a team of young Tommy Fitwood hey, winning all the games this week.
If the Americans, who are together 4 before the 12 individual games, start well, Michelson's game can be decisive.
Fury's told his boys no more than he had to say.
"He fully understood the role of his day, touched my shoulder, hugged me, and said he'd be ready tomorrow," said Fury.
"He has great confidence in his might.
He's included in the Hall of Glory, and he's given so much to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I was planning more, but that's how it was done, and that's what I think is the way we should choose.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Michelson's going to go beyond Nick Faldo's record of playing the biggest game in the Ryder Square.
This could be the end of his career in Ryder's yard, which has never really matched the heights of his personal indicators.
Michelson has 18 wins, 20 wins, and 7 none, although Furick says his presence adds something unimaginable to the team.
"He's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's like, he likes to play jokes on people's heads, and he's a great team," he explained.
"I think young players have also had fun playing games this week, and it was fun to follow it.
He's giving a lot more than playing."
Europe’s older Thomas Byron knows that a great advantage can soon be lost
The European elder Thomas Byrne knows from his experience that a considerable advantage before the final games of Ryder's yard can easily become an uncomfortable course.
Denmark had its first game in 1997 in Walderama, where the top team of the White Ballesters had a 5-unit advantage over the Americans, but the final score was slightly different from 141⁄2-131/2:
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advantage in Walderama, where we lost, as well as in Walderama, where we won, but with a small advantage," said Byrne, after he saw how the 2018 team won 5-3 on Friday and evening, in total 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone that this isn't the end.
Tomorrow you'll show your best.
Come out and do everything right.
Nothing's finished as long as you have units on the chart.
We're going to try to win this prize, and that's what we're focused on.
I've always said that I focus on our team of 12 players, but we also know who's on the other side -- the world's best players.
Wondering how his players showed themselves in the hard golf course, Byron added, "I've never been superior to myself in this work.
Tomorrow's a full all-time story.
Tomorrow is a personal talk, and it's a whole different thing.
It's nice to be with a playmate when things are going well, but when you're alone, you're going through a whole trial as a golfer.
This is the message you have to get the players to do the best you can tomorrow.
Now therefore let your friend who is at home do that which is better for him tomorrow.
Unlike Byorney, his partner Jim Furick expects his players to be better off on their own than they were as a couple, except for Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, who won 4 out of 3.
Fury himself has been on both sides of this last day's tour -- he's been a member of Brooklyn's winning team, and then he's in the losing position, and the poor European girl is out of "Medina's miracle."
"I remember every damn word of it," he said, in reply to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the senior of 1999 was to gather his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you'd like us to go right from the beginning, as was done in Brooklyn and in Medina.
When that movement starts to work in some way, it puts a lot of pressure on these average games.
We choose our composition accordingly and give the boys that tomorrow we will try to do a miracle."
Thomas has been commissioned to try to control the fight, he will meet Rory McCillroy in the main game, the other half of Europe's Paul Casey, Jastine Rose, and Yoon Raham are Tommy Flitwood and Jan Polter.
"I've chosen the boys in this order, because I think it's the right order from the beginning to the end," said Byron about the players he chose.
Germany’s new military operation was delayed once again
The new German Armed Forces Freight had to be deployed in 2014 to replace the wartime warrior Sar, but at least by the end of the year, it would not happen because of the unsustainable systems and the growing costs, the local media reported.
The operation of the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg order has been delayed until the first half of 2019, the Die Zeit newspaper cites the words of the military spokesman.
The ship had to bring the Soviet forces together in 2014, but the alarming problems that ensued after the delivery hindered the implementation of the stormy project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the Soviet forces had ordered in 2007, will come to replace the old Bremen frigates.
They're supposed to be packed with a powerful antenna, a number of anti-aircraft and suspicious sparks, as well as some secret technologies, such as reduced radio transmitters, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer service hours; new frescoes must be able to move away from local ports for up to 2 years.
But continuous delays mean that the super-modern warriors, who say they're going to let Germany grow out of the country, are already getting older when the acquisition is delivered, says Die Time.
Charabastic F125 frigates appeared in headlines last year in the newspaper when German military forces refused to use the ship and returned it to the Hamburg Blohm & Voss shipping company.
This was the first time that after the ship was delivered, the Soviet forces returned it to the shipping company.
There's little known about the reasons for the return, but the German mammule mentions a number of key "programmatic and technical shortcomings" that would render the war useless if sent to a martial mission.
The program flaws were particularly important, because the Baden-Wuerttemberg ship would be served by a team of 120 sailors, which is part of the team of the former Bremen crew.
In addition, it turns out that the ship is very heavy, which reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the Soviet forces to make further improvements.
It's said that with 7,000 tons of weight, the Rhineland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as the ships of the same order that Germany used in World War II.
In addition to ingenious devices, the whole value of the project, including the preparation of personnel, also becomes a problem.
It's said it's from the original €2.2 billion to the amazing €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The problems with the new frigates are also becoming more important in the light of the latest warnings about the weakening of the German military power.
Earlier this year, President Hans-Peter Barthells of the Defence Committee of the Council of Germany acknowledged that the Soviet forces are in fact "eating ships that can be placed."
The officer said that the problem had grown over time because the old ships had been removed from use, but had not been replaced.
He complained that the Baden-Wuerttemberg Frogs and none of them were able to assemble the Rahmenho forces.
National Trust hides the secret life of girls
A new research conducted in a prison in the mountainous world of Scotland aims to find out how little girls use landshaft to find food.
It's hopeful that the results will shed new light on the behavior of individual birds flying, and help them to continue their conservation.
The research carried out by scientists at the National Trust in Scotland will be followed by regular and enjoyable girls, as well as by the oldest and youngest girls at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester-Ross.
Special recorders will be placed on the main site around the prison, which will monitor the activities of infants throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
The expert analysis of all the recordings will illustrate the frequency of voice signals for girls, identify what kind of things are being done.
Then there's a map of the natural environment and a report to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
The NTSC conservation consultant Rob Durer hopes that the results will reveal what natural environments are most important for infants, and how they are used by every kind of species.
This information will help to identify the advantages of environmental governance, such as the creation of pearls, and will help to determine how best to preserve forests for girls and other species.
In Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom, the number of girls living in the last hundred years has declined significantly.
They're at risk because of construction and development work that affects the environment of girls.
The wind turbines and the light can also be dangerous, as well as the paper and chemical processing of materials for shells and the attacks by domestic cats.
The girls are not really blind.
But because of the habit of hunting at night, their ears are more useful than the eyes when it comes to catching time.
They use a complex sound-location technique to find insects and prevent their flight.
NTS, which is responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land, is very serious about girls.
It's got 10 trained experts who do research periodically, check the habitats, and sometimes do rescue work.
The organization even founded a ban on the first and only girls in Scotland in the Thrave Prison, in Damfis-and-Galway, where they live in the 8 species of 10 girls in Scotland.
The governor of the prison, David Thompson, says that detention is an ideal area for them.
"Here in Thrave, we have a huge area for girls," he says.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees, which are all good places.
But not much is yet known about girls, so the work we do here and in other prisons will help us better understand what we need to do to make them happy."
He stressed that it was important to check that there are girls and that there are new conservation jobs inside the detention facility, because the accidental destruction of one habitat can kill up to 400 females and young girls, so it's possible to destroy the entire local population.
Girls are protected and it's illegal to kill them, persecute them, prevent them, or destroy them.
Elizabeth Ferel, from the Scottish Girls Conservation Foundation, urged the population to join in helping them.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn about girls, and we don't know how they live."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape, and experts are preparing to explain the German magazine
Cristian Ronaldou's charges of rape against him have been described as "false news," saying that people want to use their name to "announce them."
His lawyers are going to explain the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker in Portugal and Yuventus is accused of raping an American woman, Catherine Mayorga, in 2009 at the Las Vegas Hotel.
He was found to have paid him $375 000 to remain silent about the case, and Der Spiegel announced it on Friday.
A few hours after the charges were filed, the recording's direct if she spoke to her 142 million followers in the video, Ronaldo, 33, called the announcements "false news."
‘No, no, no, no, no:
What they say today is false news," the winner of the Golden Ginger told the camera five times.
"They want to announce themselves, using my name.
It's natural.
They want to be known by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's very good," smiling added the player.
According to Reuters, Ronaldou's lawyers are going to try Der Spiegel on the charges they call "personally unacceptable."
Advocate Christian Scherz said that the player is reparating for "the extent of the severity of the crime for psychological damage, which is probably one of the most serious cases of personal rights violations in recent years."
They say the alleged incident happened in the guest room in Las Vegas in June 2009.
According to the documents presented in a night club in the district court in Nevada, Ronald and Mayorga went to the playroom where he probably raped her.
Majorga claims that Ronald, after the accident, fell down his feet and told him that he was "99 percent" "good boy", which was wrong because of "one percent."
The papers show that Ronald agreed that the couple had sexual relations, but that was in mutual agreement.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and had photos of her injuries in the hospital, but then she agreed without the court's problem, because she "feared revenge" and didn't want to "damage the public."
The 34-year-old woman says that she now wants to avoid that solution, because she's still suffering the consequences of that alleged incident.
Ronald had almost joined Royal Madrid Manchester, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Youth, with a €100 million deal.
Brixit: England, "I'll regret it forever" to lose car manufacturers.
England will forever regret him if he loses his reputation as the world's leading automaker after Brexit, Minister of Economics Greg Clarke said.
He added that it was "anxious" when Toyota, England, told the BBC that if England left Europe without a deal, it would temporarily stop production in the factory near Derby.
"We need a business," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automanufacturer said that without the company's Brexit, border delays can cause job losses.
The brand produced by Toyota Auris and Avensis last year produced about 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to other countries in Europe.
"My view is that if England comes out of Europe at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory," said Marvin Kuk, CEO of Brunastny Toyota.
Other auto-producer companies in England have expressed concern about how cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, will work without any agreement.
BMW, for example, says that in a month after Brexit, it's going to shut down its Mini product in Oxford.
According to auto-producer companies, their main concern is not about the risks of the supply chain in the Brexit case.
Toyota's production is based on the "right time" principle, where the parts of the cars are ordered from England and Europe's suppliers every 37 minutes.
If, on March 29, England leaves Europe without a trade, there will be barriers that producers think can lead to delays in parts and deficits.
Toyota would be impossible to wait in his Derbishir factory for more than one day, the company said, and so the production would stop.
Mr. Clarke said that the Chequers program for future relations with Teresa May in Europe "will be clearly weighed down by the time limit checks".
"We need a deal: we want the best deal to allow us, as I say, not just to be successful here, but to take advantage of this opportunity," he said in the BBC Radio 4 today's programme.
"Not only does the facts of Toyota, but other manufacturers show that we really need to continue to have high-efficiency supply chains."
Toyota couldn't tell when the product would stop, but he warned that long-term added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the product and ultimately cut jobs.
Peter Zuvalaris, who has worked in Brunast for 24 years and is responsible for the Mass Association, said that his members are very concerned: "It is my experience that if such work goes on, they will no longer return."
The government spokesman said, "We have developed a clear and reliable program of our future relations with Europe."
The Trophie and Rosenstein meeting can be delayed again, says the White House.
The important meeting of Donald Trump and the local judge, Rod Rosenstein, can be delayed in another week, because the fight against Brett Kavinahin by the Supreme Court is continuing, White House said.
Rosenstein is following the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating the media of Russia's elections, the connections between Tromp's aid and Russia, and possible violations of justice by the President.
The question of whether Tromp will remove the main prosecutor's location, and thus threaten the independence of Muller, has been the cause of the bombings in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times announced that Rosenstein had talked to Trompe about the possibility of recording speakers and removing the president from office.
Rosenstein has rejected the announcement.
But last week, he went to the White House, with a banner of statements about his refusal.
Instead, it was announced on Thursday that it was with Tromp, who was currently in the United Nations in New York.
Tramp said he'd prefer not to remove Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a confrontation with the Judicial Council, which was examining the testimony of one of Kavinahi and one of the women accused of sexual violence, Christine Blaise's Förde.
On Friday, Trump ordered the HDB to conduct a one-week investigation of Kavinah's charges, delaying the entire Senate vote.
Sara Sanders, the tramper's secretary, gave a speech on Fox News Sunday.
When they asked him about the meeting in Rosenstein, he said, "The day of the meeting has not yet been scheduled, it could be this week, I think it's going to be delayed another week, taking into account everything that's going on in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, I always love to keep Mamulie informed about the refreshments."
Some journalists don't agree with that announcement, and the Sanders didn't make the White House Mamuli Soulis since September 10.
The reporter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of solos was not due to the opposition to "the show behavior" of television reporters, but he said, "I don't deny the fact that it's the show behavior."
And then he said that the right connection between the Trump and the Mamlus would be bonded.
"The vice president participates in more questions and answers than the other presidents before him," he said, without pointing out any evidence.
The Asulis will still continue," said Sanders, "but if the Council has a chance to ask the US President straight questions, it's better than talking to me.
We've tried a lot to do this, and you've seen that we've been doing this over the past few weeks, and it's going to happen again during the mamuli sulis, where you can talk to the U.S. president."
The tram regularly answers questions when he comes out of the White House or participates in meetings with open meetings or senior officials.
So, it's a rare thing to do with a single mammoth suture.
This week, the president in New York revealed why he's prepared and sometimes a little weird for reporters.
The Minister of Health writes to NHS staff in Scotland about concerns about Brexit.
The Minister of Health has written to the employees of NHS Scotland's Europe to express their gratitude to the country and their desire to remain in Brexit.
MSP Jane Freeman sent a letter that six months after leaving Europe, she would leave.
The government of Scotland is already ready to accept the cost of statements about the status of European citizens in its public services.
In his letter, Ms. Freeman wrote, "The negotiations between England and Europe on leaving in the summer have continued to lead to decisions that are expected to take place this fall.
But the government of England has also promoted its preparation, without the possibility of a business.
I know this is going to be a very bad time for all of you.
That's why, I want to remind you again and again how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of the workforce from an independent nation.
Fellows in Europe and in other areas bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health workers, and benefit the sick and the public that we've lost.
Scotland is exactly your home and we want you to stay here."
Christiana Abercomb is undergoing rapid surgery after head damage.
Cristia Abercombi, a mid-defense defender in the state of Tennessee, has undergone rapid surgery to Vanderbilt Comodore on the Sabbath after his 31-27 loss, reported the loss of his head, Main Organ of Tennessee.
The leading coach in the state of Tennessee, Rod Reid, told reporters that the damage had occurred shortly after the semi-final.
"She walked over the side of the playground and looked like she was in there," said Reid.
The trainers and the medical staff gave Abercomb the oxygen on the side line before moving him to the messenger and sending him further research.
Officer Nashville of Tennessee, Tennessee WSMV, told Chris Harris that Abercomb is being operated at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there's still no detail about the type/degree of damage, and the state of Tennessee is trying to find out when the damage was done.
Abercomb, who has been a second plan player for two years, is running his first race in the state of Tennessee after moving from Illinois.
He had a total of five powerful inventions before he left the game on the Sabbath, which added 18 powerful inventions to his season.
Foreign buyers will pay more for their brand when they buy things in England.
Foreign buyers will pay more for the brand when they buy things in England with the extra money that Thorie's new plan is designed to help the homeless.
This step will counteract the desire to attract young voters from Corbin.
There's going to be an increase in the payroll for those who don't have to pay in England.
The Treasury is planning an annual increase of £120 million to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will pay more for the brand when they buy things in England with the extra money to help the homeless today, Teresa May.
The walk will be seen as an attempt to counter the desire to attract young voters from Corbin to provide more accessible housing and make promises to help those with high income.
There will be an increase in the payroll for people and organizations who don't have to pay in England to save more money to the government to fight the problem of the homeless.
The extra charge on the payout of the present flag, including the purchases of a high-level two years ago -- the second house and the free of charge -- could be equal to three percent.
The Treasury assumes that this will bring £120 million a year.
13 percent of the newly built property in London is purchased by non-English citizens, who raise prices and make it difficult for first-time buyers to get a place.
Very rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "urban cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the city.
A week after Boris Johnson set up a reduction in the payroll, a new policy will be applied, which will allow more young people to buy their first apartment.
He accused large construction companies of exploiting the land but not using it to keep the prices of buildings high and to convince Ms. May to make house arrangements available to solve the "disgusting problem" of England.
Mr. Corbin has announced a series of attractive house modifications, including the supervision of the regimes and the end of the court-owned "unfortunate" aliens.
He also wants to give local self-government bodies great powers to build new houses.
Mrs. May said, "Last year, I said that by my work I would contribute to the restoration of an English dream that life would be better for any new generation.
And that means fixing the broken market in our homes.
England will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it can't be true that it's as easy to buy a house for non-residents and foreign-based organizations as it is for citizens of England who work a lot.
The dream of having a home for many becomes more unattainable, and the contempt of being unattainable becomes more real."
Jack Ross, my main goal is the government of Scotland.
The leader of Sanderland, Jack Ross, says that his "principal goal" is to become the ruler of Scotland at one stage.
Scott (42), enjoys the challenges of rebuilding the North-East club, which is now in third place in League One with three units.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, with St Mirren behind the last season, calling for Scotland's premieres.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B head, and that's it," Rose said to BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
But I grew up seeing my father in Scotland, and that was something that always kept me together.
That possibility would only come if I was the successful leader of the club.
As Sanderland's managers, Ros' ancestors include Dick Advocate, David Moose, Sam Aloris, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keine, and Paolo de Canyon.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he's not worried about following such a large group of people who have previously rejected the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success of this moment will be measured to me by the fact that I will be able to return to the League of Premiers."
Because of the structure and the possibilities of this club, it certainly belongs to the Premier League.
"It's not an easy task to get there, but I'll probably see my success only if I can get the team back there."
Rose's only three years in her manager's career, after being in the governor's office in Dubarton, and after 15 months in Hearts' leadership.
He then helped Alloa recover after the third phase of the descent, and changed St Mirren from the descent to the next season called the winner.
And Ros says he now feels better than he ever did in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real two-choice," he said about taking over Alloa's responsibility.
I honestly believe that the government was right for me, more than playing.
It sounds weird because I was playing well, and I'm getting a good living from it, and I'm enjoying some important heights.
But playing can be difficult.
There's plenty of things you need to go through during the week.
I'm still going through this with work stress and pressure, but governance is more personal.
I've always wanted to rule, and now I'm doing it, and I feel much more comfortable than what I've done in my adult life.

According to research, it's a great time to drink at 5:30 a.m. on the Sabbath.
Summer heat provides revenue flow for England's fighting goods, but it also increases the pressure on restaurant networks.
According to indicators, goods groups have 2.7 percent sales growth in July, but restaurant revenues are down by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, from the CGA's business consulting company that discovered the data, said, "The continued heat situation and, above all, the world's expected long participation in England, forced Jules to follow the example of June the following month, when the profits of goods grew by 2.8 percent, except for restaurants that suffered more.
The fall of 1.8 percent of Junis' restaurants was worse for Julis.
Drinking has made the pool work better than reducing the work of restaurants.
Food has also reduced the work of the factory in the summer, yet not as bad as the work of restaurants.
It looks like people are just going out for a drink.
The sales of soap and beverages have grown by 6.6 percent over a month, and the food has decreased by three percent.
Paul Niuman said from the RSM analysis of entertainment and hospitality: these results continue to reflect what we have seen since the end of April.
The direct and important influence of social and sporting events continues to be the biggest factor when it comes to the sale of outside the home market.
It's not surprising that restaurant groups continue to fight, although the fall in sales levels of 4.8 percent of the year-on-year will particularly affect the current highest costs.
The long, hot summer couldn't be a worse time for food producers, and it would become clear in time whether the lighter temperature that would be for August would be some kind of security.
The overall growth in the sales of pubs and restaurants, including the new ones, was 2.7 percent in July, affecting the decreases in brand investment.
The monitoring of sales in the UK of Coffer Peach Tracker’s factory, goods and restaurants has been collected and analysed by 47 working groups that had a total income of £9 and that is a certain indicator of the field.
One out of five has a secret social media account he's hiding from his parents.
According to research, one 11-year-old has a secret social media account that he hides from his parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the growth of fake Insta pages.
This news has reinforced the fear that sexual information is spreading
Twenty percent of the students said they have a "main" account to show their parents.
One of the 11-year-olds is creating social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth of the fake Insta pages, linking it to the Instagram website.
That news has reinforced the fear that sexual information is spreading.
Twenty percent of the students said they have a clean "main" account to show their parents, while also having personal accounts.
A mother who has discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret site has discovered a young man who convinces others "to rape her."
A survey conducted by the Conference of Directors of Digital Awareness UK and private schools (HMC) revealed that 40 percent of the 11-18 years old have two accounts, half of which accept that they have a personal account.
HMC leader Mike Bücken said: "It is disturbing that so many young people are tempted to create online platforms where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Ellie Doyle is going to be "the voice of the athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Council.
Ellie Doyle, in Scotland's Athletics Council, at the annual governing body's main meeting, was elected as a non-executive director.
Doyle is Scotland's most respected lightweight athlete, and President Ian Bide said that this is a good opportunity for sports leaders to benefit from his international experience in the last decade.
"Ely has great respect for Scotland, England and the world's athletes, and we are convinced that giving her advice will bring great benefits to the Atlantic in Scotland," Biddi said.
Doll said, "I will work with great love as an athlete's voice, and I hope that I will really sleep and help with sports in Scotland."
The American who won 200 and 400 meters in the 1996 Atlantic Games, and has a total of four Olympic Olympics, and now the BBC's permanent interpreter, has lost his ability to walk after a transient ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter, "A month ago, I was beaten this day.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it's only time to show me if I'm going to get better and to what extent.
It was a hard job, but I was completely healthy, I learned how to walk again, and now I'm doing motion exercises.
Thank you for encouraging messages."
The Christmas pump advertisement that compares mothers to cows spreads online opinion.
The Christmas pump organization's online idea is to spread a commercial that compares feeding mothers to milking cows.
Elvie, a consumer technology company, released a lightweight music video, an advertisement that shows what freedom the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a grassy barn under a song that has similar words, "Yes, I will, but you don't see any puppies," and "if you don't see them, they're not the other ones, but they're my kisses."
The band continues, "Move them out, push them out, I feel it, little one, push them out, push them out, I'll shoot them."
However, the ad posted on the company's Facebook page, online, has been the subject of a debate.
With 77,000 diodes and hundreds of comments, video viewers have received a variety of responses, many of which say it's a joke about the "fears" of dairy production.
"It was a very bad decision to use cows for advertising.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to have milk, except that they don't steal their children a few days after they were born," wrote one person.
Elvie's breast pump is suddenly placed in the feeding pad (Elvie/Mother).
Another said, "It's understandable how tragic it is for a mother and a child."
But, yes, why don't you use them to advertise the birth pump to the mothers who buy it to keep their children?
Another added, "There's an ad that doesn't have anything to do with reality."
Others have defended the ad, and a woman has admitted that she says the song is "very fun."
I think that's a great idea.
I'd buy one if I'd still eat.
The pump made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I accepted it in the way it was presented.
"This is a wonderful product," said someone.
Another said, "It's a fun ad that beats mothers who sit down (please at their workplace or at the bathroom) and feel like they're with."
This is not an ad that praises or criticizes dairy production."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovered that they were all dancing with hidden pumps.
The idea of propaganda is based on the idea that many women who are going to have their own breasts feel like a cow.
The Elvie pump, however, is quite silent; it has no wire or pipe, and a sudden house is placed in the food fire, which allows the woman to move freely, touch the child, and even go out of the house.
Ana Balirin, mother's ECD and associate, said, "Elvie's pump is a revolutionary product that was worthy of a fast and sophisticated release.
By taking parallels between women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus our attention on the heel of the egg and all its challenges, showing in a fun and relative way the indescribable sense of freedom given by the pump.
This isn't the first time that Elvie pump came into the center of attention.
During London's fashion week, two mothers appeared at the Marta Yakuboski stage using the product.
Hundreds of children of immigrants moved slowly to the camp within Texas.
Although the monthly sections of the border have remained relatively the same, the number of children who have been found to be immigrants has increased rapidly, partly because the strict policy presented by the Tromp team has made it difficult for children to provide shelter.
Usually, many of the supporters themselves were document-free immigrants, and they were afraid to risk being able to stay in the country because they needed a child.
The risk grew in June when state bodies announced that potential supporters and older members of the house would have to present their handcuffs, and that these data would be transferred to the authorities involved in the issues of immigrants.
Last week, Matthew Albens, the director of immigration and tax services, presented to Congress that the service had arrested dozens of people who had come to protect the young.
Then the department confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no previous conviction.
"Approximately 80 percent of the people who are guardians or members of the family of guardians are illegal in the country, and a large portion of them are foreigners.
So we keep looking for these people," said Mr. Albens.
To investigate the children more quickly, officials introduced a new law that might require them to appear in court within one month of their discovery, instead of 60 days, which was, according to the airline, the former standard.
Many will appear through videoconferencing calls, rather than personally presenting themselves, to the immigrant court with a request to legalize their case.
Those who don't meet the requirements will be able to focus quickly.
According to the shelter workers and the reports from the system over the last few months, the longer those children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become gills or depressed, which can lead to rape and runaway experiments.
Experts say that this concern is greater in areas such as Tornillio, where it's easier to see the suffering of children as a result of being large.
They added that moving children to a city of refuge, without providing them with the opportunity to make it psychologically, or to give them the opportunity to say no to friends, can be a trial that many are already suffering.
Syria tells the United States, France and Turkey to take back the occupation forces.
Speaking to the UN's main assembly, International Relations Minister Valid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been fighting for eight years.
Muhammad, who is also an exchanger, said that foreign forces are illegal in the territory of Syria, with the scourge of terrorism, and that they should "be treated accordingly."
"They must leave immediately and without conditions," he said to the assembly.
Mualem claimed that "the war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said, "Damascus shall continue in this holy war until all the borders of Syria are clean, both from the bands of the terrorists, and from the presence of the foreigners of the sea."
The United States has approximately 2,000 military personnel in Syria, mainly teaching or advising the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs, who are against President Bashar al-Asad.
France has more than 1,000 military personnel in the country.
Speaking of refugees, Mualem said that the conditions for their return are good, and he accused "some Western countries" of spreading "international fears," which motivates refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to contribute to this return," he said.
"They politics what must be purely a humane question."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not support the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Asad and his opposing forces to end the war.
UN psychologists say that Russia and Turkey, the last of the revolutions to create a buffer zone in Idlib, have created an opportunity for political negotiations to advance.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a massive attack by Russia's military forces on a state where 3 million people live.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement "has clear deadlines" and hoped that military action would sustain the jihadists, including those associated with Al-Qaida, who were "to be destroyed" in Nusra's state of affairs.
The UN's ambassador, Stefan de Mistura, hopes to soon invite the first letter of the new committee of government and opposition representatives to develop a post for post-war Syria, along the path to elections.
Mualem presented the terms of participation of the Syrian government -- the committee's engagement -- saying that the task force should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against intervention.
Why the Trumpet Will Win the Second Hour
With that logic, Mr. Trump will be elected in 2020, if, as probably, there are many liberal TV viewers, imprisonmenters and scandals will not stop his presidency early.
This will, of course, be "the most tragic end of predominance ever."
At this point, there's no fatigue in television.
Since 2014, stock exchange professionals have grown more than twice in CNN, reaching 1.05 million, and tripled in MSNBC to 1.6 million.
Fox New has an average of 2.4 million peer-to-peer viewers, which by 1.7 million exceeds the four-year-old indicator, says Nilsen, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show is headed by 3.5 million viewers on major news evenings.
"This is a fire that people are looking for, because it's something we don't understand," said Neil Byer, ABC's "Designed Survivor" movie, which tells about a member of the government who becomes president after the attack breaks out in Capital.
Nell Scowell, a comedy veteran, who wrote, "Mine funny things: a few cruel truths about the invasion of Hollywood's boys' club," but has a theory.

She said, "Because he makes me laugh," said Miss.
There's a value for fun in Kaos.
Of course, in a way that's strange to everyone on TV, the electric lines coming from Washington can decide the future of "Roon versus Wayne," whether or not the families of migrants can join and whether or not the global economy is healthy.
Disabling is a payoff that can only be allowed by the most experienced TV viewers.
And yet it goes beyond the limits of being an informed citizen, when you've been following for six hours how a group of experts discuss the use of "unprecedented for printing" sources for Bob Woodwood's book "Unprecedented for Printing", Paul Manafort's $15,000 -- a piece of dress with a solid layer of pride, says Washington Post, and Storm Daniels: Trompy, um, an essential description of anatomy.
I'll never look at Super Mario like I used to.
Speaking about the day-to-day performances of the modified Tromp show and the screenplay (to join the National League of Football, to praise Kim Chen himself), Brand Montgomery, the CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and the creator of Pawn Stars, said, "To make it like a reality fair, he commands you something every day in particular."
You can't let one thing go, you'll stay back.
When I called Mr. Flys this week, it was 80 degrees outside of his house on the northern coast of Kauay, but he was watching MSNBC sitting in the house and at the same time recording CNN.
He couldn't drive himself out, because Brett Kavano was going to meet the Senate Judicial Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court depended on the hair.
"I remember when we were doing these crazy shows in time, people were saying, 'This is the end of Western civilization," Fles told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they turned out to be right."

Dress’s Money Flows to the House of Representatives’ Hard Elections
It's not surprising that a large flow of money is seen in Pennsylvania's 17th election, thanks to the organization of elections, which has resulted in two members of the House of Representatives today fighting for one chair.
In the newly reorganized Pittsburgh electoral district, the current member of the House, Connor Lemb, who was elected in the export elections last spring.
Lamb is competing with another congressional, republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th election in Pennsylvania, which is essentially consistent with the 17th.
The maps were redesigned after last January, when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided that the old elections were non-conventional for citizens.
In the newly formed 17th election, the competition led to a competition between the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lemb became known in Pennsylvania after winning a little bit more in the 18th election of Pennsylvania in March.
For ten years, the chair was occupied by citizens, and President Donald Trump won the election by 20 units.
Political experts give little preference to Democrats.
The United States made it difficult for China to punish El Salvador and then stood up
Diagnos reported that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already met Peking, and were under little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump met with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017, and he also had a hotel in Panama, until his colleagues ran the Trump Organization government team.
State-defence officials have decided to call back the leaders of American diagnostic missions from Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, because of the latest decisions about not knowing Taiwan anymore, Peter Heser Noirt said in a statement earlier this month.
However, the penalties were intended only against Salvador, which had received about $140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed penalties, which included a reduction in financial assistance and a limited restriction on entry visas, would be painful for the Central American country, its high level of unemployment and crime.
At the bottom of the meeting, the North American and Central American officials were slowing down at a high-level convention dedicated to security and economic prosperity and following a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward for migrants in the United States not to allow efforts to be made.
But by mid-September, senior officials of the government realized that they wanted the convention to continue, actually ending the attitudes of punishing Salvador.
It is now expected that Vice President Michael Pens will give a speech at a convention in mid-October, signaling the importance of that meeting by the government, the diagnoses said.
Three American diagnostics returned to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic quietly, without any new strong signals or punishment from Washington.
Mr. Bolton's speech refused to comment on the details of the discussion, which were described by three U.S. officials, including two diagnoses, who agreed to talk about internal discussions, provided that their names would not be published.
Their evaluations were established by a side analyst who also spoke of not revealing the name.

The next step can be the Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller's report on the prevention of justice by the Trompe, which is very clear in public documents.
It's said Mr. Miller's investigation is leading to whether Tromp's campaign of preference has come to a secret agreement with Russia when he attacks our elections.
If there's a change of government in Congress, Mr. Trump will be held responsible for the structure, as he's going to meet voters again, as well as possibly with a social status equal to the audience.
So there are a number of "ifs," and I don't mean to assume that the fall of Mr. Trump or his colleagues in Europe is inevitable.

What are we going to do if Mr. Trump removes the Deputy Chief Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who governs Mr. Muller's investigation.
Rosenstein's been in trouble since this document said that last year he had proposed secretly to the president and had questioned the relevance of his office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times account is wrong.

Ranger Graham Darnes was optimistic before Rapid Vienna.
Rangers have hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over Austria, which followed the impressive results of Spain and Villareal at the beginning of this month, will put them in high places to qualify as Group G in Europe.
Because of the genetic damage, Graham Dorans was not able to participate in his first game of the season until the result of Villareal's 2-2, but he believes Rangers can use that result as a platform for greater work.
"It was a good time for us because Villareal is on the right side," said a 31-year-old.
"We started the game, believing that we were going to get something and get it.
Maybe we could catch it at the end, in general, the result of no one was probably fair.
They were probably better at the first stage and we were better at the second stage.
There's another important European evening on Thursday.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia.
At least 384 people died as a result of a violent earthquake and tsunami that ravaged the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday, officials said, and there is still an increase in deaths.
Because of the loss of phone calls, the experts who were helping out didn't get any information from the Dongalla area, it's an area in the north of Palu, which was the nearest to the 7.5-balloon shock epicenter.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Dongalla on the island of Sulawesi.
Palu Central Sulawesi is the capital of the state of Sulawesi, located on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, rated 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami came.
Dongala is over 300 kilometers (180 miles) long in the north-west coast of the island of Sulawesi.
The district, which is the administrative district, has 299,200 population rated in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the cornerstones of the central Sulawesi region's economy, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
The nickel mining industry is also very important for the region, but it's mostly concentrated in Morowali, opposite Sulawesi.
According to data from the Indonesia Antiquities Office, Palu and Dongala have suffered several times from tsunamis in the last century.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by the tsunami, and hundreds of people were injured in Dongala.
The tsunami also damaged the western part of Dongala in 1996 by killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in a Pacific volcano where earthquakes occur periodically.
Here are the significant earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: The main earthquake in the West Bank of Indonesia occurred in northern Sumatra on 26 December, which affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people in the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: The number of violent earthquakes shook the western coast of Sumatra in early March and April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, not far from the coast of Sumatra.
6.8 in 2006, the balloon earthquake shook the northern part of Java, the most inhabited island in Indonesia, which led to the tsunami in the southern part of the world, killing about 700 people.
9:7.6 Balan earthquake struck the capital of West Sumatra near the city of Padang.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-balloon earthquake shook one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, which led to the creation of about 10 meters of tsunami, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The vertigo earthquake shook the Pidi Jaya area in Aceh, causing destruction and horror, as it reminded people of the deadly and devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
In this case, the tsunami didn't work, but more than 100 people died because of the collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes shocked the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings and caused thousands of visitors to be temporarily concerned.
Sarah Pellyn's older son was arrested for domestic violence.
Three Pileen, the eldest son of Sara Pilein, the former president of Alaska and the deputy president, was arrested on charges of assault.
The 29-year-old Péilin, who lives in the city of Vasilla, has been arrested for domestic violence, domestic violence and opposition during arrest, reports published by the Alaska Police on the Sabbath.
According to a police report, when a woman tried to call a police officer to report alleged crimes, she took the phone.
Peline is under primary custody in Man-Shu, and she's kept under $500, telling KTUU.
On the Sabbath day he stood before the age where, when they asked him to accept the blame, he said, "It's certainly not a sin," the network said.
Pellin's threatening three A classes, which means he can be arrested up to one year at a time and hit $250,000.
He's also charged with Class B crimes, punishable by one day's imprisonment and $200.
This isn't the first time you've been charged with a criminal charge against Pellin.
In December 2017, he was charged with violence against his father, Todd Peley.
His mother, Sarah Péline, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The work is now under review in the "Veterans Court" of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, domestic violence and the indiscriminate use of weapons.
His girlfriend claims to have hit her face.
In 2016, veteran groups subjected Sarah Pellin to severe criticism after she linked her son's violence to post-traumatic stress disorder, which is the result of a sari in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia — Hundreds of Victims
On Saturday, at least 384 people were killed as a result of the earthquake on the island of Sulaves.
7.5 The earthquake caused a tsunami to destroy thousands of homes.
The electricity and communications networks have broken down, and the number of victims has probably increased in the early days.
The earthquake was recorded not far from the center of Sulawesi, the capital of Indonesia, north-east of Jakarta.
The videos on social networks show the moment of the attack.
Hundreds of people were gathered in the city of Palu to participate in the swimming pool when the tsunami shook the beach.
Prosecuting judges demand that the suspicion of a terrorist attack in New York be put to death, which is rare
Chief Justices in New York require the death penalty for Saifulo Saipovo, who is suspected of a terrorist attack that has killed 8 people. This is a rare punishment that has not been implemented in the state since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipo was allegedly hired by the Home Depot truck to attack the North Manhattan Side Motorway, hitchhikers and bikers on the road.
In order to justify the execution, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipo is "decent" to kill 8 victims and "demeanor" to cause serious bodily damage," says the New York Court of Justice, in its statement of intent.
According to a court document, even in two articles, the death penalty is possible.
Weeks after the attack, the jury's oath came under attack on Saipov, presenting him with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for the purpose of money laundering, which the prosecutors usually apply in the case of organised crime, as well as charges of violence and car destruction.
The attack required "planning and observation" -- the prosecutors said -- that Saipo's way of doing breadmaking was described as "disgusting, cruel and immoral."
"Saifulo Habibulievich Saipov has damaged and lost Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Lor Decadti, Darren Drake, Ariel Erligi, Erna Feruchi, Erna Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnuchcho's families and friends," says a statement of intentions.
Five of the victims were Argentinians.
The court in the southern part of New York last time 10 years has been tried for the death penalty.
In September 2009, the accused Khalid Barnes was charged with the murder of two drug addicts and sentenced to a death sentence.
The last time a death penalty was imposed on Julius and Ether Rosenberg in New York in 1953, the married couple were sentenced to death two years ago when their culprits were recognized by the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to judicial documents, Zaipov, a Uzbek citizen, didn't show up after days and nights of conscience trauma.
The police say he's told the investigators that he feels good about what he's done.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching the Islamic state videos on the phone.
He also asked the flag of the Islamic state to hang in his hospital room, the police say.
He didn't recognize himself as guilty in the 22nd-century indictment.
One of Saipov's public fund-raisers, David Patton said they were "evidently disappointed" by the verdict of the prosecution.
"We believe that the execution of the death penalty instead of the sentence of a sentence of death without the acceptance of a sin," Patton said.
Saipovo's defence team had previously asked the prosecutors not to require a death penalty.
A security party messenger says that Brexit's negotiation responsibility should be placed on NYJEL FARZ
Today, Nigel Faraj vowed to "mobilize the army of people" during the Tori conference.
The former head of the UK's independence party said, "political actors must feel the warmth of the Europeans," because one of Teresa May's messengers suggested that she be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
A member of the common council representing the Conservative party, Peter Boone, told the passengers in Birmingham that the United Kingdom "would have come out," if Mr. Faraj had been the president of the Brexit line.
But Teresa May, the challenge of reconciling her strictly divided lines, has been highlighted more in the EU after joining the Tori side, Brexit.
Brexit's supporters and opponents, as well as the U.S. assault fund, the governor is trying to preserve the intermittent plan he's given the name Shanki.
The scholars claimed that he would continue his efforts to reach agreement with Brussels, despite the impact, thus forcing the Europeans and the Leborists to choose between the package he proposed and the causation.
Mr. Ben said, "To leave means to leave," at the protest he said he wanted to "reject the traffic."
He proposed that Mr. Faraj should become a partner and that he should be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we'd be out," he said.
The messenger who presented Wellingboro added, "I'm going to complete the Brexit, but we have to give up the chess."
Presenting his opposition to the EU, he said, "We didn't fight in world wars to be dependent.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bon rejected the assumption that the public opinion changed after the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their opinion and want to remain in the EU is absolutely wrong."
Andrea Jenins, who was on the side of Brexit, who was also on the road, said to reporters, "I'm just saying, Master, listen to the people.
"Sachmath" doesn't enjoy a great democracy, the resistance is not prepared to vote for it, it doesn't enjoy our partnership, as well as the activists who go out the street first and choose us.
Please, turn away from "Sachmath" and start listening."
In a strong announcement addressed to Mrs. May, she added, "Teachers keep their jobs if they keep their promises."
Mr. Faraj said that the political actors involved in the march should be forced to "feel warmth" if they stood at the end of the 2016 decision.
"Today this is a question of confidence between us, between people and politicians," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, 'We won't let you eat it.'
He added, "I want you to make our political class feel warm at the end of Brexit's betrayal.
We are mobilizing the army of people of this country who has dedicated us to our victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, the supporters of the U.S. were on the road through Birmingham, and they showed two hours in the city center.
Several activists were wearing Tori's badges against Brexit's last group this week.
Leborist Lady Adonis laughed at the conservators at the opening of the conference on security issues related to their party's cell addition.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have all TT technologies "Canada Plus Plus," he added.
"It's a complete fresco.
There's no good sense of Brex," he said.
Color plans to "consider carefully" the possibility of a presidential election
The U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections, he will be able to "be careful" in the presidential elections.
Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, a democracy representing Massachusetts in Western Massachusetts was talking about its future at a city hall gathering.
President Donald Tromp's permanent critic Varen has proposed his bid for a November election and will come against the representative of the public party Jeff Dill, who was the co-chairman of the 2016 Tromp's Massachusetts campaign.
Aeskosenes are turning, maybe, to the 2020 Challenge Net Troupe.
His 36th meeting, held on Saturday afternoon, with the voters in Holiok, was over from being President of the Tromp.
One of the participants asked whether he was going to propose a motion for the president's office.
Varen said it's time for women to go to Washington and restore the corrupt government, including the highest office.
The LSU's Simsus was arrested for murder.
On Saturday, the Baton Ruge police in the state of Louisiana announced that on Friday, LSU's basketball player Wade Sims was arrested for murder.
Baton Ruhe's police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Diton Simpson at 11 a.m.
They released the shooting video on Friday, asking for help to identify the man in the middle of the recording.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot and killed near the South University student district on Friday morning.
"Waved Sims has suffered head injury from a gunshot and has finally died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on a weekly basis through 247 sports.
Wade has arranged to protect his friend and get a condom from Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being present at the scene and armed and admitted to shooting Wade Simpson.
Simpson was arrested without interference and detained in the Paris Police Department of Eastern Baton Rugh.
Sims, who was raised in Baton Rugh, 6 feet (1.98 m) old, took part in a third course of 32 games, and the average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 singles, and 2.9 results in one game.
The Russian rosary: Louis Hamilton is approaching the world's championship court, when the team fight gives him victory over Sebastian Vetel.
Since Walter Botos went through Louis Hamilton on the Sabbath, it became clear that team fighting was going to play a major role in the race.
Botas started out well and almost blew up Hamilton, holding his position for the first two rounds and calling on Bethel to attack his team.
Vetel first appeared in a bad situation and allowed Hamilton to come out of the gang's pit -- something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes later came in and went out behind Bethel, but Hamilton walked by the foot of his eye, and the driver of the ferry was reluctant to step out of the inner road to protect him on the third corner after taking a double step.
Max Ferstampen started off a line following the network, and at the end of the first round was the seventh day of his 21st birthday.
Then he was the first in most of the race, and he wanted to get to the quick end and go over to Kim Reekconen to take the fourth place.
He finally reached the point in the 44th round, but couldn't speed up the remaining eight rounds, while Raxcon entered the fourth.
It's a tough day, because Walter worked fantasticly all the time and let me go as a gentleman.
"The team has done such an exceptional job, one in two," Hamilton said.
The Body’s Language Distorted
President Donald Trump has ridiculed Senator Daen Finnstein in a race when he claims that the letter of the Supreme Court's President, Christine Blaise, has not been circulated in sexual harassment to Brett Cavano.
During a speech in West Virginia, the president of the Senate's Legal Committee did not directly address the presentation given by Ford, rather than commenting on what was happening in the Senate, showing that people are "screaming and lying."
"One thing that could have happened, and the only wonderful thing that's happened in the Senate in the last two days, when you see anger, when you see angry people and the wicked and the screaming and the lying," he said.
"When you read Mamul's messages and popular information, they say, "Oh, I didn't do that.
I didn't do it."
Do You Recall?
Diane Finstein, did you spread the information?
Remember his answer... did you spread the document: "Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not spreading."
Okay, wait a minute.
Did we grow old... "No, we haven't spread," he added, like the senator?
In July, Finland was sent a letter of charges against Ford, Cavano, and earlier in September, it was distributed, but Finland denied that its office had distributed it.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't spread his story," Finland told the committee, as The Hill reports.
"He asked me to keep it secret and I did his request."
But his denial was not pleasing to the president, who commented on the race that took place last week, "I told you, the language of the body was very unsuccessful.
Maybe it didn't spread, but I've never seen a performance like that in body language."
By continuing to defend the High Court's case against three women, the president suggested that the democrats use these claims for their own purposes.
"They're willing to take power with all the necessary means.
You see evil and cruelty: they don't care who they're going to hurt, who they're going to go through, to gain power and control," the president said in a message from Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Duyer scored two goals against Dundee in the Giants team.
The Dundee Stars team scored after the Elite League team's victory on Friday, winning the 5-3 Saturday in the Dandi response.
The Giants were given an early advantage by the beatings of Patrick Douayer and Francis Bovilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Kawun evened the bill, and then Duyer restored the advantage of Giants.
And then the Lucas Lanwald Nilss' goals were a win for them.
It was Elite League's third season win for Adam Keefe's team, who took the lead and won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides -- the Giants team had won the previous three games.
The first shot of Douayer was 3:35 minutes from Kendal McFol's dog, David Rutherford gave the dog, and Boliviar doubled the score four minutes later.
In the first period, Sullivan changed the course of the game for the landowners at 13:10 and then, with the help of Matt Markudt, he evened out the account.
Thanks to the Duyers, the Giants brought the luck of the team, considering when he hit his second goal of the evening at the end of the first round.
The officers were reorganized, and Bushar re-balanced their account, mostly 27-37 minutes more.
Craun and Charles Corcoran joined in helping Nilsen to provide the Dundee team for the first time at the end of the second round, and he did everything he could to win the fifth round.
The Giant team, who have now won four of their five games, returned home, Milton Kanes, and are preparing for their next game on Friday.
Air traffic officer dies saving hundreds of aircraft passengers from an earthquake
In Indonesia, the air traffic officer has been a hero since he took all the steps to get hundreds of passengers to take a safe flight.
More than 800 people have died, and many are considered to have lost in the island of Sulaves as a result of a massive earthquake that caused a tsunami.
There's still a lot of strong research going on, and there's a lot of people left under the cracks in the city of Palu.
Twenty-year-old Antonio Gavana Agung refused to leave his guard at Mutiara Sys Al Jufre Airport, which was severely shaken, even though his colleagues were running away.
He stayed in his position and did everything he could to get the number of Batik Air Flight 6321 aircraft that was on the plane at that time to fly safely.
He then jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was breaking up.
Later he died in the hospital.
ABC News from Australia -- Indonesia's Air Navigation spokesperson Johannes Siret said it was possible that the decision saved hundreds of lives.
We've organized a letter from the Baliccap in Kalimantan to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning until the paperman reached Pala.
"Our heart softened when we learned about it," he added.
At the same time, authorities believe that the death rate could have reached thousands, and the country's disaster eradication agency says that the entry of the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Botong is limited.
"The number of dead may increase, because there are still many bodies under the plates, and some cannot be removed," said office spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The six-metre waves have destroyed Palu, where there's a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Thirty-five-year-old Rizza Kussama told Sky News, "A moment's haste brings bodies.
There's little clean water in it.
They've been robbed all over the place."
In Indonesia, the leader of the International Red Cross, Jan Gelfand, told CNN, "The International Red Cross is speeding up to help everyone else, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
This is a tragedy, but it can be worse."
On Sunday, Indonesia's President, Joco Vidodo, arrived at Palu and said to the country's armed forces, "I ask you all to work day and night to carry out any task that may arise.
Are you ready? says CNN.
This year an earthquake occurred earlier in the city of Lombok of Indonesia, killing 550 people.
Air Niugini says there's a missing person at the airport after the flight.
The airline operating the plane in the Pacific Ocean of Micronesia now says that one man has been lost, and earlier it said that all 47 passengers and personnel at the airport have been successfully displaced from the aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a report that there was a man's travel shortage in the middle of the week.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators, trying to find a man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the request to provide more details about the passenger (country or nationality).
And the ships of the country helped save the other passengers and the crew, after the plane had made an attempt to land at Trück Island Airport.
On Saturday, the authorities said that 7 people had moved to the hospital.
The airline said they were still in the hospital on the Sabbath, and they were all stable.
The cause of the emergency and the sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. military forces both say the plane has landed at the airport, not far from the airport.
Some stations think the plane came out of the plane.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was too low.
"It's a very good thing," Janes said.
Janes said that he and the others were able to get to the wreckage of the plane in the water up to the point.
He said the guards were screaming in the panic, and he had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Army said that ships repairing the ship in the vicinity also helped rescue work by bringing people to the shore with a lifeboat before the ship was about 30 meters (100 ft) below the water.
Air Safety Network data shows that in the last two decades, 111 people have died as a result of air raids by aircraft registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them belong to Air Niugini.
The Gospel writer presents the timing of the night of the woman’s murder
On Saturday, the court resumed the trial against a man who burned a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Analyst Paul Roulette of the U.S. Court of Justice, as a witness expert, has testified for hours in the field of research analysis.
He presented to the audience how he used cell phone records to bring a 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers' movements the night she was killed.
Roulette said that he had received information about being found from a few cells that showed that Telis was with him on the night of Chambers' death, which is contrary to his earlier claims, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was next to Chambers' phone when he said he was with his friend Michael Jennifer, the police went to speak to him.
For the Witnesses, Jennifer testified from the vane that it wasn't in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis was right to say that he had spent that night in the Jennifer truck, he said he was "a liar because my truck is in Nashville."
Another dissatisfaction is that Tellis said he knew him two weeks before Chambers died.
Cell phone records show they've known each other for a week.
Roulette said that shortly after the death of Chambers, Tellis had deleted his phone records, phone calls and contact data.
"He's taken her out of his life," he said.
The protection side should start presenting its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial on that day to be handed over to the jury.
The High Breed.
A hip-hop three wants to challenge the negative attitude towards this musical way by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed Group claims from Bristol that the hip hop has left behind its powers of political envoys and social problems.
They want to go back to her eyes and make her conscious hippie public again.
Artists like The Fugees and Commons have recently been reborn in the United Kingdom through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
New York's daughter gives the couple a sentence to get rid of work after a "racist" message
The New York branch gives the couple a divorce order to get rid of the discrimination after receiving a message from the wrong address saying that he is "one more black."
Husbands refuse to be racist, and the visit compares to "trading."
The mother of two children, Linsy Plasco-Flexman, expressed concern that the children's new play was black when she came into work the first day of 2016.
"WOWOWOVOOOK, AND MY SEVAMORT," Mrs. Plasco-Flexman wrote in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Morris twice.
After understanding his mistake, the "inconvenient" Plasco-Flexman released Morris from work, saying that their current African-American diet was bad and that he was waiting for the Philippines, says New York Post.
Mrs. Morris was paid for one day's work and sent home with Uber.
Now Maurice is giving the couple a divorce, asking for a paycheck to get rid of the job, and expects $350 to be paid for every six months for which they were hired, with the right to live in the workplace, even if they didn't sign a contract.
"I want to show them that you see, don't do that," he told Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The husbands responded to the charges of racism, saying that it was wise to get Morris out of work, because they were afraid that after he was offended, they would no longer be able to trust him.
"My wife sent him something that he didn't want to say.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist people," Joel Plascon said.
"But would you trust your children in someone you've been rude to, even if it was wrong?
Your newborn child.
Finish it."
Compared to "dramatic" the visit, Plasco said his wife had only had a baby two months ago and was "in a very difficult situation."
"And are you going to pursue someone like him?"
"It's not that good," the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still under way, the public opinion court has been quick to criticize husbands on social networks, condemning them for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington publishers were afraid that readers would not connect to a talking cell, which was revealed in a new letter.
Bondy's daughter Karen Yangkel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, says about the letter: "It's hard to imagine you instead of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It's very fun to know what we know today about Paddington's huge success."
When he said that his father, who was a BBC operator, had worked until he was inspired to write a book about a little rabbit, he added that the 60th year of publication of the book had had negative feelings after his death last year.
Speaking of Paddington, whom he considered to be "a key member of the family," he added that his father was quietly proud of his likely success.
"He was a very calm man, and not a proud person," he said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it's almost like having a child who's succeeded, you're proud of it, even though it's not what you did.
I think he was thinking of Paddington's success in some way.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he had the habit of presenting Paddington with dignity."
My daughter was dying, and I had to give up on the phone
Immediately after the surgery, his daughter moved to NIS Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors were ineffectively burying her life.
"Ned has been calling regularly to say that everything is really bad that he won't be able to overcome it," said Ms. Edna-Lapperuz.
"Then I received a call from Ned, saying, 'In a few minutes, I will deny him.'
And I gave it.
I said, "Tash, I love you very much when I love you.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors gave to keep her heart working were slowly losing her strength and getting out of her body.
He died some time before that, and that was the end of it all.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that this wouldn't be settled.
I couldn't shake, or be proud or cry, because I was surrounded by family members and people.
I really had to keep myself together."
Finally, Miss Edna Lapperous, who was still grieving the loss of her daughter, but she and the passengers flew up, forgetting the experience she was going through.
"No one knows," he said.
"I hung my head, and my tears were poured out all the time.
It's hard to explain, but when I was flying, I had an infinite sense of empathy for Ned.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
The poor women wrote an open letter to avoid suicide.
The two women who lost their loved ones as a result of suicide are working to keep people from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey wrote open letters at the Welsh gate, with encouraging calls and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Miss Davidis' son Taylor was 13 when he started suffering from depression and committed suicide at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I feel every day," he said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Lidney, said that his son was a promising cook with an infectious laugh.
And they knew him, and were all known unto him for their mocking.
They always said that his smile lit up the room."
However, he had left his job before he died because he was "a very dark place."
In 2014, Taylor's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his brother himself after his suicide.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm always afraid that this will have devastating consequences."
Ms. Davis has prepared the papers to "tell people that there are people you can meet and who you can talk to, even if they're friends.
Don't be silent. You need to speak."
Miss Humphrey, who has been Miss Davis' friend for many years, lost Mark, his 15-year-old partner, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was feeling bad or depressed or something," he said.
"A few days before Christmas, we saw a change in his behavior.
He was in the stern, awaiting the birth of the Holy One. When the children had opened their eyes, he didn't look at them, nor did he see them.
He said that his death was a great shock to them, but they had to overcome it, "It leaves a deep impression on the family.
It just destroys us.
But we all have to resist and fight."
If you fight to resist, you can call the Samaritans for free 116, 123 (Anglia and Ireland), or post jo@samaritans.org, or visit the Samaritan website here.
Brad Kevinah's condition depends on hair, because HDB starts research.
"I think if we could really find what he wanted, research had a limited time, a limited frame, we could get together," said Mr. Flake on the Sabbath, adding that he was afraid that the committee would be divided into military limitations.
Why does Mr. Kevinah and his government supporters want to investigate HDB?
Their dissatisfaction is only about time.
There's only five weeks left in the middle election, that's on November 6th, if the expected failure of the People's Republicans is significantly reduced in the highest court of the country.
George V. Bush took the phone to call the senators to lobby them to support Mr. Kevinah, who worked for White House and who met with his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the HDB report is presented?
There's going to be elections in the Senate where 51 percent are Republicans and 49 percent are Democrats.
It's not clear if Mr. Kevinah will be able to get 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice-President Mike Pence to achieve equality and establish himself in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's laws have been reduced in Kim's time.
The number of violations in North Korea has decreased, as Kim Jong Won came into power seven years ago, said North Korea's legislative body.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting information from the Northern United Ministry, said there were 1127 violations last year, compared to 2706.
Mr. Parque said that the tighter control of North Korea and China's borders and the high levels of tax havens were an important factor.
Pyongyang didn't make any public comments.
The vast majority of lawmakers from the north are finally receiving South Korea's citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally cut the border since the end of the 1953 Korean war.
Many are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and which is easier to cross than between two Koreans in a well-protected armed zone (DMZ).
China refers to refugees as illegal migrants, but not refugees, and often returns to their homeland with violence.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is still technically warlike, has improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries have met in Pyongyang to negotiate to halt the use of nuclear weapons.
This followed the historic meeting between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Won in Singapore in June, where they generally agreed to work towards a nuclear-weapon-free island in Korea.
But on the Sabbath, North Korea's Foreign Minister R.J. Hong accused the U.S. censorships of reducing their success since the day they were implemented.
"Without confidence in the U.S., we cannot trust our national security and in such circumstances, it is not possible to declare a unilateral military leader," said Mr. Rin New York at the U.S. General Assembly.
Nancy Pelosin Brad Kevinahin says she doesn't fit to work in the Supreme Court.
The mayor of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelos, proposed by the Supreme Court, called Brad Kevinahin, a " hysterical" and said that he did not fit in behavior to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelos made those comments in Austin, Texas, at the glory of the Texas Tribune, on the day of the interview.
"I couldn't help, but I think that if a woman does that, she's called hysterical," Felos told the Senate's judicial committee on Thursday about his response to the Kevin show.
Kevinahan emotionally rejected the charges that he had been sexually assaulted by Christine Blaise's Förde when they were both young.
In his opening speech, Kevin was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and screaming when he was talking about his family and school years.
He also clearly accused the committee's citizens of calling the accusations he had made in his address "suffering nonsense," organised by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
He told Pelos that he thinks Kevin's demonstration proves that he can't work in the Supreme Court, because it shows that he's against the citizens.
He said, "I think he's depriving himself of these demonstrations and his attitude toward Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Philos was tortured when he was asked if he would try to accuse Kevin if he was going to stand up, and if the demonstrators were the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say that if he doesn't tell Congress or HDB the truth, he doesn't just match the Supreme Court, but also the court where he is now," said Philos.
Kevin is now a judge in the Washington Court of Investigation.
He added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about the possible decisions of Kevinahan against the Law on Access to Health or the Rowe Wade Conflict, because he was considered a conservative justice.
In hearing about his establishment, Kevin avoided questions as to whether he would change the Supreme Court's clear decisions.
"Now is not the time for the hysterical and lateral man to go to court and expect us to say "what's great," he said.
And the woman has to own it.
It's just criticism, and the anger of months and years goes out, and he can't get rid of it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Miss Steinman said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's rare, do I?"
He continued, "The woman who was in charge helped me a lot, who said that she was crying, too, when she was angry, but she worked out a plan that assumed that when she was angry and started to cry, she said to the man she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad, because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then he just went on.
And I thought it was wonderful."
The tears are allowed to go away, in particular, because they're totally wrong.
One of my worst work memories in an office where men were dominated was when one day I was gripped by an indescribable anger when I was crying, a woman of my age, a cold manager, from whom I was always a little scared, grabbed my nose and pushed me to the stairs.
"Don't let them see you crying," he said to me.
"They don't know that you are angry.
They will think that you are sad, and will be glad that you have been afflicted."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked in the privileged section with Gary Hart.
In 1987, when he was arrested with a woman on a Monkey Business ship and charged with extramarital relations, she came from a contest, and the jury was disappointed, and Mrs. Schroeder thought there was no reason why she should not take a personal look at her favorite fight.
"It wasn't a well-balanced decision," she laughed at me 30 years later.
"There was already 7 participants in the anti-election struggle, and another one of them was the last thing they wanted.
Someone called it "The White Lion and the 7 Dwarves."
Since the campaign was a late one, he was behind on the fundraiser, and he swore not to enter the fight if he didn't raise $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
He discovered that his rights, which would give a man $1,100, would only give him $250.
"What, they think I'm going to get a hit," he wondered.
When he spoke, saying that an official campaign was not going to begin, he was so overwhelmed by emotions (thank you to the people who took care of him, the anger of the system that made it so difficult to raise money, and not to control the voters, the anger of sexual discrimination) that he was fooled.
"It was possible to think that I had a nervous disorder," said Mrs. Schroeder, recalling how the motherfucker reacted.
"You could think that Kleinex was my corporate guardian.
I remember thinking what would be written to my tombstone.
"He's been crying."
Like the U.S.-China trade war can be handy to China.
The first clashes between the U.S. and China on the trading scene were overwhelming, and the struggle between the two countries could benefit China in a long-term perspective, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump warned early this year of taxing the nuts from China, which include suntans, oranges, and aluminum.
The most significant escalation was this week when new sacks were put in place, affecting a total value of $200 million (£150 million) on the sheets -- in fact, half of the goods from the United States that came from China were imposed.
Five has given an equivalent answer every time, and in recent times, 5-10% has to be set at $60 billion on U.S. goods.
China has sworn to give an equivalent answer to the United States, and the world's second economy is hard to break.
Pushing Washington to stand up to the demands will happen, but public humiliation in front of the United States would be too embarrassing for China's President Si Zinpe.
However, experts claim that if Beijing is able to use its cards correctly, U.S. trade pressures can have a positive impact on China in the long term, reducing the linkage between the two economies.
"The fact that rapid political decisions in Washington and Beijing can create conditions for an economic closure in two countries is actually more dangerous than previously acknowledged by observers," said Abigail Regres, a researcher who is at the new Asian security analysis centre.
Syria ready to return refugees, says the developer
Syria says it's ready to return to refugee volunteers, and it's helping to rebuild a country that's been destroyed since the war of over seven years.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, developer Valid al-Mualem said the country's conditions are improving.
"Today, progress in combating terrorism has made the situation more stable and secure," he said.
To restore natural life, the government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists.
Today, there are all the conditions to ensure the return of refugees to the country that they left because of the economic sanctions of terrorism and loneliness that affected their daily lives and means of living.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million lovers fled the country after the war began in 2011.
Another 6 million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said that the love regime would welcome help to rebuild the ruined country.
But he said it wouldn't accept conditional help or help from the countries that advocated the rebellion.
Europe’s Victory at the Ryder Square in Paris
Europe's team won the Ryder Square in 2018, defeating the US team of 16.5-10.5 on behalf of the Le Golf National outside Paris.
The U.S. is now losing six times in an ongoing European field, and none of the Ryder's yard in Europe in 1993 has won.
Europe reselled the title after Danish senior Thomas Byron's team won the 14.5 unit needed to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Nickelson, who fought almost all the way through the race, sent the ball into the water after the 3rd hit, giving the game to Francisco Molinari during the 16th game.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all rounds, becoming one of the four players who have been able to win on a 5-0-0 score since 1979.
The American Jordan Spite 5 and 4 left the Danish Torbior Olesen out of the match, the most professional player on the European team.
The world's most prominent player, Dustin Johnson, turned over to English Polter for two and one, perhaps the last time he participated in Ryder's Bay.
The Spanish Veterans of the Eight Ryder Courts, Sergio Garcia, joined in the 25th unit, became Europe's greatest winners of all the times of the race.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't stop myself today.
It was a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing and trusting me.
I'm so happy that we've returned the tray.
The word is about the team, and I am happy that I was able to be useful," said Garcia, excitedly after the victory of the Europeans.
He's handing over the jajah to his native John Ram, who won the U.S. Golf Legend Tiger Woods on Sunday.
"I have a feeling of unimaginable pride after the defeat of Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching his game," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods gave all his 4 games to France, and now he's a 13-21-3 record.
It's an odd story for one of the most famous players who won the 14-star title, just to beat Jack Niklaus.
Besides Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level games throughout the competition, the entire U.S. team was suffering last week to find their way.
The U.S. senior Jim Furick, after a disappointing game for the team, said, "I'm proud of the boys, they fought."
One moment this morning we put pressure on Europeans.
We're broken.
I'll take my head out of front of Thomas.
He's a very tall man.
His 12 players were very good.
We'll reunite, I'll work with the American Association of Professional Golf Players and the Ryder Court Committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their oldest.
You have to be able to present yourself.
We're outnumbered.
