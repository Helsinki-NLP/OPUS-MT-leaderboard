Members of the National Assembly for Wales are afraid of confusion with the Muppets
For some members of the national assembly, the proposal is to change their title to "MWP" (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament).
There are plans to change the name of the National Assembly in Welsh Parliament.
National assembly members of all political directions are afraid to become the target of the ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party said that his group was concerned because the name “with “Twp” and “Pwp” refers to him”.
For non-valid readers: "twp" in Welsh for "doof" and "pwp" for "Aa".
A member of the National Assembly of the Plaid Cymru said that the whole group was "unhappy" and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was open to the name change, but pointed to the great similarity between "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter (w) is similar to the letter (u) in the English language spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission (National Assembly) which is currently drafting a law on name change said: "The final decision on the names of the national members of the assembly is of course with the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Board published the results of a public hearing on the proposals from which broad support for the name "Welsh Parliament" for the National Assembly was drawn up.
As regards the title of the National Assembly Members, the Welsh Parliament Members (Walisian Members) or WMPs preferred the option "MWP" in a public hearing.
The National Assembly members seem to propose alternative options, but the call for a consensus for President Elin Jones to present a draft legislation within weeks could be a problem.
The Reform Act will contain further changes to the work of the National Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of national members and on the establishment of the Committee system.
Members of the national assembly may vote in full on their name in their debate on the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change of national name
The voters decide on Sunday whether to change the name of their country to "Nordic Macedonia".
The referendum was set up to join a decade-long dispute with the neighbouring Greece, which has a province with a similar name for Macedonia.
Athens has long held that the name of its northern neighbour means that this claim is in Greek territory, and has repeatedly spoken against its accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would not accept the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, however, argue that the change in the price to be paid for accession to the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent in view of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
“The old people I spoke to said that in the past there was a bar and a church at every corner,” Adams said.
"Today there is no both."
He said that the disappearance of the bars would be reprehensible.
"People's social life looks different today," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living room of the neighborhood where people are regularly located."
In the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last long enough to be accepted by church leaders, and that they “will be at the beginning sooner or later”.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartments with property apartments in which people who do not support the remaining shelters.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy properties in these buildings will be white," he said, "and in order to speed up the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who enter these properties will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community emerged in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had given up its services in the vicinity became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or support blacks.
At a fire in 1939 the building was severely damaged, but when Father Johnson's community members planned the reconstruction, they commissioned the bell game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly referred to the bell game as "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the bell game in July used other words: "A cultural treasure" and "an indispensable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first bell game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who was changed to the largest bell game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he wasn't replaced by St. Martin's.
What has happened in the last few months in St. Martin's is a complicated story with architects and contractors who have been attracted to part of the lay leaders of the church and part of the diocese of the bishops.
In July, the Board of Commons – the board of directors of the municipality – expressed its written concerns about the diocese that the diocese would try to pass on the costs to the board, although it was not involved in the commission of the diocese-sponsored architects and contractors.
Some members of the community complained about lack of transparency on the sides of the diocese.
Hai injured in California 13-year-olds when diving to Lobstern
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the Lobster season, after official statements, a Hai attacked a 13-year-old boy while diving for Lobsters.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near the Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told the broadcaster KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been on Saturday morning for about half an hour with friends when he heard the boy's cry for help and with several others he walked to the boy to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought that the boy was glad to have caught a lion. But then he realized that the boy cried out: “I have been bitten!
I've been bitten!".
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he found that his whole key leg had been torn apart.
“I wrote that everyone should get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was fled to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego and is in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
The rescue swimmer Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks before. However, it was concluded that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body.
Officers blocked Ponto Beach's beach access to Casablanca to Swami's in Encinitas for investigation and security reasons for 48 hours.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to advance the cosmetic market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's attacks cosmetics departments that are encouraged to buy houses, which are occupied with specialized assistants, boats, Superdrugs and Debenhams.
As part of a major project on the UK's 2.8 billion-pound cosmetic market in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow, while fashion and household goods are declining, the larger cosmetic departments will be tested in eleven branches throughout the country. If they prove successful, they will be extended to other branches next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the search for the supermarkets for the possibility of using different charging areas used for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
According to Sainsbury's, the volume of its cosmetic offer is doubled for the first time to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also available series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees receive more space and brand areas similar to those in shops such as boats.
In addition, the supermarket conducts a relaunch of its makeup series "Boutique" so that most of the products are vegan-friendly – an aspect that is increasingly required by younger customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will be tested in two Sainsbury's branch sales outlets. The first sales outlet was opened last week in Croydon in southern London, and a second one will be opened in the course of this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the transition to the daily purchase of small amounts of food in local grocery stores means that supermarkets need to do more to get customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, sales outlets are increasingly looking like shopping houses as the supermarket chain tries to fight against discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has set up a series of habitat sales sites in hundreds of affiliates in Argos two years ago since the purchase of the chain of Argos and Habitat. This has increased the food rates and the profitability of the acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats in the early 2000s, but ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenues from the drug dealer's branches in the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury's sale of its 281 affiliates to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million UK pounds three years ago.
The company stated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan when an extended range of luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, are added to four branches.
Paul Mills-Hicks, purchase director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have redesigned the appearance image of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as advisers.
Our brand palette is tailored to all needs. Due to the tempting environment and the favourable locations, we are now an attractive target for cosmetics purchases that violates the previous type of purchase."
Peter Jones "fighting" after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from a business worth 11 million UK pounds
“Dragons”-Star Peter Jones is “fighting”, after TV moderator Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a business worth 11 million UK pounds with his lifestyle brand company to focus on their new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessories brand True.
The two were compared to Gwynet Paltrows Marke Goop.
The "This Morning" moderator, 37, announced her withdrawal to Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered "Dragons' Den" star Peter Jones by her extremely short-term withdrawal from her lucid lifestyle brand company to focus on their own new connection contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones was supposed to have been "rageful" as the "Golden Girl" of the television during an intense discussion on Tuesday in the centre of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, to be unable to devote enough time due to its new business – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – to the common homewear and accessories brand True.
The company was compared with Gwynet Paltrows brand Goop and would probably have doubled Willoughby's estimated assets of 11 million UK pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from True at Instagram, Jones left Britain on his way to one of his holiday destinations.
One source said: “Truly had the highest priority for Holly at a distance.
It should ensure their long-term future over the next decades.
Their decision to withdraw was totally surprising for all parties.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, as soon as the market started.
In the centre of Marlow, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the "This Morning" moderator, which is one of Britain's most promising stars, could cost the company, due to high investment in products from pillows and candles up to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in market introduction.
Moreover, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded True in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples spend the holiday together, and Jones holds a 40 percent share of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is intended to become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as moderator of the I'm A Celebrity ITV.
A source near Jones said last night: “We are not commenting on his business matters.”
Hard words "and then we fell in love"
He was joking at the criticism he would hear from the news media for a comment that some would view as "non-presidential" and for such positive statements about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said that the voice of a message moderator was as follows:
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, as the first meeting in Singapore in June of Trump was praised as a major step towards denuclearisation of North Korea.
However, the denuclearisation negotiations are on the ground.
Over three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the top North Korean diplomat, said on Saturday to leading politicians from all over the world on the occasion of the UN General Assembly that the North did not see the US' "reaction" to North Korea's first disarmament action.
Instead, he noted, the United States was committed to sanctions that should maintain pressure.
Trump proved significantly more optimistic in his public talk.
"We are very successful with North Korea," he said.
“We faced a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim showed positive results: the end of the rocket test, support for the release of hostages and the return of the deadly remnants of American military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of speaking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, there would be about 200 people here," Trump said, pointing directly at the number of people in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes destroyed an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of lives
After the earthquake of Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were said not to need them.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok's population was distributed, there was no national emergency, a prerequisite for the mobilization of international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not require international support, so this is something difficult," said Sumbing.
While Save the Children has a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work on-site.
Sutopo, spokesperson for the disaster protection authority, said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu whether international bodies should participate in the relief measures.
In view of the earthquakes with which Indonesia is constantly fighting, the country is still facing a tragically poorly prepared response to natural violence.
While Tsunami protection accommodation has been built in Aceh, these are not an everyday sight in other coastal areas.
Despite a warning that has come into force, apparently the lack of tsunami alerts in Palu has probably contributed to the deaths.
Travel between many islands of Indonesia is already an optimal challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will reach the site of the new disaster in three days at the earliest.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the proposed Indonesian infrastructure a core part of his campaign and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the government of the Joko seeking re-election next year suffers from financial deficits.
In addition, Joko is under pressure from persistent confessional tensions in Indonesia. Members of the Muslim majority there practice a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes and homes as bands of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
View: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge achieves deep compensation against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at the London Stamford Bridge Stadium with a hit in the 89th minute before a Premier League loss against Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at 0:1-back stand of his team in about 27 meters away from Chelsea gate.
He aimed the ball to the left and then shot it towards the back post.
The shooter sailed high across the penal area and drifted into the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arizabalaga and then into the net.
“I just tried to get in this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq always play as much as possible forward, so I just tried to make as much time as possible for myself,” Sturridge said to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I came to see edge and had a contact with the ball. I didn't think too much about it and just took the shot."
Chelsea, after a hit in the 25th minute, led by the Belgian Star Eden Hazard to half-time by 1:0.
The blues storm gave a pass with the ferret back to Mateo, then turned around the middle field and sprinted into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a fast double pass in the middle field.
Then he shot a good track pass, so that Hazard got into the courtroom.
Hazard left the defender behind and ended up with a left-hand shot at Liverpool's Alison Becker on the back of the net.
Liverpool plays at the group phase of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3:00 p.m. in the San Paolo Stadium in Naples.
Chelsea is facing the UEFA Europa League Videoton at 3:00 on Thursday in London.
The number of victims of Tsunami in Indonesia increases to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, as announced by the disaster protection authority on Sunday morning.
Many people are supposed to be trapped in the ruins of buildings, which were caused by the earthquake of strength 7.5 on Friday, which had triggered up to six meters of high waves, in a press conference, reported the official spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was translated into the ruins of a collapsed building.
Police arrest a man, 32, for suspicion of murder after a woman was kidnapped
After finding a female body in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was initiated this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 p.m. with stab wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested for murder.
The police call on the residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: “The investigation is in an early stage, but I ask all those who have stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I ask all persons, especially taxi drivers, who may have made contact with a Dashcam, to contact us. They may have information that is of major importance to our investigation."
A police spokesperson confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
Today afternoon friends who believe to know the woman are met at the theater to explore where she was found this morning.
The investigations are under way, and the police have told us that they are in the process of informing the next members of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get into his apartment, but was informed by the police that no one can enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
The residents are now informed that it will take hours to enter the building again.
It was heard a police officer told a man that the whole area is now being treated as a theater.
A woman appeared in tears dissolved at the place of the incident.
She repeats, "this is so terrible."
At 2:00 p.m., two police vehicles were found inside the lockdown and another vehicle was found before the lockdown.
Within the lockdown, several police officers were watching the dwelling block.
People with information will be asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC to call 101 or to refer anonymously to Crimestoppers under number 0800 555 111 and refer to protocol entry 247 of 30 September.
The Cromwell statue before Parliament will be the newest monument to the dispute over the rewriting of history
Her connection would be poetic justice for her destruction of so many cultural and religious art products from England by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as "tolerance" and "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate about the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s stand before the Palace of Westminster became the goal.
The picture storm in the English Civil War was neither arranged nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the deeds of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's beautiful depiction of Cromwell is evidence of the opinion and part of the historical writing of a figure that, according to many, is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is defended by many, perhaps by the end of the 19th century more than today, than by someone who viewed Parliament against pressure from outside, in his case of course by the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully relevant presentation is the subject of further debate.
It is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure that represents a side of this gap.
His performance as a Lord's Protector is also worth celebrating and remembering."
Killer pig bites Chinese farmer dead
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China.
The man to whom only the surname "Yuan" was called was detected with a broken artery bloodstreamed near a pighouse on the market in Lipuanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, prepared to inject pig vaccines.
He was told on Wednesday with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and saw that a door was open to a nearby pighouse.
He said that in the stable there was a large male pig with blood on his neck.
According to the report, a forensic study confirmed that the 250 kilos of heavy pigs had devoured the farmers.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and confused," was quoted by Guiyang Evening News, the cousin to whom the last name was called "Who".
Recordings of a security camera showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been detained to prevent attacks on other people while the police collected evidence at the tatort.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are negotiating reports of compensation for his death.
Although it is rare that pigs attack people, such cases are known.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on her farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290-kilometer heavy-duty pig caught a Welsh farmer between himself and a tractor until the farmer's wife was able to swallow the animal.
After a farmer was fed by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “dissolver”.
"They're just crazy.
They are happy and very curious, ... they are not about hurting anyone.
You just have to treat them with the right measure of respect," he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread heavy rains to the southwest of the USA
As forecasted, Hurrikan Rosa weakens on the way across the colder water on the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring floods that cause floods in North Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
On Sunday at 5:00 o'clock east coast time Rosa showed wind speeds of 136 km/h, which corresponds to a Hurricane of Category 1, and was 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, the Pacific begins to form a trolley that moves east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa reaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, high tropical humidity is carried to the north in the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will be triggered on Monday in parts of Mexico up to 25 centimeters of precipitation.
Then, in the coming days, tropical humidity is produced by interactions with the associated drought, which is widespread in the south-west.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation can cause dangerous fluctuating floods, water-driving shields and possibly earthworms in the desert.
High tropical humidity leads to precipitation rates of almost 5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation is expected.
Due to the fluctuation of the tropical rainfall, there is the possibility of fluctuating floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
In view of the threatening tropical defeats, it is imperative to walk into the desert.
Strong precipitation can cause canyons to become tiring streams, and thunders bring local winds as well as the wind that leads the dust with it.
The nearby Trough brings locally strong rains in parts of the coast of southern California.
It is possible to have total impact amounts of more than one centimeter which can lead to a low level of water-driving protection and smooth roads.
This would be the first impact of the rainy season in this region.
The first individual tropical rainshows reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning. On Monday evening and Tuesday it spreads.
On Tuesday, strong rains spread into the Four-Corners region and last Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States, as the Arctic cools while the troops remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday there is a good example of drastic temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC.
In the coming days, the constant heat of summer is trying to develop and expand again.
For a large part of the middle and east of the USA, a warm beginning of October with wide-spread temperatures is expected at 27 oC from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a high probability of over average temperatures in the first half of October in the east of the United States.
Over 20 million spectators have seen Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
Over 20 million viewers saw on Thursday six television networks the arresting statements of Brett Kavanaugh and the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political situation was halted. On Friday, TV broadcasters interrupted their regular program for a last-minute turnover: a deal negotiated by Jeff Flake, Senator from Arizona, and the FBI is to conduct a weekly investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate's Judicial Committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, had trouble and tried to remove their clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure this was not happening.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million observers reported by Nielsen have seen the hearing.
The company identified the average viewing numbers for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network that had broadcast the hearing, the numbers were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems measuring audiences in offices.
To get this into the right perspective: This corresponds to the number of spectators in a play-off football game or Oscar rental.
The broadcaster Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented moderators strongly support Kavanaugh's nomination, reported that Nielsen had an average of 5.69 million viewers of all-day hearings the highest numbers of all networks.
ABC came with 3.26 million spectators in second place.
CBS reported that Nielsen had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the drama from Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican had issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was filmed on Friday morning by CNN and CBS, as protestors on the way to a hearing of the Justice Committee held loud with words.
He stood for minutes with a lowered view while he was trained. The scene was transmitted live at CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
"They have power while so many women are powerless," said one woman.
Flake said that his office had published a statement and added that before the driver's seat concluded that he would have more to say at the hearing before the committee.
All cable and radio networks sent hours later live than the Justice Committee should vote on the continuation of the appointment of Kavanaughs to vote in favour of the entire Senate.
Flake said, however, that he would do this only on condition that the FBI, like the democratic minority, investigates the charges against the candidates next week.
Flake was partly convinced by interviews with a friend, democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After an interview with Coons and then several senators Flake made his decision.
Flakes' decision was of great importance, since it was obvious that the Republicans would not have sufficient votes to confirm Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has initiated an FBI investigation of the charges brought against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of using Brexit for political purposes
Prime Minister Theresa May accused Sunday Times critics of her plans to leave the European Union, use the future of Britain for political purposes, and undermine the interests of the nation in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May meets on September 29, 2018 at the Conservative Party in Birmingham.
In addition to the interview with her on the title page of the paper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stepped up her attack on her so-called "Checkers Plan" for Brexit by proposing a proposal that provides for the mutual entry of customs by Britain and the EU as "full absurdity".
Killed shootings on Wayde Sims: Police record suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect in connection with the deadly shootings at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested according to Baton Rouge police.
The Authority published video recordings of the dispute between Sims and Simpson. According to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As the CBS partner station WAFB reported, the police secured the glasses at the scene and said that Simpson's DNA had been found at the glasses.
After an interview with Simpsons, the police reported that he had been standing on the street with the deadly gunshots.
The lawyer reports that the bond has been set to $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office published a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound on the neck.
The police are grateful to the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the federal police, the Southern University Police, and the people in the area for their support in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the regional enforcement authority for "their care and their pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1,98 m big bird player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for the LSU basketball.
In the last season he achieved an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, the basketball coach of LSU, Will Wade, said that the team was "deeply shocked" and "socked".
"That's what you're always afraid of," Wade said.
Volcano hit ash on Mexico City.
From the Volcano Popocatepetl ash has reached the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after increased activity in the crater and within 24 hours 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of gangs and riots.
Pictures in social media showed thin ash layers on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists reported that since an earthquake of 7.1 Central Mexico in September 2017, there has been an increase in activity at 72 kilometres south-east of the capital.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Meetings between the police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday following a clash between the readiness police and pro-independence demonstrators. Thousands took part in other demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the polarising independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists who were detained by the readiness police threw them with eggs and also sprayed colour powder, causing dark dust clouds to arise in the streets normally populated by tourists.
In the course of the day, there were also handcuffs with the police who used their beatings to slow down the fight.
For several hours, scanned pro-independence groups “Don’t forget, don’t forgive”, while they faced Unionists who called “long live Spain”.
As the local press reported, fourteen people were treated for smaller injuries in protests.
One year after the referendum of 1 October, which was seen as illegal by Madrid, however, by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region is still very tense.
The voters had decided with an overwhelming majority for independence, although the vote was low, as the split-off opponents had most boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent the vote in violent clashes before the polls.
Pro independence groups had camped in the open on Friday night to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but he was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part with his wife in the separatists' protest, said he saw the prospects that Catalonia would achieve independence, no longer with hope.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could choose, but now we hang," he said.
Despite an important, although few, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties this year had difficulties maintaining the momentum. Many of their most famous leaders are either in exile or in prison, where they await their procedures because of their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the police protest on his phone, said the conflict had been cut off by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is always getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in the poll since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for election to the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for the European elections, it is the best option to push down democratic values and oppression by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after being taken from the car
Three men at the age of 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after being taken by a car in Londonderry several times.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the tower and the building themselves were damaged.
In addition, it may have been fired with a chest of arms on the car.
Menga hit for Livingston 1:0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Mengas' first gate for Livingston won the victory.
The uplifted Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Association.
Dolly Mengas meeting proved crucial for Gary Holt's team in the second half of the year to be equal to Hibernian.
Gerrard's team remains in this season with no external victory in the Premiership and faces the hearts that lie behind eight points on the next Sunday.
The rangers were previously host to Rapid Vienna on Thursday at the Europa League.
In the meantime, Livingstone can increase its victory series in the division to six games, which means that the Chief Trainer Holt has not yet been down yet since his takeover of Kenny Miller in the last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against leisurely playing guests
Holts team would have had to be in charge long before the hit, since its direction presented the Rangers with the most diverse problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but he slowed down before the door. Then Alan Lithgow could only shoot far after he had entered to meet Craig Halkett's headshot at the door.
The hosts were pleased to let the rangers play before themselves, knowing that they could prevent the guests in standard situations.
In this way, the crucial door came to rest.
The Rangers left a free play, and Livingston prepared a chance to bring Declan Gallagher and Robinson Menga together into a shooting position. This shot the door with a ball contact from the center of the crime scene.
In this phase, the Rangers had dominated the ball ownership, but could not overcome the host's defense, and the tortoise Liam Kelly remained largely uninhabited.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos Kelly once forced him to defend himself.
Scott Pittman was rejected by Allan McGregor's Rangers, and Lithgow jumped the ball from another standard situation of Livingston.
Flanken has been able to go back to Livingston's prison and has been brought out of danger on a regular basis, while two required fines – one by Halkett against the intertwined Glenn Middleton and one because of a hand game – have been refused.
Livingston’s Phenomenal – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont by BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were outstandingly excellent and had again exceeded the expectations of this upward trend.
Their playful manners and their team have hardly changed since their return to the top teams, but Holt pays a great tribute to the way in which he has groomed the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led to an excellent organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall were on fire during the whole game.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As well as they were under Gerard in time, they could not achieve this standard.
Their last ball was insufficient – only once they could penetrate the host team – and this is something like a wake-up call for the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Get Erdogan with mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), smiling faces and blue sky ruled when the heads of government of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to repair relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes about issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and the accession of Turkey to the EU.
Then Erdogan traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called security reasons for refusing to gather in front of the mosque a strong number of 25,000 people. However, many supporters were nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurds – also got heard. They condemned Erdogan's politics as well as the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The opposite protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, which is praised by some German Turks as a hero and is embellished by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Bike drivers die in a car crash
At a collision with a car, a biker died in London.
The crash took place around 10:15 a.m. British summer time near the crossing of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and health care took care of the man who died in the accident.
Months before the accident, another biker was killed in an accident with a driver's escape at the Children Street, about 1.6 km from the accident on Saturday.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials were working to identify the man and inform his next of kin.
Roadblocks and lines for buses are set up, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin prison: Six officers injured in unrest
According to the Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in an insurrection in a high-security prison for men.
The disturbances broke out on Sunday at about 9:30 a.m. British summer time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and still persist.
Specialized "Tornado" officers were added to end the disturbances involving eight insatiables and restricted to a wing.
Officials were treated locally for minor injuries in the face.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service said: “In particular, trained prison personnel were used to repair an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and want to make it clear that the police are being handed over and perhaps spent more time behind bars."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was treated by a prisoner in the hospital after an attack.
In October last year, police officers were sent to prison to deal with serious disturbances in which the staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurrikan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with fluctuating floods (survivor areas may benefit)
It is rare that tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the remains of Hurricane Rosa move across the southwest marked by deserts and bring the risk of fluctuating floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings against fluctuating floods on Monday and Tuesday from West Arizona to the south and east of Nevada as well as to the south-east of California and Utah including the cities Phoenix, flagship, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa is approaching with rain on Monday evening and on Tuesday she is going straight across Phoenix.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported in a tweet that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have approached Phoenix as a tropical storm or tropical depression up to 320 kilometers!
Katrina (1967) was a Hurricane within 64 kilometres of the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation with a single impact of up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest, including the central rockies and the Great Basin, it is likely that 2.5 to 5 centimeters and a total of up to 10 centimeters are possible.
For those who do not have the risk of fluctuating fluctuations, the rainfall associated with Rosa can be a blessing because of the drought in the region.
Although floods are of great concern, these rains are likely to be useful in part because droughts are currently taking place in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, there are at least 40 percent of Arizona's extreme droughts, the second highest category", weather.com reported.
First, the path of the Hurricane means that Rosa will meet on land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning Rosa will still have Hurricane strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour and are 620 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. Then the Hurricane will be drawn to the north with 19 kilometres per hour.
In the Pacific the storm will hit colder water and thereby weaken.
Therefore, Rosa is expected to hit land on Monday afternoon or -night in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm.
The rainfall can be severe in parts of Mexico so that there is a significant flood risk.
"From Baja California to the north-west of the Sonora deserts, rainfall is expected from 7.5 to 15 centimeters, with up to 25 centimeters possible," weather.com reported.
Then Rosa will move as a tropical storm in the north over Mexico, on the early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression reach the Arizona border, and then to the late afternoon through Arizona to the south of Utah.
"As a major threat to Rosa or her remains, very strong defeats are expected in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora Desert and the southwest of the US marked by the desert," the National Hurricane Center reported.
As a result of these impacts, life-threatening fluctuations in the desert and in water-driving protection as well as in mountainous areas are expected to occur.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
After finding a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset, three boys were arrested in their teens and a 20-year-old man under suspicion of the attempted murder.
The teenager was injured on Saturday at 4:00 p.m. in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital and his condition is "stable".
According to Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
The officials asked all those who had records of the events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had been "under the community, the anger" of the Democrats.
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the incessant and unheard of tactics of the Democrats," Trump said in a broadcast in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Mr Trump said that during the entire nomination process, Kavanaugh had suffered "under the community, the anger" of the Democrats.
On Thursday before the Congress, Kavanaugh said that he was sexually harassed by Christine Blasey Ford, who was both teenagers decades ago.
Ford also stated in the hearing that she was indicted.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw on this day the brilliance, the quality and the courage of Kavanaugh.
"A vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal heads of our time, a lawyer with an excellent balance in the service of the general public," he said to the number of his followers in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important choices in our life.
I'm not going in, but I'm actually going in," he said.
"That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats saw their mission as "to resist and block".
The first important procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place in the Senate no later than Friday, a high-ranking member of the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes in Indonesia, rising numbers of victims
According to the authorities of Saturday, at least 384 people were killed. Many of them were killed because of a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival on Friday at the beach of Palu when up to six meters of high waves struck the beach when darkness broke and many people died and destroyed everything that was on their way.
The tsunami was preceded by an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude.
"When the threat came through the tsunami yesterday, people were still going to the beach and didn't get away with it, and they fell victim to it," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian disaster protection authority GNPB at a conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it was swimming cars, trees and houses with it, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said. He added that the tsunami had moved 800 km/h across the open sea before reaching the coast.
Some people were climbing on trees on the escape from the tsunami and had survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated and placed in 24 centers in Palu.
Many damaged buildings and shops, curved and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water, were reported by the disaster protection authority.
On Saturday, the coastal town was shocked by other neighbors.
The Earthquake series was to be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Authority BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) stated in a statement that the massive energy released from the mass bombing on Friday corresponded to the 200-stakeholder of the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have grown larger, the authorities said.
Nugroho described the damage as "comprehensive" and stated that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, the bodies of some victims were found among the ruins of collapsed buildings. 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damage along the coast could have been higher 300 km north of Palu, in an area named Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the plague.
The communication with Dongala was completely blocked according to the words of Nugrohos, and there was no information.
According to a Red Cross statement, more than 300,000 people live there, and his employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse," said the statement.
On Saturday, the Authority was repeatedly criticised for not being informed that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the waves had occurred according to official data at the time of the warning.
Amateur recordings published in social media show a man on the top floor of a building who no doubt calls the people on the street below him in front of the nearby tsunami.
Within minutes a wall of water will be on the shore and will be swimming in buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
Through the bombing and tsunami, there was a massive power failure that disrupted the communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue measures.
According to the authorities, the military has begun to send cargo aircraft with the support of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still need urgent food and other vital goods.
The airport of the city remains closed until October and has only been reopened for aid measures.
For Sunday a visit by President Joko Widodo was planned in evacuation centres in Palu.
The number of tsunami victims has increased to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
The World Vision staff from Dongala have reached the city of Palu, where the staff are housed in tent shelters in the inner courtyard of their office, but after the words of Dosebas, they passed through scenes of desertification.
"They told me they had seen many destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even when the relief groups began with the hard task of putting disaster relief in motion, some experts pointed out that foreign aid would be prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial assistance, supplies and personnel from abroad are only possible once the location of an accident has been declared national disaster area.
That's not happening until now.
"It is still a disaster at provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'okay, this is a national disaster', we can accept international support.
While the second night since the earthquake and tsunami fell from Friday over Palu, friends and family members of the still missing hoped for these on one of the wonders that shed some light on the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was dragged out of a sewage canal.
On Sunday, rescue forces release a woman who was trapped under a drummer for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, the trainer of the Indonesian Paragliding National Team, had trained two of the missing paraglidings for the beginning of this month in Indonesia to finish the Asian games.
Other prisoners at Roa-Roa-Hotel were prisoners, as Mandagi added, his students.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear," he said.
Gendon told how in hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa-Roa Hotel under the paragliders made the round, WhatsApp had sent news to the contestants from Palu who participated in the beach party.
However, his messages led only to gray questions instead of blue hooks.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Stealing 26.750 US dollars while filling a cash machine in Newport on the Levee
According to a press release by the Newport police, on Friday morning in Newport on the Levee, a staff member of Brink’s was stolen from Newport to fill in a cash machine of $26,750.
The driver of the vehicle had learned a cash machine in the entertainment complex and wanted more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, "a man came running behind the employee of Brink's" and stole a bag of money that was intended for the machines.
According to the press release, several suspects fled the scene. However, the police did not indicate how many people were involved in the incident.
Persons who have information on the identity of the suspects are asked to contact the NYPD under 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes its name – in Ye.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formally knows as Kanye West" (the officially known as Kanye West).
West, 41, has been the top name Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eight albums published in June.
The change precedes his performance at Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album "Yandhi" is expected.
He acts in the broadcast as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, has given up for "emotional reasons".
The word is not only abbreviation of its current professional name, but it has, according to its own statement, a religious significance for the West.
“I believe “yes” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “du”, said West this year in a conversation about his album with Radiomoderator Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
From Kanye, what “the only” means, only “Ye” – simply a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of all things.
The album rather reflects what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs was known under the names Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who had previously worked with the West, has also written his name with and without strings and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use the military against the civilian population
The elected Mexican President, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, vowed never to use military violence against the civilian population, while the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression against students in his country was approaching.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use the military to suppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers had set fire to a peaceful demonstration in the square and killed 300 people. At that time, left-wing student movements were establishing themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans through monthly support for students and the opening of other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training provided young criminal gangs.
USA should double financial resources for artificial intelligence
In view of China's increased activities in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research expenditure in this field, says Investor and KI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow KI announcements from various areas of U.S. government, even if the US generally lacks a formal KI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: the country intends to become number 1 in the field of KI innovation by 2030.
"The duplication of the KI research budget would be a good start in view of the fact that all the other countries are so far behind the United States, we are looking for the next KI breakthrough," Lee said.
The duplication of financial resources could double the chances that the next major success in the US would be achieved, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent KI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at the Carnegie Mellon University on a KI system that beat the highest-ranking American Othello players. Later he was the leader of Microsoft Research and President of the Google branch in China.
Lee praised earlier U.S. government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and asked for the date of the next competition, as he wanted to help identify the next visionary.
According to read, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain state subsidies.
"Not China takes away the academic top forces, but the companies," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have set up Korypheen from universities to work on KI.
According to Lee, a modified US immigration policy could also be supportive of the US's KIC efforts.
"I think that Greencards should be offered automatically in the area of KI-Promoted persons," he said.
In July 2017, China's Council presented its plan for the development of the next generation of KI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Lees, the National Natural Science Foundation of China funds people in academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence set up the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, to be involved in the partner of industry and science. The White House also announced the formation of a special committee for artificial intelligence.
DARPA also announced this month the investment of 2 billion US dollars in the "AI Next" initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than 100 million dollars annually in KI research.
In the meantime, US legislation has not done anything about the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on a change of national name
The population of Macedonia agreed on Sunday in a referendum on whether the country's name should be changed to "Nordic Republic of Macedonia", a decade-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's applications for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour means that it raises this claim in the Greek territory. Therefore, Greece has submitted a veto against Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments concluded an agreement on the basis of the proposed new name. Nationalist opponents argue, however, that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Macedonian majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum. A boycott campaign raises doubts that the voter will reach 50 per cent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the voting list was: "Are you for membership in NATO and the EU through the adoption of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, to which Prime Minister Zoran Zaev belongs, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth the price of admission to organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the European Union, because this means a safer life for us all," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, many Members have said that they would stick to the result so that it is crucial.
The amendment would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, voting was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66 per cent of the registered voters had given their vote.
"I am here for my children to vote, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko gave their vote in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018 in the referendum on the change of the country name, which Macedonia would open the way for NATO and the European Union.
Before the Skopje Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and presented chairs to tents that were set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the elevated capital, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of integration between Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will result in more than 20 per cent of Macedonia's unemployment rate, resulting in urgently needed investments.
"I believe that there will be a large majority for this, as there are more than 80 percent of our citizens for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
According to him, a 'yes' result would be 'confirming our future'.
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV found that 57 percent of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70 percent said they would vote with 'yes'.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the vote must be at 50 per cent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first severe blow to the policy of the provincial government since its adoption in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero by Manchester City manipulated by the entire Brighton defense to reach the gate
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling passed the Brighton defense on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester at the 2nd victory of Manchester City.
Aguero made his hit in the 65th minute look ridiculous.
The Argentine attacker received a pass in the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenders and then ran into the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He played around a defender and then took over several other defenders on the edge of Brighton's punishment.
Then he shot a pass to the left of Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the prison to play the ball back to Aguero, who crossed his right shoe Brighton-Torhüter Mathew Ryan and shot into the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with problems in his feet," City-Manager Pep Guardiola said to reporters.
"We had talked about that he should play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he had reached a door at this point."
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League Duell.
This gate fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero won the ball at this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good track along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed some trains to drive Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky Blues attacker targeted the ball into the net just before he went out.
City plays in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim vs. Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to ruin the Rockies game
Since the nationals are excluded from the playoff competition, there was little reason to force another action.
However, the always powerful joke hopes to stand on the hill on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if this is relevant for the Rockies that have a game of lead in the NL West before the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Rockies won at least one wild card with a 5:2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Even if we don’t play anything, we can at least throw away because we know the atmosphere among the viewers here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that would meet me this year.
Why should I not participate in this competition?"
The Nationals have not announced a starter for Sunday, but they tend to get jokes thrown in such a situation according to reports.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th use as a starting player, practiced in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on Sunday on his normal rest day.
The Washington right-hand has this season a statistics of 18-7, an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump is broadcasting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation in connection with the Brett Kavanaugh elected by him to the Supreme Court when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the elections.
“Everything we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important choices in our life.
That's one of the big, big – I don't get into it, but actually I get into it, so I fight everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats, you see it happening now.
And they are determined to take power again with all means, you see the community, the abhorrence.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they have to overcome in order to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give them."
The Democrats, he said, see their mission as "resistance and blocking".
"And you see that in the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "disgusting and common and hateful and dishonest".
He specifically called the highest-ranking democrat in the Senate's Justice Committee, Senator Diana Feinstein, which triggered a riot in the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document outside?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, no, I'm waiting for you – that was a really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer subject to all opinions.
The party is intolerant to those who say their opinion.
When the moment activists in my local party agreed to beat me, this came as little surprise.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour MEPs who are said not to be welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly, as she had risen vigorously against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized with the tabling request for representing a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, or ironically on similar issues, on which Jeremy with former top politicians was not an opinion.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that "the meetings should all be inclusive and productive".
Most of the voluntary GC meetings in my eight years as a local Labour Member were exactly that.
Unfortunately, most of the meetings today are not marked by this tone, and the promised 'friendly, more considerate' policy has been forgotten for a long time since it began at all.
It is becoming increasingly clear that divergent views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and that any opinion is then judged whether it is accepted by the party summit.
This began shortly after Jeremy became party leader. Members with whom I previously believed to share similar political views, now expected me to turn around and take positions with which I would never otherwise have agreed – whether with regard to national security or the European internal market.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn’t matter what I say – there’s a chimpanzee in the social media that calls for my election, which pushes the political center and says that I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience, I'm not alone.
In fact, I know that I am doing better than some of my colleagues because the comments I have addressed are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face daily a flood of sexist or racist abuses and yet never behave lightly.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that insults have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corby asked the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we will no longer be able to apply all opinions, and with every suspicious request and any change in the electoral rules, the party will become more narrower.
In the last two years, I have often been asked to raise my head and not to express my opinion so clearly, and then I would have no problem.
But I didn't go into politics.
Since 32 years ago, as a student, I have been caused by the neglect of thatcher government, because of which my classroom in the whole school has literally joined the Labour Party, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most – as a community as well as as a cabinet minister.
I have never made a cure from my political point of view, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way be unclear about my political positions and about areas in which I do not agree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to the supporters of the Friday application that, in view of the fact that the country is going to be hit by a brexit, the households, businesses and our public service will be damaged, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But in fact, I did not send this message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my electors, whether they are Labour Members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that I will not be left with so many threats of election or political thought, in my opinion, to act in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr against Melrose 38:17: Unbeatable Ayr team rises at the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the outcome something, but there is no doubt that Air has earned the victory in this extremely entertaining game of the day in the Tenent's Premiership.
You are now the only ten teams unbeatable at the top of the table.
Finally, the success of the home team was due to its superior defence as well as to its better exploitation of opportunities, and Coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in our games so far, and we are still unbeatable, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie von Melrose said: “Recognition for Ayr, they have earned their chances better than we have.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was increased by Frazier Climo, led by Ayr. However, Melrose was able to make the figures speak due to a yellow card for the Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who had been released for the game by the Warriors, and Jason Baggot started a non-increased attempt.
Climo expanded Air's leadership with a fine before he achieved a hit at halftime and then an increased attempt at the entrance, so it was for Air's break 17:5.
Melrose, however, started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Afterwards, there was a longer interruption due to a serious injury by Ruarid Knott, which was borne by the field. After the continuation, Ayr developed his lead through an attempt by Stafford McDowall by Climo.
Then, as captain of Air, Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and again Melrose paid the additional man at the end of a huge pressure phase by a non-increased attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling without ball against Climo, MacPherson obtained from the criminal gas from a touchdown behind the exciting air package.
Climo has increased almost since the interruption, after Kyle Rowe David Armstrong's Boxkick was arrested and Flanchenplayer Gregor Henry released for the fifth attempt by the home team.
"Silly Game" star seems ready for a new career in gastronomy
"Silly Game" Star Ford Kieran seems to be ready for a change in the hospitality after it turned out to be the manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC broadcast, whose spinbooks he writes and in which he plays one of the main roles together with his long-standing comedy partner Greg Hemphil.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth staff will be the last of the mission, and Kiernan seems to be planning a life for Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the manager of Arifingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of Scottish Sun indicated Kiernan's interest in entering Glasgow's "floating restaurant business".
"The sea belongs to us": Bolivia, which is included by country, hopes that a court will open its way to peace
Matrosen patrol in front of the marine headquarters decorated with diving in La Paz.
In public buildings there is a more blue flag.
Fleet support points from the Titicacasee to the Amazon bear the motto: “The sea is our legal property.
It is a duty to win back."
In all parts of Bolivia, the memory of the coastal section lost to Chile in a bloody conflict in the 19th century is as vivid as the desire to go back to the Pacific.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades, as Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice, which will be held on 1 October after five years of consultations.
"Bolivia has the inclination, a spirit of unity and confidence, and expects the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the IGH's judgment on large screens in the hope that the Court in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia's claim. According to this, Chile is obliged after decades of sporadic talks to negotiate a sovereign access to Bolivia's sea.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who next year faces a controversial struggle for his re-election, there is also a lot at stake in the judgment on Monday.
"We are just about to return to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the Court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and believe that this would make little difference.
The UN body based in the Netherlands is not empowered to speak to Chilean territory and has stated that it will not decide on the outcome of possible discussions.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, the IGH's verdict has been presented six months after the final spleen.
Far from supporting the Bolivian case, the last four years could also mean a backlog.
"The current Bolivian government has raised the question of access to the sea," Zárate said.
She pointed out that morale's war rhetoric has stifled any remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some point, but after these events this will be extremely difficult.
Since 1962, the two countries have not been able to exchange ambassadors.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, recalled the view that the court's decision was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia has “an exceptional opportunity to launch a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end the 139 years of disputes for mutual benefit”, he said.
Calzadilla also argues that morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – use the subject of the sea as a political bridge.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will only take place if it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never first cease its nuclear weapons if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit between the Heads of State of the rivals in Singapore.
His statements come at a time when US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo appears to be shortly before the summit of the North Korean Heads of State, Kim Jong-un, in Singapore, more than three months after the end of the summit.
Ri suggested that further sanctions and US resistance against a declaration to the end of the Korean war would ever force the North into the knee as a "scarf."
Washington is skeptical and does not want to accept the declaration without first taking major disarmament steps.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pjöngang is serious about giving up an arsenal in which the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans for next month a visit to Pyongyang to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris show the latest collections for huge head coverings that will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your skin collection or completely shield the sun, you no longer need to search.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a range of crazy oversized head coverings for their 2019 summer collection that fascinated the fashion world at the Paris fashion week.
Extremely unpractice huts have crossed Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their watching creations over the walkway.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an extravagance beige-coloured hat with a federated wide edge that just pressed the heads of the models.
As other over-dimensional accessories, watermelons filled with jewels, a magic hat and even an pineapple were displayed. However, they are not meant to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a number of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were equipped with raised lips and had more similarities with Hannibal Lecter than with leather couture.
One creation resembled a diving equipment, including snorkel and divers, while another looked like a melted iceberg.
And if you want to make another huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Fashion watchers predict that the huge head coverings could find their way in shopping streets near you.
The over-dimensional huts follow directly to La Bomba, the 60-centimeter-wide straw hut, which all carry from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely unpractice hat, which struck large waves in the social media, sent another great creation over the walkway: a beach bag made of straw, which was almost as big as the one wearing a bathing suit that held the bag.
The bass bag in red orange with bast frans and a white leather hook was the outstanding piece of Jacquemus' Summer-2019 collection "La Riviera" at the Paris Fashion Week.
Prominent Stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I think that big hats and beach bags will be available in the shopping streets next summer. The designer has made such an impression that the demand for super-dimensional accessories will hardly be ignored.”
John Edward: Knowledge of language for world citizens essential
Scotland's independent schools continue to be characterised by academic excellence. This continued with outstanding results in 2018 and is only supported by individual and joint achievements in the fields of sport, art, music and other community enterprises.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to support their students and their parents at the highest possible level.
Independent schools pursue the goal of preparing their students for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and popular in schools as electors.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart."
This is an impressive reminder that we cannot rely on English only if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current results of this year's review show that languages with the highest levels of existence are at the top of the lists of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages achieved Note A in the higher exams.
The data collected by 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students in Mandarin achieved Note A in the higher exams, while 72 percent of students who learned German, 69 percent of students who learned French, and 63 percent of students who learned Spanish also achieved Note A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages today are seen as electives as well as STEM subjects (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the teaching plans of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 percent of the reasons why employers called for open jobs problems related to a lack of language knowledge were identified.
As a result, knowledge of language is increasingly required when it comes to preparing young people for their future career.
As more and more open places require languages, these knowledge is essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the profession chosen, young people who have learned a second language will have a real benefit in the future by such a lifelong ability.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, multilingual people will automatically provide an opportunity to compete.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent could not speak foreign language well enough to conduct an interview, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
That is why it is important for today's children that we invest now in language learning.
Children who speak several languages, especially those from developing countries, will have better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are being taught at all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the classic modern languages, while other languages will be taught which are considered to be the most important for the United Kingdom, for example Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child's interests lie, independent schools will always have a number of languages with appropriate specialized teachers.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares the children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success, as always the future looks.
At this point in a global economic environment, languages cannot be denied that they are still of fundamental importance to the future of the country, and therefore this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be regarded as 'international communication capacity'.
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron before Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James appear for the first time for Los Angeles Lakers, the wait soon has an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening game on Sunday of the pre-season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes will he play, however, is not yet fixed.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play only a few minutes.
At the beginning of this week James was asked after training according to his plans for the six-game pre-season plan of the lakers.
"I don't need pre-season games in this phase of my career to prepare me," he said.
Weather Forecast in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, a series of electoral campaigns.
This is the first five broadcasts planned by Trump for the next week, including well-informed places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the floating vote on the confirmation of his election for the vacancy at the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming mid-term elections in November, as the Republicans are in danger of losing control of the Congress.
When does Trump's announcement take place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trump's announcement in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19:00 (East Coast Time).
You can track Trump's news in West Virginia below as livestream at YouTube online.
Trump will probably address the hearings of Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, on allegations of sexual misconduct conducted this week in a tense atmosphere. The Senate's expected vote on the confirmation remains until one week in sleep while the FBI is conducting investigations.
However, the main objective of this series is to support Republicans who have to make difficult choices in November.
Therefore, President Trump's electoral team told Reuters that these five announcements would serve to "mobilise volunteers and supporters in the coming week, while the Republicans are trying to obtain and expand their majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives".
"The control of the Congress is so important to his plans that the President will travel to as many states as possible while the operational election season is near," said a Trump-voice speaker, who did not want to name his name, against Reuters.
According to West Virginia Metro News, supporters of "Ohio and Pennsylvania and media from Pittsburgh" could participate in the announcement planned for the evening at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling.
The visit on Saturday is Trump's second visit this month in West Virginia, the state that he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to support the Republican Senate candidates from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to provoke him in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows readiness to fight to maintain hope for the individual on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the four parties were probably exactly what this Ryder Cup needed on Saturday afternoon.
The swinging pendulum of the moment as a sport concept is a pure invention, but one that the players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
So where is the moment of her opinion now?
"They were in charge with six points, and now there are four, so I think that this means a little moment for us," said Jordan Spieth when he left the playground.
Europe is, of course, in favour and four points ahead, while twelve more follow-up.
However, according to Spieth, the Americans feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and can present three of four points each.
Spieth was incredibly strong from the fall to the green and went ahead with a good example.
In the course of his round, the guttural screams became louder as he lowered an important pott to decide the fourth match with four points for both of them after he and Thomas had left after two holes with two points.
His butt, who decided the match on the 15th hole for them, triggered a similar cry, which leads to the conclusion that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"I really need to get drunk and take care of my own game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left to the individual players.
18 Holes to put a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have achieved more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas and thus undoubtedly wrote the story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's unequal but sympathetic duo is at four of the four points and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was not the only couple who didn't beat a Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the back nine holes on Friday morning Bogeys.
This series and the apparently flowing energy between them and the released amount of energy undermines that they are the players to beat it on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players who win a possible European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
At the same time, both at different holes.
Speaking of European fame, however, it would be early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short process with Sergio Garcia, the four hero of the morning, who played with Alex Noren.
A Bogey and two doubles at the front nine holes brought the Spaniards and the Swedes into a grip that they could not overcome near.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them.
The four and four pairs are based on the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or do not give, and the way in which a strategy can change quickly, so fascinatingly from the point of view.
Europeans have been playing better as a team so far and are clearly in charge on the last day. However, this round has also shown that the US team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the US, had doubted.
Europe goes on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
Europe is ahead of the 4th and 4th parties from Saturday to the United States with 10:6 and is taking a solid lead in the last day of the Ryder Cup.
The brilliant Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two victories over the difficult Tiger Woods and could thus book four points in Le Golf National.
The European team, led by Thomas Bjørn, who wanted to win the lost trophy in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the four of us in the morning against the failed American team and won the show with 3:1.
In the fourth parties, the US won more resistance and won two matches, but couldn't recover the resistance.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the twelve players played on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood won four consecutive points as the first European newling, while Molinari and Molliwood, who were baptized after a sensational weekend of Molliwood, only won four points as the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup in their four opening matches.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they harmonised excellently and beat the decapitated Woods and the American Newling Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who had slipped through two matches on Saturday, occasionally let his brilliance shine, but now 19 of his 29 matches lost in fours and fours and seven in sequence.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the 4th of the morning, returned and played the 4th party as partner of Henrik Stenson. She won 2+1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant windy day in southwest Paris did not go all the way they imagined.
The three-time Major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the table for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
In the fours, they won a dozen 2–1 victory over the Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter playing for Spain and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the fours 4‐3 after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it has only occurred twice that a team came back after four points had been left alone. However, as a title holder for Fury's team, a decision is sufficient to preserve the trophy.
After two days just standing in second place, it doesn't look like they could start a counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea's Foreign Minister said on Saturday before the United Nations that continued sanctions would deepen their suspicions of the United States and that under these circumstances the country would not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea had taken significant steps in the past year because of 'good will'. For example, it stopped nuclear and rocket testing, decommissioned nuclear testing sites, and committed itself not to increasing nuclear weapons and technologies.
"But we don't see any corresponding reaction from the USA," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances we will not be alone at first."
While Ri confided in North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phasenwise" approach to denuclearization, where North Korea would be rewarded for successive steps, his statement repeatedly seemed significant when she did not reject a unilateral denuclearization from the past, as it had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an official US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June. Kim had assured to work on the "denuclearization of Korean peninsulas", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the Korean war between 1950 and 1953, while the United States has said that Pyongyang had to give up his nuclear weapons first.
In addition, Washington is opposed to requests for a lockdown on the strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States consists of "first denuclearization" and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and even oppose the "declaration of the end of the war", said Ri.
“The assumption that sanctions can be imposed on us in the knee is a momentary tension of people who don’t know anything about us.
However, the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our suspicions."
Ri did not go into plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US head of state had highlighted at the beginning of the week with the United Nations.
Instead, the minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korean chief of state Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: “If South Korea were the other party to the denuclearization issue instead of the US, it would not have come to this stop in the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.”
Nevertheless, the sound of Ris speech was very different from his speech last year when he said to the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target North Korea rockets on the mainland of the United States after "the evil president" Trump Kim referred to himself as a "raketenmann" on suicide missions.
This year Trump, who had threatened North Korea with the "full destruction" last year, took over Kim with the United Nations with praise for his courage in the fight against disarmament. However, he said that there was still much work to be done and that the sanctions until the denuclearization of North Korea should remain in force.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said on Thursday to the UN Security Council: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must continue energetically until we have reached complete, final and verified denuclearisation."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened its sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to finance Pyongang's nuclear-weapon and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the edge of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pjöngang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, when leaving Pjöngang, he said that progress had been made in order to be accused of North Korea only hours later, he had made "passage-like demands".
North Korea pledged this month a meeting with moon, a rocket base and an atomic complex when the United States took "appropriate measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the intended "agreements" were security guarantees given by Trump in Singapore, as well as steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course to sleep enough
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all students in primary school get more sleep this year. This is a measure against the growing macho culture to stay awake with caffeine and learn all night.
One scientist has found that students at the leading university around the world are often unnecessary when it comes to being careful.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and is in his opinion according to the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to call the course into life after he had given a lecture on the effects of sleep withdrawal on learning.
“At last a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why do I only experience it now, in my last year?’
According to her words, no one had ever told her how important sleep is. It surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The first course this year explained to the students how the basics of good sleeping habits contribute to academic and sports performance and also improve the general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and business director of the university's health services, said that the university had decided to start the course after she had found that students had fallen asleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In a section, the students see the picture of a room in a living room and click on coffee tables, curtains, training shoes and books. They receive information about the effects of caffeine and light as well as the effects of sleep deprivation on the sports performance and the importance of a sleeping frutine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep withdrawal can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cancer.
Then they will be encouraged to reflect on their daily routine through a map of the university site with interactive symbols.
“We know that the behavior of the students will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know this – just as you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health," added Professor Czeisler.
The pride that a "night shift" was still spreading, he said and added that modern technologies and the ever-increasing pressure on students made the lack of sleep a growing problem.
In order to ensure good sleep, the "secret weapon" of all students should be against stress, exhaustion and anxiety," he said. Furthermore, a weight gain could be avoided as sleep withdrawal would put the brain in the hungry mode, so that they would remain hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California, studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course. In his first year in Harvard, he completed one of his courses.
He said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to pursue a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step, all postgraduate students will be asked to complete a similar study program before entering their studies at the University of Competition.
According to Professor Czeisler, students should wake up for the time of sleep and awakening and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light", which results from electronic screens and LED lighting and can bring the Circadian rhythm out of the pace.
Livingston against Rangers 1:0: Menga Tower forces Gerard's player
The Rangers lost another outside game when the hit by Dolly Menga for Steven Gerard's uncontested team meant a 0:1 downfall at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to celebrate its first outdoor victory since the 4:1 triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holts Team added the second defeat in 18 games as manager, so that his team was eight points behind the far-reaching hearts of the Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga met seven minutes before half-time, and the poor inspired rangers seemed to have no chance of compensation.
While the Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third place and is only behind the tower.
The Rangers are also threatened with further problems when line director Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound by an object thrown out of the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that took over Air and reached the half-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, remained among the same eleven Livingston players who took the hearts one point last week, and must be thrilled how his well-trained team kept their opponents on step and step under pressure.
The Rangers dominated the ball ownership, but Livingston reached more when they had the ball.
After just two minutes, they were supposed to reach a gate when Menga's first release led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's Gate. However, the middle-field player missed his chance and shot at it.
Then a long break from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner Alan Lithgow could only pass through the back of the post.
The Rangers took control, but their game seemed rather hopeful in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos was evidently of the opinion that he should have been punished after a quarter-hour because of a conflict between him and Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson did not allow the Colombian complaints to apply.
The Rangers reached only two torso in the first half, but the former Ibrox guard Liam Kelly had hardly any difficulty with Lassana Coulibaly's headball and a caught shot by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingstone hits in the 34th minute may not correspond to the game run, it is not to be denied that they had earned him alone for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers were unable to deal with a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher shot the ball at Scott Robinson, who kept quiet and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted in half-time and exchanged Coulibaly against Ryan Kent. The change showed almost immediate effect when the wing player Morelos put in position, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to make the guests play the exact game that lies with them, while Lithgow and Halkett received a long ball after the other.
Holt's team could have expanded their leadership in the last phase, but McGregor kept up and refused Jacobs before Lithgow hit a headball from the corner.
The Rangers player Glenn Middleton also called for a fine later on after a crowd with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
German: The inventor of the geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" German: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as Geiger counter.
The geiger counter, which has since become the standard element of science, has also become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" with the apparently unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is this?"
Rogers: “It’s a geiger counter used to look for radioactive minerals like uranium.
If you install these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: "Really, I hear a knock!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention bearing his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can contribute to the immune system to “see” dehydrated cells
A new cancer vaccine can contribute to the immune system, to "see" and to destroy damaged cells.
The vaccine helps the immune system to detect distended cells as part of its treatment.
The method involves taking a patient's immune cells that are modified in the laboratory.
These cells can see a lot of common protein and are then injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that contributes to the immune system to the detection of dehydrated cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method takes an immune cell, which is modified in the laboratory so that they can see the many types of cancer common protein HER2 and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of the United States in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of various types of cancers", including breast, ovaries, lung and intestinal cancers, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method of taking and attaching immune cells to cancer cells has helped in the treatment of a leukaemia.
After his appearance at SNL, Kanye West released a pro-trump tirade and brought a MAGA cap ("Make America Great Again").
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was blown up at Saturday Night Live in the studio after he had widely praised US President Donald Trump and said he wants to join as a presidential candidate in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, "Ghost Town", and wearing a Make-America-Great-Again cap, he continued with a cannon of chimps against the Democrats and again stressed his support for Trump.
“I’m so often asked by white people, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s a racist.’
So if I were to worry about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the mission with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate's Justice Committee on the charges of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of the West Shipyard has not been sent, it has been uploaded to social media by Comicr Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock wanted to make fun of the publication about the West.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had had difficulties behind the stage because of his head covering.
“They made me look at the stage.
You said, “Don’t go out with the hat.”
You fucked me up!
And then they say that I was in a hidden area," he said to Washington Examiner.
West continues: "Would you like to see the hidden area?" He said he will "draw up my Supermancape, which means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love."
His comments triggered at least twice the calls from the audience, and SNL collaborators seemed painfully touched, Variety reported. One person said to the magazine: “It has become silent in the studio.”
West was later obliged to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, Rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a lecture entitled "I Love It", in which he was dressed as a perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA. She tweeted: “On one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU HAVE REPRESENTED THE MASSE.”
But the talk show moderator Karen Hunter tweeted, the West was just himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I want to not reward someone who, in my opinion, makes himself a harmful ideology for my community and gives himself no reward (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his “art”).
He's free.
The same applies to us." she added.
Before the broadcast, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now "The being formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dogg wore the name Snoop Lion, and of course he changed Prince, the deceased musician, his name in a symbol and then in "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince".

"Game of Thrones" Star Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Manhood
Kit Harington is known for his role as the sword of swirling Jon Snow in HBOs by the violence of the medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones".
The 31-year-old actor, however, attacked the stereotype of the macho hero. He said such roles on the screen would have the effect that boys often have the feeling of having to be strong to be respected.
In a conversation with "The Sunday Times Culture", Harington said he believed that something had gone wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxicity in the #MeToo age.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, also 31, who was also involved in Game of Thrones, admitted that he had a very "very important" solution to the problem.
"I personally find the question very important at the moment, which has been wrong with manhood," he said.
"What have we brought up with regard to the problem that we are now witnessing?"
Harington believes that television is perhaps partly responsible for the increasing toxic masculinity due to the very masculinity.
He continued: “What is born, and what has been learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that the boy has the feeling of having to incorporate this particular side of a man?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time: How do we change this?
Indeed, among the young men, something has gone wrong."
In addition, he admitted in the interview that after the end of the series he would not participate in prequels or sequels of “Game of Thrones”. He had enough battlefields and horses.
From November, Harington is seen in a new edition of Sam Shepard's "True West", the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently admitted that for him the best game of thrones was that he had met his wife Rose.
"I have met my wife on this mission, so I have thus received my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose Leslie played in the fantasy series Ygritte, the favorite of Harington's character Jon Snow, with many emmys.
In June 2018, they married Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
Only about 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
In contrast to the past, transmission took place in the majority of the new cases through sex.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials reported at a conference in Yunnan Province.
In comparison, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 in China.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in 1997 in China, but the discrimination of LGBT community members should be widespread.
Because of the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to insufficient protection in relation to sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised, among other things, general access to HIV medicines to address the problem.
Maxine Waters argues that employees let the data of the GOP senators secure, criticises "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Maxine Waters, an MP at the U.S. House of Representatives, protested on Saturday's allegations, a member of her staff published the personal information of three Republican US senators on the Wikipedia pages of the MPs.
The Los Angeles Democrat expressed the view that the allegations of "outer-right" experts and websites would be disseminated.
"False, lie and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published is intended to include the private addresses and telephone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday. During the hearing of a Senate Committee, they were published on the charges of sexual misconduct raised against the Supreme Court candidates Brett Kavanaugh by an unknown person in the government district.
The publication took place after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Puntit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the contributions was assigned Waters’ Office and published the information of a member of Waters’ Staff, reported The Hill.
"This unsubstantiated accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were threatened by these fraudulent and false accusations – was in no way responsible for ensuring this information.
This unsubstantiated accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie."
Waters’ statement quickly triggered online criticism, including that of Ari Flecher, a former press speaker of the White House.
"This Dementi is angry," Fleicher wrote.
“This leads to the conclusion that she does not have the right temper to be a member of Congress.
People who are accused of something they have not done should not be angry.
You mustn't be proud.
You must not question the complainant's motives.
They must be quiet and left."
Flesher Waters’ reaction seemed to compare with the criticism of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of acting too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
On Twitter, Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate in the mid-term elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great thing, if that's true," he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed the competent authorities and the prosecution authorities of these fraudulent allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they are taken into account for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff".
Criticism of "Johnny English – You only live three times" – weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit references in any British-coloured new film. This seems to apply to this revitalization of the action comedy parody franchise "Johnny English" which began in 2003 with "Johnny English – The Spion, who sneezed it" and in 2011 with "Johnny English – Now right".
Will an ironic self-parody on the subject, as we obviously see, be the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the license of the globular, grizzly, and incompetent Johnny English was extended to massage for the second time. His name indicates more than anything else that he is a general comical creation for cinematographers in a non-English space.
Of course, he is once again the busy secret agent who is bizarrely cool and world-class, while in reality he has contributed to the song of "The Hour of Victory" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
In addition, the figure was originally based on the chaos of retired travellers and international secret agents, who played Atkinson in the currently forgotten Barclaycard TV stores.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I felt as Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor and the rotor blades were close to his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comics is increasing, but the humor seems rather weak and rare, especially because the "serious" film series such as "007" and "Mission Epip" now offer some self-evident comedian elements.
Humour seems to be more about children than adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy miscarriages are not as effective and focused as Atkinson's stupid movie gags in the role of Bean.
The eternal present prize is now that Britain is in great danger.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents in use, very to the detriment of the incumbent agent, a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last strawhole for the Prime Minister, a bloated and troubled figure that is already faced with the complete collapse because of her political unhappiness: Emma Thompson gives her best with this Quasi-Teresa-May character, but the script does not produce much that she can work with.
Their Secret Service consultants inform them that all active spies have been disbanded and therefore have to get someone out of rest.
This is also part of Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a smart institution, but informally teaches in work as an undercover agent. There are a few gags, because English offers a espionage academy that remembers "School of Rock".
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency discussion and reunited with his former hard-tested Kumpan Bough, which is played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a U-boat commander, a nervous woman of the higher society, whose role Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a waste.
So Batman and Robin, who are always making all the terrible mistakes in the service of your Majesty, are back in action. They meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously engaged in the band of a charismatic tech billionaire, the window Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy. He claims to be able to solve the computer problems of Britain.
English and Bough start their Odyssey of the Great Späße: As a waiter dressed they put a fine French restaurant in Brand, they make sure of chaos when they smuggle on board Volta's luxury yacht, and English dissolves pure anarchy when he tries to make himself familiar with the inside of Volta's house with a virtual reality headset.
In this last sequence, although all the records are drawn, but so sympathetic and funny it is also, the topic is already dealt with in detail in children's television.
Pretty moderate matter.
Like the other Johnny-English films, I had to ask myself, "Can the British film industry Rowan Atkinson not play a role that his talent can really play?"
Labour struggles to work on a plan after which the British work four days a week but should be paid for five days
Jeremy Corby's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan that provides that the British work four days a week, but will be paid for five days.
The party intends to report that the company's executives share the savings achieved by the KI revolution (artificial intelligence) in the form of an additional day off.
This would allow employees to have a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same payment.
According to sources, the idea of the Party's economic agenda and its plans to shift the balance in favour of workers in the country is appropriate.
The shift to a four-day week was promoted by the Trades Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A high-ranking source from the Labour Party said against the Sunday Times: “A directive review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"A change will not occur overnight, but a four-day working week is an effort that is consistent with the Party's approach to restoring economic balance for workers and the Party's general industrial policy strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea. The Green Party had already promised to launch a 4-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the approach is currently not supported by the Labour Party at all.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day week is not a party policy and is not taken into account by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell concreted his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy last week at the Labour Conference.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of "anonymous directors" and "profit makers" in public supply companies.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of the water supply companies may not retain their full share, as a Labour Government could undertake ‘deductions’ due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed the relevant plans to recruit employees in the management of companies and to set up inclusive ownership funds to transfer 10% of the equity of private companies to employees who cash out annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy express themselves in the press '60 minutes', whether the FBI's investigation in the Kavanaugh case could change their opinion
The FBI investigation into the proposals against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has moved a final vote on his appointment as Judge at the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises the question whether the results of the Authority could affect Republican senators in order to gain their support.
In an interview on Sunday, the 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring something to their attention, which could eventually change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“I informed in the negotiations that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after, this claim was made, and asked if he had done it.
He was determined, determined and incomprehensible."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be buried in stone.
"My opinion is clear about Brett Kavanaugh, and it had to be a bomb," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has been very much fighting this," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she called couldn't confirm it."
It's 36 years now.
And I can't see any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has been contributed in this festival to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York, the Global Citizen Festival will be held to fight poverty in the world with an impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission.
Tens of thousands will attend the Global Citizen Festival, which will take place this year for the seventh time, to experience not only the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event: the fight against extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. As part of this project, an international interest group is trying to combat poverty by encouraging more and more people to participate actively in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you have to complete a number of tasks. These include voluntary work, communication with a leading politician worldwide (by email or telephone) or similar measures to raise awareness of the goal of combating poverty.
How successful is the project when you think that Global Citizens remain 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of putting in perspective a cool free concert a reasonable opportunity to convince others that it is time to act, or just another case of so-called clictivism – if you think you can change something by signing an online petition or by sending a tweet?
Global Citizens reported that the project has been able to list more than 19 million actions from its supporters since 2011.
These actions should have contributed to encouraging leading politicians around the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group quoted 390 commitments and announcements arising from their actions, of which at least $10 billion was already paid or purchased by fundraising.
According to the Group's estimates, the funds secured so far have direct effects on almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are the The Power of Nutrition project, a partnership of investors and implementers based in the United Kingdom who have committed themselves to supporting children in their optimal development and who have promised to help Rwanda with 35 million dollars in combating malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," the Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the public during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, following more than 5,000 actions with which Britain was invited to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the The Power of Nutrition project to reach 5 million women and children and provide nutrition interventions.
As an answer to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely the question of why global citizens can fight extreme poverty,
They replied: “It will be a long and strenuous path with heights and depths.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, as we are together stronger and more influential.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the artists who perform at this year's New York event, including Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as moderators.
The US could use the Navy for blockage purposes to prevent Russian energy exports – Ministry of the Interior
According to Washington Examine, Washington can take back to the Navy if needed, so that energy from Russia does not reach markets including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke told us.
Zinke claimed that Russia's use in Syria is a pretext to explore new energy markets. Russia is currently acting on the invitation of the legal government in these areas.
"I think that the real reason for Russia's use in the Middle East is the negotiation of new energy markets, just as in Eastern Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are means and ways to do this.
"The United States can, together with the Navy, ensure that the waterways remain open and block them if necessary to ensure that energy from Russia does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke turned to the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group that is understood as "the voice of electricity consumers" in the United States.
He drew a comparison between Washington's approaches in dealing with Russia and Iran and found that they were practically identical.
"The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia," he said, while he described Russia as "One Trick Pony" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The declarations were made when the government was under Trump to extend exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe and thus replace Russia with the far more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, try to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inadequate" pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump Berlin, became "captured" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline is worth $11 billion, which is intended to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres in order to be an exclusively economic project.
The Kreml argues that Washington's massive resistance to the project is based on economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we are all thinking that energy should not be used as a means of exerting pressure and that consumers can choose the suppliers themselves," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The US has received a counterwind from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), has called on the United States to refrain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It's a big problem if a third country interferes with our energy supply," says the Board of Directors of the BDI Dieter Kempf after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to "examine a presidential candidate 2020 exactly," says the Senator for Massachusetts
The Senator for Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would "examine a presidential candidacy after the elections.
During a city hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidate.
According to The Hill, Warren said it would be time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
After 6 November, Warren plans to examine a presidential candidacy.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump was heading in the wrong direction.
"I am extremely concerned about how Donald Trump deals with our democracy," she said.
Warren did not take a leaf before his mouth in his criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that a FBI investigation was needed before the vote.
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of the Warren elections did not believe that they should run for 2020.
According to the survey of Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe, 58 percent of the potential voters in Massachusetts indicated that the senator should not run.
32% of voters supported such a candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick; with 38 percent who advocated a potential candidacy, and 48 percent who are opposed.
Among the other names of prominent democrats involved in a possible candidate for 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden shared that he would decide officially by January.
Sarah Palin talks about the Donald Trump-Ralley post-traumatic load disorder, under which the track Palin suffers
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What makes my son go through, what he goes through when he comes back, can feel everything other families that feel the effects of PTBS and some of the wounds that our soldiers return with," she told the public at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to his arrest as an "Elefant in Space" and said about her son and other war veterans that she had returned changed, that they had returned pregnant, that they had returned and wondered whether there was respect for what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military had given to the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson of the Wasilla Police Office.
18 States and D.C. support a legal aid to the new asylum policy
18 States and the District of Columbia support a legal aid to the new US policy, refusing to victimize gang activity or domestic violence of asylum.
Representatives of the 18 federal states and the district issued a statement of jurisdiction in Washington on Friday to support an asylum-seeker who questioned politics, NBC reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace anti-session complaint filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy was not disclosed.
She reported that her partner "and her violent son used them, but US officials refused her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers who support Grace called El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people apply for asylum in the United States, as nations that have major problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy raised a decision of the Board of Immigrant Appeals of 2014, which allowed illegal immigrants to apply for asylum in the face of domestic violence.
The Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "does not ignore decades of legislation at the state, state and international level".
"The Federal Act provides that all asylum applications are assessed on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application and that this court is in breach of this principle," was stated in the Court of Justice’s statement.
In addition, the lawyers argued in the statement that the policy that immigrants refuse access to the country has an adverse effect on the US economy, as immigrants could be more active than entrepreneurs and could provide the necessary workforce.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered that victims of immigration courts fleeing from domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs should no longer be granted asylum.
"There is asylum for all who leave their country because they are persecuted or afraid because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political belief," the session said in its announcement of the policy of 11 June.
It was never the plan to eradicate all problems by granting asylum, even all the most serious problems that people have to deal with every day worldwide.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu as the number of victims in the race doubles with time
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"It's all very tense," says 35-year-old Risa Kusuma and calms her little son in a rescue center in the destroyed city of Palu.
“Every minute a new car comes with dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce."
The inhabitants returned to their ruined houses to collect their most abundant wealth and goods and to hide everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the employees of the hospitals, who were damaged by the earthquake with the strength of 7.5, were completely overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who increased vertebral fractures and a broken shoulder, remained outside the military hospital of Palu, where patients were treated outside because of the ongoing strong neighborhoods.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the severe earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"Everything went too fast.
I think I was stuck under the fallen walls," he reported to the Associated Press, adding that the reason for the stay in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s help, but then it was calm.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I can only hope they're in a safe place."
U.S. Ambassador of China's Tirana with "propaganda advertisements"
One week after an official Chinese newspaper had turned on a four-sided advertisement in an American daily newspaper, in which the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China were announced, the US ambassadors in China accused the capital of Beijing of exploiting the American press for propaganda purposes.
The United States Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China's paid addendum to the Des Moine's Daily Register, the largest magazine in Iowa, after accusing China of insuming itself in the US Congress elections on November 6th, a charge that China contests.
Trump's allegations that Beijing has tried to intrude into the U.S. elections are consistent with US officials' statement to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign, triggered by Washington, to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to turn off advertising to promote the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently turning into an out-of-the-art trade war, with customs duties on imports for both countries.
The Chinese payroll at the beginning of the trade war should meet exporters in states such as Iowa who supported the Republican Party of Trump, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa, who exports agricultural products to China to a large extent, reported that Beijing has damaged workers, owners of agricultural holdings and companies.
China, according to Branstad in an opinion in the Des Moine's Sunday register, now doubles this tyranny by switching off advertisements in its own free press in the United States.
"With the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government claims the tradition of free expression and the independent press, by switching advertising paid by the country to the Des Moines register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, you will find only a limited number of votes in Beijing at the newspaper's kiosks and do not find any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese might have on China's disturbing economic development, given the fact that the media is firmly in the hands of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that one of China's most famous newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article. However, he did not name the newspaper.
Republikans distribute voters before the elections with the debacle around Kavanaugh, alert observers
Since many of the most influential Republicans support and defend the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in view of several allegations of sexual violence, observers have warned against a counter-reaction during the forthcoming elections, which could be particularly women.
The vote in this context was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already indicated that they continue with a vote.
"These things can't be undone," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last minute advance was sufficient for an FBI investigation to accommodate angry voters.
"Women do not forget what happened yesterday, they do not forget it tomorrow and not even in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, first consultant and national spokesperson for the progressive MoveOn group, so the daily newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators in the Senate's floor area called "November is coming!" when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to hold the appointment of Kavanaughs and, despite the statement by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, told Mic.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation were an extremely important issue, said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political observer on the news page.
"People say it's already high, that's true.
But it could be higher, especially among voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, people between 18 and 29, who, although they do not like the president, often do not choose."
Even before Ford's public statement, in which their allegations of sexual assault against the candidates of the Supreme Court are detailed, observers pointed out that a counter-reaction could be the result if the Republicans submitted the confirmation.
"This situation is a mistake for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, according to NBC News, at the beginning of last week.
"It is not only about the vote of the board, the final vote or the review of Kavanaugh; it is also about the way the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have treated it," Guy Cecil, Director at Priorities USA, told a group that supports the election of Democrats, the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to agree who they should believe because of the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly larger share being placed on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of the respondents were definitely or probably convinced of Ford’s statement, while 35% indicated that they definitely or probably gave Kavanaugh beliefs.
In addition, 38% indicated that they believed that Kavanaugh had probably or definitely lied in his statement, while 30% indicated the same over-ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford and at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, reported, The Guardian.
Ford made a solemn statement last week before the Senate's Justice Committee that she was attacked by the drunk Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had exposed her genitalia when she was at a party during her studies in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new web to oppose Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching the market with the aim of establishing a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The newest project of technology legend, inruptt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
With Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee suggested that the intention behind the intrusion was the "welthership".
"We need to become active now," he said about the topic of startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology so that users can create their own personal online data storage or a POD.
It can include contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library as well as other tools for the private and business area.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content is available in a browser and at the same time.
The particular feature of the personal online data storage is that the user alone can decide who can access the data.
The company refers to this concept as personal strengthening and data development.
According to the CEO of John Bruce, the idea behind the intrusion is that the company uses resources, processes and corresponding abilities so that solid is available to all.
Currently, Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been appointed to work on this project, as well as a community volunteer programmer, are part of the company.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers worldwide can create their own decentralised apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team will not exchange with Facebook and Google on whether to make a comprehensive change, where their entire business models are completely redesigned overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In a contribution to the medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that inruptt has the task of providing commercial energy production and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new solid web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee created a redesign of the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a major participant in the debate on net neutrality.
Even with the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely confident about this new era of the web," he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, wearer of the Victorian Cross in World War I, was honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England, who was distinguished as a fighter with the Victorian Cross during World War I, was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Colonel and priest Bernard Vann won the award due to his involvement in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sharp shooter and never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
His two grandsons revealed a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Sunday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, thought that this act was full of symbolism, since the monument was revealed exactly 100 years after the herotat for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Colonel Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918; through dense fog and under fierce protection of field cannons and machine guns.
Later, he pushed forward to the line of fire and led the line forward with the "greatest bravery" before turning off three of the military units with a field weapon in front of him.
Colonel Vann was shot on October 4, 1918 by a German sniper; a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were something he could never have done, and at the same time something that would make a person humble.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he put down a crane after the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he felt very honoured to be able to participate in the parade, and added that the daringness of a real hero would become visible, especially by supporting many people.
MMA fans stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206 instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you've been awake all night to watch an exciting caller 206 and then you can't watch the main event.
The San Jose bill included 13 fights, including 6 on the main card, and was broadcast live all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 p.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for their fight, the viewers in the United Kingdom were not shocked to see Peppa Pig suddenly.
Some remained untouched after staying awake until early morning to see the fight in particular.
A fan described on Twitter the change to the trick film figure as some kind of bad joke.
"Because of a government regulation, these contents are not classified as youth-free, so that they had to be switched to a child delivery at 6 p.m.," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President in the field of marketing and communication at Bellator when he was asked about the transmission.
"Peppa, the pig, exactly."
The Board of Directors at Bellator, Scott Cocker, announced that the company would be working on the plan to take into account future UK observers.
"I think the problem could have been solved by playing again," he said.
“But it is 6 a.m. on Sunday morning with the viewers in the United Kingdom, and we will not solve the case until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we're staying.
It was pretty good and it wasn't always nice.
We have tried to solve the problem, and we have assumed that it is a technical disturbance.
What was not the case was a problem from the government.
I promise, it won't happen that way again.
We will reduce the whole to 5 instead of 6 fights, as usual, and we have tried to offer the fans the best possible experiences.
The whole situation is rather sad."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels "understand" on the subject of sexuality
Tom Daley, who took part as a water jumper in various Olympic games, says that he grew up with the feeling of being subject to everyone else because of his sexuality. But this feeling had motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old thought that he had only realized at the next school that he was different from others.
In the first radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke on the subject of sexual rights to encourage others.
He also meant that since he became a father, victory at the Olympics is no longer so important to him.
The real moderator of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses sickly for a few months.
In Laverne's first mission, he said that he used to view himself as inferior in comparison with others, since love for boys and girls was socially totally unacceptable.
He said: “To this day, the feeling of submission and being different from others is a reason for my power and strength and finally for my success.”
He wanted to prove that he was a very special person to disappoint no one when his sexual orientation was known.
The double bronze medal winner in the Olympics is today a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to promote the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said that he had spoken on this subject because fortunately he could live without restrictions and without discrimination and would like to do other courage.
The three-time world champion fell in love with the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The realization of falling in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said that the age difference had never been an issue.
He thinks that if you had to spend so much as a child and youth – he took part in the Olympics for the first time and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone of the same age with similar experiences.
Since June, the couple has had a son who bears the name Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley believes that his whole view has changed since then.
Even last year, everything would have turned into gold medals.
But for him there are now more important than Olympia gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main winner.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after the diagnosis of brain tumor.
Daley said that his father did not accept the imminent death, and one of the last things he asked about was the tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to be with it before.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be there anymore," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after that it became clear to me that he was not invincible," he continued.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics.
"I only knew it was always my dream to dive in the Olympics before the local public – that was crazy," he said.
His first selection of songs – Proud by Heather Small – was also influenced by them. He heard the song in the foreground of the Olympics and was still responsible for günse skin.

Mickelson, who is currently not in shape, sits at the Ryder Cup on Saturday at the substitute bank
The American Phil Mickelson will make a record at his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he has to work very hard to keep the whole thing from becoming a debacle.
Mickelson, who played at the 12th time event, was sent to the replacement bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Rather than as usual being at the center of the event, the five-time Majors spent his day setting fire to others and working at his game, hoping to correct the problems he was facing.
Even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old Mickelson was never the directest golfer and thus no ideal occupation for the narrow Le Golf National golf course where missing balls are regularly punished.
And as if the place itself wasn't discouraging enough, in the ninth game on Sunday, Mickelson meets the perfect British Open-Champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined Tommy Fleetwood, Neuling at these tournaments, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans with four points stand a hot start at the 12 individual games, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely decisive.
Furyk spoke with confidence about Mickelson and could not add much to it.
"He was completely about his role today in the clear, gave me a slap on my back and put his arm around me and thought he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has quite a lot of self-confidence.
He is one of the world-renowned personalities and has done so much for these teams in the past and also this week.
I didn't think he was in two games.
I had more idea, but that's how it's going and that's what we've been expecting.
He wants to be like everyone else."
Mickelson will reach Nick Faldo's record for most of the Ryder Cup games released on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup track that never matches the top points of his personal record.
Mickelson was able to score 18 wins, had to score 20 losses and reached seven half-times, although Furyk announced that his presence had already enriched the team.
"He's funny and sarcastic, original and he likes to make some fun, and he's a great man who's popular with the whole team," he said.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little closer this week. It was fun to watch them.
He's a really interesting person who gives a lot of impulses."
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that it may soon pass with the advance
Thomas Bjørn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great breakthrough that leads to the last individual games in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
The dance debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seven Ballesteros had a lead of five points against the Americans, but only barely crossed the target line and took the lead with the smallest possible lead and won a victory of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"The thought remains that we had a great lead in Valderrama, we had a great lead in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but that's only short," said Bjørn (pictured in the photo) after he had seen the victory 5–3 of the Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
Experience shows me and all the team members that it's not over.
It's gonna be okay tomorrow.
Put yourself in the test and do exactly the right thing.
The whole thing is over when the points are on the display table.
We have a goal. We want to win this trophy, and right there is our focus.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are fully aware of what we are facing on the other side: the best players in the world."
Joy over the performance that his players had performed on a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: “I would never miss it.
Tomorrow's gonna be another caliber.
Tomorrow the individual benefits are at the forefront and that is a completely different thing.
It's great to work with a partner when things are going well, but if you're alone out there, then you'll be tested up to the limits of his ability as a golfer.
You have to make this clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you let your partner behind you and he must also get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will see to it that his players cut each better than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of that big turn on the last day of the tournament. He was in Brooklyn on the winning side before he was on the side of the losers after Europe's "Wonder of Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he answered to the question as Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to withdraw the fast-start that you have seen in Brooklyn and in Medina.
If the moment hits a direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send out our boys as we feel, you know, we're trying to magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to the task of defeating Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the upper half of the rankings.
"I have decided for the boys in this order because I think it covers everything," said Bjorn about his selection for the individual meetings.
Germany's new warship is delayed again
The latest Fregate of the German Navy was scheduled to be deployed in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War that came in the years. However, local media suggest that it will only be delivered to local media due to faulty systems and fast growing costs next year.
The launch of the ‘Reinland-Pfalz’, the leader of the brand new frigates of the ‘Baden-Württemberg’ class, has now been moved to the first half of 2019, according to the time it took on a military speaker.
The ship should have been put into service in 2014, but the ambitious project of disturbing problems after delivery was called for.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, which were ordered by the Navy in 2007, are intended to replace the old frgates of the Bremen class.
They are intended to include a powerful cannon, a series of air defence rockets and marine target aircraft, as well as tar technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic flexion.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest frigates do not have to return to their home port for up to two years.
However, the continued delays can lead to the ageing of the highly modern warships to be represented by Germany as a seamstress at the time of its launch, says The Time.
The F125 Fregatte followed the accident last year when the German Navy officially refused to take off the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship after its delivery to the shipyard.
There was little information on the reasons for the return, however, German media called a number of significant "software and hardware errors", which made the new ship useless in a fighting situation.
Software problems are particularly serious as ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are served by a crew of only 120 mattresses, only about half as many as on the older frgates of the Bremen class.
It was also known that the ship is too heavy, which leads to performance losses and prevents the Navy from carrying out any upgrading measures in the future.
The 7000 tonnes of heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" was apparently twice as heavy as ships with a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the costs of the entire project, including the training costs of the staff, became a problem.
The costs seem to rise to €3.1 billion, compared to the originally planned €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly important in view of the latest warnings that the German Navy is shrinking.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the German Bundestag's Wehrman, confirmed that the Navy "has been able to use the ships".
Bartels said that the problem with time grew, since old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the frgates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be removed from the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
In an estate in the Scottish Highlands, new research works are carried out to show how bats use the landscape in food search.
It is hoped that the results will provide further insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to guide future nature conservation activities.
The study carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will detect fungus and funguses as well as brown Langoghr and water fungus in Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key positions on the property to record the activities of bats during the entire season.
Employees of the NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with portable detectors.
In an analysis of the noise of all the recordings by experts, the frequency of the flyer mouse calls is determined and determined which species does what.
A map and a report of the living space will then be drawn up to produce a detailed picture of their behaviour at landscape level.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Protection Advisor, hopes that the results will show which areas of life are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
These data will help determine the benefits of the measures to manage the habitat, such as the creation of meadows, and show how forest areas for bats and other related species can be obtained.
The bat stocks in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development works that affect sleeping places and lead to the loss of the living space.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flying prisoners and chemical treatment of building materials or attacks by house cats.
Flying mice aren't really blind.
However, because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a miscarriage to detect insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland takes the topic of bats very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts who regularly carry out investigations, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue measures.
The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only bat reserve in the Thrave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's 10 bat species.
Goods Manager David Thompson explains that the existence of the ideal living room is for her.
"Here in Thrave we have a great area for bats," he explains.
"We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent living room.
But there are many things that we do not yet know about bats, so here and in other goods we carry out these works that will help us learn more about what bats need to feel well."
He stressed the importance of first excluding the presence of bats before maintenance work in the goods, since it was possible that the accidental destruction of a single nest site would kill up to 400 females and young animals and destroy the entire population on site.
Flying mice are protected and it is illegal to kill them, insult them or destroy their nesting sites.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish staff member of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the people to help.
She explains: “We still have to learn a lot about bats and in many of our species we don’t know what it’s like for their populations.”
Ronaldo argues that violence is being proposed, while his lawyers want to report the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the violence against him as "Fake News" and said that people wanted to be "famous" by using his name.
His lawyers plan to report the news magazine The mirror that published the charges.
The stormer of the national team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently he then paid her $375.000 to buy her silence to the event, says The Mirror on Friday.
In an Instagram live video to its 142 million followers, the 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports only hours after their release as “Fake News”.
“No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News," said the five-time winner of the Ballon d’Or in the camera.
“They want to profile themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to be famous with my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is good," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to report the mirror on the allegations they have made, according to Reuters, as "an unacceptable report on suspicions in the field of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player demanded a compensation for "moral damage at an altitude corresponding to the gravity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years."
The alleged event was scheduled to take place in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in 2009.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped them according to documents submitted by the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went to the knees after the alleged incident and said that he was "99 percent a good guy", which was "one percent".
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that the two had sex, but say it was a consensus.
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and had taken photos of her injuries in a hospital, but later admitted to an extrajudicial agreement, since she had "fear before retribution" and made sure to be "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said that she was now trying to lift the agreement, as she was still traumatized due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to switch from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged incident and changed this summer into a 100 million euros heavy deal to the Italian giant Juve.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would “repent” the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "oppose it forever" if after Brexit it lost its status as a world leading manufacturer of cars, says Economy Minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was "disturbing" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily suspend production in Burnaston's work at Derby, UK should leave the EU.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer stated that the influence of delays at the border at a no-deal brexit could lead to job loss.
The work in Burnaston, where Toyotas product lines Auris and Avensis are produced, produced almost 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I am convinced that we will experience production stops in our work at an uncontrolled Brexit end of March," says Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyotas in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised concerns about a hard EU exit without agreement and its impact on cross-border trade.
BMW says, for example, that it will close its mini-works in Oxford after the Brexit for a month.
The main concerns are, according to the car manufacturers, linked to risks within the supply chain to a hard Brexit.
Toyotas manufacturing plant is operated on a "just-in-time" basis, which means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from both the UK and the EU to make the cars on order.
Should the United Kingdom leave the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be interruptions that could lead, according to the industry, to delays and bottlenecks in the parts.
It was not possible for Toyota to carry a stockholding in the Derbyshire plant that lasted longer than a day, the company explained why production had to be interrupted.
Clark stated that Theresa Mays Chequers' plan on the future relationship with the EU "is precisely designed to avoid such controls at the border".
“We need a deal. We want the best deal that enables us, as I have already said, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity,” he explained in Today’s BBC Radio 4.
"The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we must be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far."
Toyota could not state how long production had to be interrupted, but warned in the long term that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the work and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been employed in Burnaston for 24 years and is the highest official of the union, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience is that these jobs will never return once they are gone.
One government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's planned meetings with Rosenstein could be postponed again according to White House data
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be "moved for another week", while the dispute over the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continued, was called from the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein has examined the supervision of the work of Special Envoy Robert Mueller, who investigates the interlocutors of Russia, the connections between Trump's consultants and Russia, as well as the possible impediment of justice by the President.
The question of whether Trump would fire the Deputy Justice Minister and thereby endanger Mueller's independence has been the subject of rumors in Washington for months.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein called for the secret recording of his talks with Trump and the President's office with the help of the 25th Constitutional Supplement.
Rosenstein demented the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while new reports about his alleged resignation were announced.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was held at that time at the UN General Assembly in New York, was announced for the coming Thursday,
Trump explained that he would not let Rosenstein go, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid that it coincided with the hearing before the U.S. Senate Senate, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who had abused him sexually, said.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of the protests against Kavanaugh, thus delaying the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press spokesman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
To a question about meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “A date has not yet been set for this. It could be this week, but I can still imagine that it will be postponed for another week, in view of all the things that are going ahead with the Supreme Court.
But I always like to keep the press on the run."
Some reporters would object to this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders explained that the low frequency of the press conferences did not put a tendency towards the TV reporter's "effect hassle" but added: "But I would not argue that they operate effect hassle."
She then claimed that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President makes more questions and answers rounds than any president before him," she said without giving any precise proof: "We have seen these numbers."
There will still be press conferences, says Sanders, but unless the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly but far better than to talk to me.
We are trying to do this often and you have seen that we have done this often in recent weeks. This will take the place of the press conference if you can speak with the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visitors.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this is so when he performed a bizarre performance in front of reporters gathered in front of the row.
Minister of Health writes because of Brexit's concerns about EU employees of the Scottish NHS
The Minister of Health addresses people from abroad who work in Scotland National Health Service (NHS) to express their gratitude to the country and to express their wish to remain in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already declared itself willing to bear the costs of applications for residence permits for EU citizens working in the decentralised public service of Scotland.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “In the course of the summer, the exit negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU were continued and decisions are expected this fall.
However, the British government has also strengthened preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I'm aware of what disturbing times this must be for you all.
That is why I would like to express once again how much I am contributing to each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues and colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is full of your home and we would be very happy if you stayed here."
Christion Abercrombie was subjected to a head injury after a not operation
The linebacker of the Tennessee State Tigers Christian Abercrombie was subjected to a not operation on Saturday at 31-27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to information from Mike Organ of Tennessee State.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, explained to reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half-time break.
"He came to the page line and was just broken down there," says Reed.
Trainer and medical personnel provided Abercrombie on the oxygen line before being carried out and transported for further investigations.
A speaker from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville,Tennessee that Abercrombie had left the OP in the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "not yet known details of the nature or extent of the injury" and Tennessee State tried to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called Redshirt, plays in its first season at Tennessee State after changing from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 Tackles, thus increasing his total number in the season to 18 Tackles.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom
Foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp tax in the future for the purchase of properties in the United Kingdom.
This step is intended to facilitate the success of Jeremy Corby's campaign for young voters
The increase in the stamp fee will apply to all who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance accounts for up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee if you buy properties in the United Kingdom, while the multiple revenues will benefit homeless people.
This step is an attempt to slow down Jeremy Corby's success with young voters, which promises to provide more affordable living space and take top winners into sight.
The increase in stamp tax will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
In addition to the current tax on stamps and including the increase introduced two years ago on second flats and rented dwellings, the increase could be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance is counting on the step with additional revenue of up to 120 million pounds per year.
Estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by investors who are not resident in the United Kingdom. Thus, prices are driven up and it will be more difficult for first-time buyers to walk in the real estate business.
Many of the country's affluent areas, especially in the capital, have become "insect cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy follows only a few weeks after Boris Johnson has opted for a reduction in stamp tax in order to enable more young people to start their own home.
He accused construction companies of raising the real estate prices by purchasing land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable apartments to end Britain's 'dwelling scandal'."
Opposition leader Corbyn announced a series of proposals for housing reforms, ranging from a rental price bond to the ban of rooms without a valid reason.
He also wants to empower city councils to build new apartments.
May stated: “Last year, I said that I would devote my time as prime minister of the recovery of the British dream, according to which the life of generation should be improved.
And that means repairing our broken apartment market.
Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it cannot be right that it is as easy for people who do not live in Britain as it is for companies based abroad to buy property as it is for heavy-working British citizens.
The dream of the home has become too far away for many people and the worthlessness of innocence remains too big a problem."
Jack Ross: “My biggest goal is to manage Scotland”
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says it is his “greatest goal” to ever become the manager of the Scottish team.
The 42-year-old bulkhead enjoys the challenge of bringing in a new life to the club from the north-east of England, which is just in third place in the League One and the three points are missing.
He moved this summer to the stadium of Light after taking St. Mirren back to the first Scottish league in the last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I created it on the bank and it was ‘s’," said Ross of BBC Scotland’s sports sound.
“But I’ve seen as a child with my father often playing Scotland in Hampden and that’s something that always pulls me back.
However, this possibility would only come if I were successful in the management of the association."
Ross predecessors in the role include Dock Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic said not to be afraid to enter the footsteps of such established names at such a club after he had previously refused offers of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success will be measured at the moment whether I can bring the club back to the Premier League.
In view of the structure and possibilities of this association, he is undoubtedly a member of the Premier League," he said.
“It is not an easy task to get him there, but I would probably consider my time here only as a success if I brought the association back there.”
Ross can present a first three-year management career, after a phase as deputy chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month activity as a coach in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the religion into the third league and helped St. Mirren from the edge of the religion to win the championship in the next season.
Ross says he now feels better than ever before in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"That was probably a real way of separating," he recalls when he took over the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really think management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds funny because I didn't get a bad job, I was able to live well of it, and I experienced some very pleasant high phases.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things you have to spend every week.
I'm still doing this because of stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I do it. I've never felt so well in my skin in my whole life as an adult."

The perfect time for a glass of beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., so a study
The heat wave in the summer has missed a boost on the revenues of British crystallized pubs, while the restaurant chains were under greater pressure.
Pub and bar companies recorded sales growth of 2.7 per cent in July. However, revenues at restaurants are falling by 4.8 per cent according to statistics.
Peter Martin of CGA’s company council, which compiled the figures, stated: “Sustained sunshine and England’s longer than expected continued participation in the football world championship meant that July followed a similar pattern as previous June, in which pub’s sales increased by 2.8 percent. However, the restaurant found it even more difficult.
The fall of 1.8 percent, which the restaurant industry recorded in June, continued in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on drinks showed the best performance at a distance, with a surface-cleaned sales development that increased higher than it did at the restaurants.
Pubs with focus on food also left in the sun, but not as drastic as the restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars, the rate of drinking increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while the three per cent cut back on the food."
Paul Newman, from the analysts for the RSM leisure and hospitality industry, stated: “These results continue the trend that we have been able to observe since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for sales in the Out-of-Home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to face problems, but sales revenues of 4.8 percent over the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to the ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for operators of companies focusing on food, and it remains to be expected that the more appropriate temperatures will be provided in August with the urgently needed atempause."
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, accounted for 2.7 percent in July and reflected the decline in the brand-rollouts.
The industry sales monitor Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active companies for the pub, bar and restaurant area in the United Kingdom with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds and is the recognized industry benchmark.
One of five children has secret accounts in social media that hide it from his parents
A study shows that every fifth child, some just 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that keep it secret from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 students in further schools found an increase on so-called 'Fake Insta' pages
Message implies that sexual content should be posted
Twenty percent of students said to have a "main account" to show it to their parents
One of five children, some just 11 years of age, creates accounts on social media that can keep it secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in further schools showed a rapid increase in so-called "Fake Insta" accounts, an installation to the Photo-Sharing Instagram website.
The message implies fear that sexual content will be shared.
Twenty percent of students indicated having a clean "main account" that they could show their parents, but also own private accounts.
A mother who stood on the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged the other to “ rape me.”
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of the 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, with half the admission to own private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, president of the HMC, said: “It is disturbing that so many teenagers are being seduced into creating online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Elidh Doyle will be "vote of athletes" in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilid Doyle was elected as a non-executive member at its annual general meeting in the Council of the Scottish League of Athletics.
Doyle is Scotland's most outstanding lightweight athlete and President Ian Beattie described the election as a great opportunity for sports officials to benefit from their extensive international experience over the last decade.
"Eilidh is respected in the light athletics community of Scotland, Great Britain and the world and we are sure that light athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from their election to the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am happy to act as a voice of athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution and lead the sport to Scotland.”
The American, who won over 200 and 400 meters in 1996 at the Olympic Games in Atlanta, named a total of four Olympic gold medals his own and today often appeared as BBC experts, could no longer run after a transient bleeding disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't run anymore.
Doctors say no one can tell me if or how far I'm going to heal.
It was hard work, but I recovered completely, learned to run again and make movements today!
Thank you very much for the encouraging news!"
An advertising for milk pumps that compares mothers to cows ensures excitement in the network
A manufacturer of milk pumps provided an exciting network with an advert in which silent mothers are compared to cows' milk.
In order to introduce the market, according to its own specification, the 'sweetest milk pump' is published by the manufacturers of consumer technology Elvie a non-serious music video to emphasize the freedom that the pump imparts to silent mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a cow-filled barn with cows in the background to a song containing the text lines such as: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any cock at me" or "if you haven't noticed it, it's not yours but my breasts."
In the refrehend it goes on to say: “Pump it out, pump it out, feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, milk my ladies.”
However, the advertising published on the company's Facebook page has triggered a controversy on the network.
With 77,000 accesses and hundreds of comments, the video focused on mixed reactions among the viewers, many of whom say it does not harm the "fears" of the milk industry.
“It was a very bad decision to apply for this product with cows.
As we do, they have to become pregnant and produce a calf to produce milk, except that their boys are taken away within a few days of birth," said a comment.
Elvie's milk pump fits gently into a quiet-BH (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment was: “Achievable traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to apply for a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another person added: "So a reality-based advertising."
Others defended the advertising and a woman said that you found the song "urcomic".
“I think it’s a great idea.
I'd have bought myself one if I'd still shut up.
When I was pumping, I felt like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to reinterpret it.
This is a great product," wrote one person.
Another person commented: “It’s a funny advertising aimed at mothers using milk pumps (often at work or in toilets) and feeling like “cows”.
This is not advertising for or against the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that everyone danced in their BHs with the discreet pumps.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women using milk pumps indicate that they feel like dairy cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses and fits discreetly into a still-BH, allowing women to move free to keep their babies or even to leave during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, stated: “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative market introduction.
By comparing silent mothers with milk cows, we wanted to focus on milk pumps and all the related challenges, while at the same time presenting the incredible sense of freedom that enables the new pump.
This is not the first time that Elvie's pump runs into the beating lines.
During the London Fashion Week, a double mother appeared for designer Marta Jakubowski on the Catwalk, while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were brought quietly and quietly to a tent town on the Texan border
The number of internally displaced children is as high as ever, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively equal, including the increased rhetoric and measures of the Trump government have made it more difficult to bring children to the caretakers.
Traditionally, most caregivers themselves were illegal immigrants and now are afraid to become the target disc for an appointment when they report to take a child.
The risk increased in June when the Federal authorities announced that potential managers and other adult members of their household had to print their fingerprints and that these data were shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Customs Immigration and Customs Enforcement, announced before the Congress that the Authority had arrested dozens of people who had claimed the care of unaccompanied minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 per cent of the detainees had no prior entry in the criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of people who are either themselves a guardian or a member of a household of a guardian are illegally staying in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
That is why we will continue to pursue these people," Albence explained.
In order to be able to handle children's cases more quickly, officials introduced new rules which, according to the staff of the accommodation in some children, required to appear within a month rather than 60 days after the entry into custody, which was the standard.
Many will appear on video and not on their own to appear before an immigration judge for their legal status.
In the event of negative decisions, the person is quickly postponed.
The longer these children stay safe, the more likely it is, according to the information provided by the accommodation staff, as well as reports that have been reported in the last month from the system, that they will be anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or outbreak attempts.
Defenders say that these concerns will be reinforced in a larger facility such as Tornillo, as there signs that a child has problems will be more easily overlooked due to the size.
They also explained that traumata, which many of the children already suffer, can strengthen if they are brought into a tent without emotional preparation or sufficient time to settle with friends.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish “Central Forces” to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on the Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war in the country is now in the eighth year.
Moual, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil and were “treated appropriately” with the pretext of the fight against terrorism.
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem argued that the "war on terrorism is almost over" was in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions more have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus "will continue to fight this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleansed" by both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has stationed some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian Arabs who have been recruited against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1000 soil troops in the war-stricken country.
As for the refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return were given and he accused "some Western countries" of spreading "irrational fear" from which the refugees refrained from going home.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to enable homecoming," he said.
"They are actually politicising a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that no building aid would be granted to Syria unless there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN diplomats stated that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major Rebellenhochburg Idlib represents the opportunity for pre-ledging political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a wide-ranging offensive of the Syrian troops supported by Russia into the province in which three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that military action against jihadists, including combatants of the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, would be carried out.
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee that consists of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
At the moment, the Syrian Government called for participation in the Committee and stated that its work should be limited to "recasting the articles of the current Constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win his reelection
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020, should not, as many liberal spectators are likely to expect, terminate his presidency in advance of an official election or scandal.
This would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finale of a presidency of all time".
So far, there's no sign that it's been set by the viewer.
Since 2014, the transmission rates for the best transmission time at CNN have doubled to 1.05 million and have almost doubled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reaches an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best time of the broadcast, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBCs "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the switching rates with up to 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
"It's like a fire that attracts people magically, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Bear, Showrunner of the "Designated Survivor" drama series on TV station ABC, about a cabinet member, the president will be destroyed after an attack on the capital.
Nell Scovell, a former comedy writer and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Trusts About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has another theory.
She remembers a taxi trip to Boston before the election in 2016.
The driver told her he'd choose Trump.
She asked him why.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh’’” Scovell told me.
Chaos have value for entertainment.
Of course, the stories from Washington can be found on the contrary to everything on TV, the future of the principle decision on abortions Roe v. Wade, which determines the possible integration of families and the health of the global economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.

I'll never see Super Mario again with the same eyes for my part.
“A part of what he does, it can feel like a reality show that he holds every evening,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series “The Three of the Pfandhaus”, about Trump’s rotating occupation and daily action (a fight with the football league NFL break from the fence, Kim Jong-un award).

He simply could not get rid of the screen, not if Judge Brett Kavanaugh was just before the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.

Donations of cash with the strictest race around congress seats during the elections
It is not surprising that the 17th electoral district of Pennsylvania is overrun by donations, thanks to the newly withdrawn boundaries of the electoral districts, which led to two officials standing around the same seat.
The recently redesigned suburban district in Pittsburgh is allowing the Democratic Conor Lamb to join, who won his seat in another district in the course of a special election in the previous spring.
Lamb is opposed to another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is deeply intertwined with the new 17th district.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were against the Constitution and were manipulated for the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district resulted in an exchange of electoral funding between the parties' large financial weapons, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was known in Pennsylvania after a short victory in a widely observed special election in March around the 18th electoral district of the state.
This seat was held over a decade by a Republican and Trump won there with 20 percentage points of lead.
Politicians allow the democrats to take a easy lead.
The US checked El Salvador's punishment for its support for China, but then turned back
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognized, without encountering great opposition from Washington.
Trump completed a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama to partner the management team of the Trump Organisation.
Officials of the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided to withdraw the heads of all U.S. foreign missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "the latest decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, spokesperson of the Ministry in an opinion at the beginning of the month.
However, only in El Salvador's case were thought of criminal measures, which were estimated at $140 million in 2017 for US aid, including for drug control, development and economic aid.
The proposed criminal measures, including reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder.
During internal meetings, North and Central American officials moved a high-level conference on security and economic well-being to follow a similar meeting in the previous year and a step forward in their efforts to prevent migrants from moving towards the United States.
However, in mid-September high government officials made it clear that they wished the conference to take place and thus effectively ended the consideration of criminal measures for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now scheduled as a speaker at the conference scheduled for mid-October to give a sign of importance to the Assembly's government, according to diplomats.
The three U.S. diplomatic representatives are quietly and quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new strong communications or criminal measures from Washington.
A spokesperson for government by John Bolton rejected an opinion on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed, subject to anonymity, to comment on the internal discussions.
Their opinions were confirmed by one of the government's close external analysts, who also spoke under the terms of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next major surprise could be the report by Special Envoy Robert Mueller on Trump's possible lack of justice, for which there is now sufficient evidence in the public.
Mueller is now also allegedly investigating whether Trump's electoral team has conspired with Russia in its attack on the US elections.
Should the majority of Congress change, Trump sees himself confronted with an organ that makes him accountable, precisely at the time when he is preparing to appear before the electorate; and perhaps before a jury.
These are many “whens” and I do not want to say that the case of Donald Trump, or of his European pendant is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we need to make decisions that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938, German officers were willing to carry out a coup against Hitler, if only the West had resisted him and the Czechoslovakians had supported him in Munich.
We have failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the constant march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are just ahead of several such turning points.
What do we do when Trump releases Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who decides on the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein ran into Devil's kitchen since last year's newspaper reported that he proposed to record the president secretly and speculated about it, though it was inappropriate for the office.
Rosenstein demented the presentation of the New York Times.
“How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh’s newly ordered FBI investigation is not complete or fair or is confirmed in spite of credible allegations of sexual abuse and misdemeanour in the office?
And above all, are we going to vote in the elections for a congress that forces the Trump to take account of?
If we fail in these tests, we will have a long winter ahead.
But I believe we will not fail because of what I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czecho-Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz from the same regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me off 60 years later to light up Sabbath candles on the table with the hook cross.

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers optimistically ahead of the game against Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive remission against Villareal in Spain at the beginning of the month will bring her to a good position for the qualification of the Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans could not appear to be equal to 2-2 against Villareal, but he believes that the rangers can use this result as a springboard for larger ones.
"That was an important point for us, as Villareal is very good," said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with the conviction that we could do something about it and we drove home with a point.
Perhaps we could still have won at the end, but overall an undecided was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we worked in the second half and then were the better team.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
Hopefully we get three points, but this will be a difficult game, as they have achieved a good result in the last game. But I am sure that we can go through it with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a kind of well-being factor.
The team is good and the boys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now look forward, leave the last season behind and be successful."
Fear of age care leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the survey participants knew exactly how to care for them, only a few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the nationwide study reported talking to your partners about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said to talk to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but do not take the necessary steps to conduct the conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Life Insurance Party of Nationwide.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and the children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you want to be treated, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the costs.
Get your financial advisor on board: Your advisor can also help you to find a way to finance these expenses.
Your financial decisions for long-term care can include a traditional care insurance, a hybrid capital life insurance to help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own assets - as long as they have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Turn legal disputes in the last minute.
Set up a precautionary authority to order a trusted person to monitor your medical care and to ensure that health professionals comply with your wishes, you should be out of line to express them yourself.
Consider also a mandate for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid, you should not be able to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about taking medicines or allergies?
Note these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"Not only financial questions play a role. Who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What is the medicinal product?"
Who cares about the dog?

Men in Ilfracombe shot several times with a gun
A man was shot several times with a gun when he went home after work under friends.
The victim, a man in the forties, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, belly and hand.
Officials describe the shots that were appropriated around 02:30 British time as "willing act".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries were not life threatening and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, so the authorities were allowed to increase the number of deaths.
Because of the resulting communication systems, aid forces were unable to obtain information from the Dongala government district, an area north of Palu, which is located at the epicenter of the earthquake with a strength of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunamis took place.
Dongala is a government district located in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi, located over a coastal section of over 300 km (180 miles) long.
In the government area, an administrative unit under the province, 299,200 people lived in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of revenue from the Central-Sulawesis economy, in particular the coastal region of Dongala.
The Nickellabbau is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesis.
Palu and Dongala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis, according to the Indonesian disaster protection authority in the last 100 years.
In 1938, over 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
West Dongala was hit by a tsunami in 1996 in which nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Pacific Fire ring and is regularly visited by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a massive earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and cost the lives of 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of which in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands in front of the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6,8 shook the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed nearly 700 deaths.
2009: An earthquake of 7,6 struck the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West-Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of 7,5 shook one of the Mentawai islands in front of Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters high, which destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A slight earthquake shocked the government district of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time, a tsunami was not triggered, but more than 100 people died from crashing buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the popular Indonesian island of Lombok and, above all, claimed over 500 deaths on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily beached on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former Governor Alaska and former candidates for the vice president's office, was arrested for alleged bodily injury.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, the prevention of domestic violence and the resistance to state violence, a report published by the Alaska Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took off the phone when he wanted to understand the police.
According to KTUU, Palin is under investigation in the Mat-Su Pretral Facility and a deposit of $500 has been raised.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where when he was asked for his petitioner with "not guilty, quite sure", the network replied.
Palin is accused of having committed three class A irregularities, which can be punished with up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B disorder that can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time Palin's convictions have been raised.
In December 2017 he was asked to attack his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being negotiated before the Veteran’s Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was subjected to domestic violence, the prevention of the notification of a crime and possession of weapons under the influence of anti-cancer agents in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend told him you'd hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterinary organisations in 2016 after she returned her son’s behavior to post-traumatic load disorder as a result of his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that shocked the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The strike with a strength of 7.5 triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Power and communication networks are interrupted and it will be assumed that the number of deaths will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place just ahead of the Central Sulawesi coast, which is located north-east of the capital of Jakarta, Indonesia.
On social networks, videos circulate from the time the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutor's Office requires rare death sentences for suspects in New York's terrorist attack
The New York Federal Prosecutor's Office calls for the death penalty for Sayfillo Saipov, the defendant in the New York City terrorist attack, which cost eight lives. This is a rare penalty that has not been imposed in the state since 1953 for a federal crime.
The 30-year-old Saipov is charged with using a rented pick-up of the building market chain Home Depot for a terrorist attack, while in October he rode on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan and then took over pedestrians and bike drivers.
In order to justify the death penalty, the plaintiffs must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "targeted" and added "conscious" serious bodily injuries, so the statement of intent for the death penalty filed in the southern district of New York states.
Both charges could be punishable by death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a Federal Investigator Saipov filed an indictment in 22 points, covering eight counts of the murder in front of the background of the organised crime, which is usually used by federal lawyers in cases of organised crime, as well as an indictment of the violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack calls for 'basic planning and purpose', the plaintiff who described the way in which Saipov carried out the act as 'absolute, cruel and corrupt'.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov added to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damages, pain and loss," said the statement.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
For more than a decade, the southern district of New York has no longer pursued a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers and eventually sentenced to a life sentence in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in New York at a federal offense was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were convicted two years before the conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were set up on 19 June 1953 with the electric chair.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, testified in the days and months following the attack of a lack of reue, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, so the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was actually inspired after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, so the indictment.
He also called on police to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room.
He declared himself innocent in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the public defenders representing Saipov, stated that they were “depressed of course” by the decision of the Public Prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of a debt in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma that will afflict all the parties," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecution not to demand the death penalty.
A member of the Conservative Party calls on NIGEL FARAGE to transfer Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize "the power of the people" today during a protest station during the conference of the Tories.
Ukip's former leader said that politicians must feel the pressure of the Eurosceptics, while a member of Theresa Mays Party suggested that Farage should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative rear banker Peter Bone told the protesters in Birmingham that the United Kingdom "would already be outside" if Farage Brexit was minister.
The challenge facing May in reconciling its deeply fragmented party was compounded by the fact that members of your party who are for a stay in the EU took part in a separate demonstration against the Brexit that took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has trouble keeping his compromise plan Chequers on course despite attacks by Brexit defenders, Brexit opponents and the EU.
They agreed that despite the counter-reactions, they should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels and thus force Eurosceptic and the opposition Labour Party to decide between their package and the 'chaos'.
Bone stated on the “Leave Means Leave” demonstration in Solihull that “checkers belong to the garbage”.
He proposed that a farage be named a peer and that he be held responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we would already be out," he said.
Wellingborough's MP added, "I'm going to stand for Brexit, but Chequers belongs to the trash."
His opposition to the EU emphasized: 'We have not fought in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected claims that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and now want to stay in the EU is completely wrong’.
Brexit advocate of Conservative Andrea Jenkyns was also on the demonstration and declared reporters: ‘I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The compromise is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and with our activists, who actually go through the streets and make sure that we are elected.
Please give up chequers and start listening.’
In a clear message to May, she continued: “Ministers keep their jobs if you keep their promises.”
Farage stated in a statement that politicians need to “taste the pressure”, they should be right in deceiving the decision of the 2016 referendum.
“It is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class”, Farage said.
“They are trying to cheat the Brexit and therefore we are here today to say to them, ‘You will not come from it’.
In front of an enthusiastic crowd, he continued: ‘I want you to let our political class, which is just before betraying Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We are mobilising the power of the people of this country, which will help us to win our referendum and never come to rest, until we are an independent, self-regulatory, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before they held a two-hour broadcast in the city centre.
A few activists swayed banners of the Tories Against Brexit Grouping, a group of Brexit opponents within May's party, which was launched at the weekend.
Lord Adonis, Peer of the Labour Party, was amused by the Tories who had security problems with a party app when the conference was opened.
“These are the people who tell us that they can ensure that the IT systems, as well as all the technology for Canada Plus, for the seamless border, are available for free trade without borders in Ireland,” says Adonis.
"It's a farce.
There's just no good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to “examine exactly” the presidential candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that she would "examine the presidential candidacy carefully" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke on Saturday at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts about their future.
Warren, a prominent critic of President Donald Trump, is currently in the race for the re-election of the Senate against the Republican MPs in the Parliament of Massachusetts Geoff Diehl, who was vice president of Trump's electoral team in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was the focus of speculation that could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format since Trump's arrival.
One of the people present asked if you would like to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that for women at the time it would be "to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top."
Arrested after shooting at LSU players Sims
The Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested on Friday in the event of the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference to have arrested 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man to be seen on the shootings.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot on Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims suffered a head injury and died as a result of this injury," said police chief Murphy J. Paul's sports portal 247 sport on Saturday to the media.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been at the tent and possession of a gun and shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incidents and taken into custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two meters big Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 start-ups in the last season and was able to display on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Great price of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of the world champion after his team has left him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time that Valteri Bottas landed on Saturday in qualifying before Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Stallords of Mercedes would play a major role in the race.
From the Pole position from Bottas managed a good start and it was almost as he led Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel first went into the box and let Hamilton hit traffic at the end of the driver's field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went a round later into the box and landed behind the vettel, but he took over Hamilton after a short wheel-an-rad-manover, in which the Ferrari pilot pushed the inside to endure the risk of two movements to defend the third curve.
Max Vertappen started at one of the rear squares of the field and was on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round seven in place.
He was then for most of the race of the fastest, as he held on to his tires to quickly finish and take over Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Finally, he went into the box in round 44 and did not succeed in adding a step to the remaining eight rounds, while Raikkonen finished as fourth.
It was a difficult day since Valteri had brought an excellent performance all weekend and how a real gentleman had acted when he should have let me through.
The team has done excellent work to achieve a double victory," says Hamilton.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Diane Feinstein at a poll on Saturday, who insisted that Christine Blasey Ford's letter, in which he presented to the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh sexual abuse, not to the press.
At the event in West Virginia, President Fords spoke not directly before the Senate's Justice Committee, but commented that the proceedings in the Senate show that people are "common, forested and dishonest".
"One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate in the last few days is when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and angry and mean and dishonest," said the President.
"When you look at the leaks and then say, "Oh, I wasn't.
I wasn't."
Do You Recall?
Diane Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Thinks about your answer... Publish the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Okay, just a minute.
Did we... no, we didn't publish it," he added by imitating the senator's voice.
Feinstein was awarded the letter with Ford's charges against Kavanaugh in July and was published in early September. However, Feinstein argues that the leak comes from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't publish your story," Feinstein told the Committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter secret and I answered her request to keep it secret."
Your dementi did not seem good to the president, who said on Saturday evening at the election event: “I tell you one thing, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continued defense of the judge's candidacy, which three women have been subjected to sexual abuse, the Democrats claimed that they would use the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
You can see the community, the wickedness, they don't care about who they hurt when they leave under the wheels to gain power and control," the president said mediae.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer won two towers for the giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made the defeat on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants through a 5:3 victory in the back in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants went early with two doors leading, after meetings by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team compensation before Dwyer restored the leadership of the giants.
Francois Bouchard just for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen won the victory with two doors.
This was unexpected for the men of Adam Keefe, the Dundee on Friday 2-1 in Belfast, the third defeat in the Elite League in the season.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giant winning the previous three parties.
Dwyer's opening door took place in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes after a presentation by Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later David Rutherford delivered the presentation when Beauvilier expanded the lead.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game after 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt Cownie helped his balance sheet after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer ensured the leadership of the Giants before the half-time break when he reached his second gate of the evening shortly before the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again with a Power-Play meeting in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen to lead Dundee for the first time in the party late in the second half of the time. Nielsen then assured his team of victory with a fifth gate after almost half of the second half time.

Flyers died after he made sure hundreds of people in an aircraft escaped the earthquake
A plane in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after death to secure the safe launch of a plane with hundreds of people on board.
Over 800 people died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was terrified on Friday by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami.
Strong neighborhoods are still to be found in the region and many people are trapped under drums in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save your life, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agg refused to leave his posts in the heavily fluctuating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in order to be sure that the flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, was safe.
He jumped out of the tower when he thought he was crashing.
Agung died later in the hospital.
Johannes Sirat, spokesperson for the Indonesian Air Safety Service, explained that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
“We have provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could arrive at Palu.
We are deeply concerned about this message," he added.
At the same time, the authorities are afraid that the number of deaths could increase to several thousand. The disaster protection authority of the country stated that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number is likely to increase as many bodies are still under the rubble, while others cannot be reached," said the spokesperson for Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 6 meters high have destroyed Palu, which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a new car comes with dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, leader of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, CNN stated: “The Indonesian Red Cross is about to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday and declared in an address to the country’s military: “I ask you to work all day and night to carry out all the eviction tasks.
Since you've been ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was already shocked by earthquakes in Lombok this year in which over 550 people died.
Flight crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini reports now from a missing aircraft crash in Lagune
The airline that conducted the flight, which crashed into a peaceful lagoon in Micronesia, now reports by a missing person, after first claiming that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini stated in a statement that they could not say anything until Saturday afternoon about the stay of a passenger.
The airline agreed to work with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane had crashed into the water when trying to land on the Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials reported that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline reported that on Saturday there were six passengers in the hospital but were in a stable condition.
The cause and exact course of the accident remained unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy explained that the plane landed in the lagoon shortly before the railway.
Some witnesses thought the plane flew off the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very flat.
"That's a very good thing," says Jaynes.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to water through deep water to the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants were panicking and screaming and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors working close to the improvement of an landing were using a blowable boat to help bring people to the coast before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
The data from the Aviation Safety Network suggest that 111 people have died in crashes from airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them involve Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the course of the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution concluded its evidence in the renegotiation of a case in which a man was alleged to have banned a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst at the U.S. Ministry of Justice Paul Rowlett said for hours that he was an expert in the field of information evaluation.
He explained to the jury how he, on the basis of phone calls, reconstructed the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on her death night.
Rowlett said to have received position data from different phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of her death. This contradicts his previous statements, according to the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers during the time he said he had been at his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford went into the witness on Saturday and said he wasn't in the city on the day.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis had told the truth when he indicated that he had been at Sanford's Pick-Up this night, Sandford said he had lied, "because my Pick-Up was in Nashville."
Another objection was that Tellis indicated that Chambers had known at their death for two weeks.
But phone records indicated that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis had left his cell some time after Chamber's death.
"He took them out of his life," says Hale.
The defense will probably begin with their plaintiffs on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the procedure is then before the jury on that day.

One more black?!
New Yorker Children's Girls Complained Couple for Disengagement after "racist" SMS
A New Yorker girl complained about a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from her mother, in which she complained that she was "one more black".
The couple struggles to be racist and compare the legal dispute with an 'expression'.
The double mother Lynsey Plasco-Faxman expressed her dismay when she discovered that the new mother of the day, Giselle Maurice, was black when she entered her first working day in 2016.
"NOEEEEEEEEEEIN, ANOTHER SCHwarZE," Plasco-Faxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending this message to her husband, however, she sent the message to Maurice.
After she recognized her fauxpass, she released the "paintly touched" Plasco-Faxman Maurice and claimed that the open African mother had done bad work and instead had been expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her day of work and then sent home with an upper.
Maurice now sues the couple for compensation for dismissal and makes a claim for compensation for the 350 dollars per day, which she should last for over six months, the job for which she was originally booked, but without contract, and for which she would have been used with the couple.
"I want to show them, look what you don't do," she said on Friday, "I know that discrimination is."
The couple rejected the racist proposals and argued that the release of the reasonable step was because they feared Maurice, after they had offended her, could no longer trust her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," explained husband Joel Plasco of the Post.
“But would you trust your children in a person who was rude to them, even if it was out of the question?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the legal dispute with an "expression" and explained that his wife was expecting a baby in just two months and was "in a difficult situation".
“Do you want to interest such a person?
This is not very nice," added the investment banker.
While the legal dispute continues, the couple was quickly condemned in the public and urged on the social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not identify themselves with a talking bear revealed a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, said about the letter: “It is difficult to move into someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
Today it's very funny with our knowledge today about Paddington's huge success."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, had no problem with that, would have been rejected and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication after his death was "bitterly sweet" last year.
She explained that her father was secretly proud of Paddington's success, which she describes as "very important family member".
"He was a very quiet man and didn't wash," says Jankel.
“Because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child that does something special: you are proud, even though it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think he's seen Paddington's success.
Although he invented it and created it, he always gave Paddington himself the responsibility for his success."
My daughter died, and I had to vote for her over the phone.
After the country, her daughter was brought to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors secretly tried to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say that it was really bad and that the doctors gave her little chance," says Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received the call from Nad, in which he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to vote for her.
And I did.
I said to her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my darling."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications you gave the doctors to keep their heart at pumping slowly sound off and leave their body.
She died just before, and this was the moment as everything went down.
I couldn't wait until I knew what was going on.
I couldn't scream or yell because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really needed to get together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning the loss of her daughter, went along with the other passengers who did not get anything from what she was doing, on board the plane.
"No one knew," she said.
I had lowered my head and cried all the time over the waves.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women hang cards to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost their family through a suicide try to keep others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and telephone numbers for consulting points.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he started suicide.
"I don't want parents to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Forty-five-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son had a promising career as a cook and had a burning smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said his smiles could brighten up a room."
However, he announced his job before his death, since he was “in a really dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler's body was found after the suicide by his 11-year-old brother.
Davis said: “I am always afraid that this could have an effect.”
Davis has designed the cards “to show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it is a friend.
Don't be silent: you have to talk about it."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was 15 years old, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was depressed or depressed," she said.
“A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
And he was on the bottom of the ground on Christmas Day, and when the children took out their gifts, he saw them neither in their eyes nor in their eyes.
She said that her death was a great trauma to her, but that she had to say through it: “It is a huge hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must all continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's Future in the Sweep while the FBI starts investigating
"I thought if we could actually get something like this that he asked us to do, that is to say, a temporary and limited investigation, then maybe we could get a little intervention," Flake said on Saturday.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want to investigate the FBI?
Your will can only lead to timing.
The elections on 6 November are only five weeks away. If the Republicans cut off badly as expected, then they would be significantly weak in their attempts to choose their husband in the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh. He had worked in the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley, Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There is a vote in the Senate in which 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow the Vice-President, Mike Pence, to decide on the basis of equality of vote and to confirm it for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean overruns “low” under Kim
The number of North Korean passers-bys to South Korea has fallen to power since Kim Jong-un seven years ago, such as a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, who relies on data from the South Korean Reunion Ministry, stated that in 2011, 1127 surpluses were registered last year, compared with 2706 in 2011.
Park called stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices of human smugglers as main factors.
Pyongyang did not make a public statement about this.
The majority of the surpluses from the north are finally offered to South Korean citizenship.
Seoul states that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most fly across China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China regards overcrowds as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often brings them back with violence.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is technically still in the war state, has improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the two Heads of State met in Pyongyang for talks on the agreed denuclearisation negotiations.
As a result of the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, where they generally agreed to work on a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused US sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without being able to rely on the United States, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to unarm ourselves unilaterally first," said Mir Ri in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh " hysterical" and says that he is not fit for office at the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called judges Brett Kavanaugh " hysterical" and said that he was not suitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could not deny the impression that a woman who had acted as such would have been described as "hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate's Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh demented in an emotional way all charges that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both teenagers were.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he cried almost and stood in tears shortly before speaking about his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the charges against him a "big and coordinated assassination", organised by Liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton's lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's statement proves that he could not serve at the Supreme Court, as she showed that he was pre-empted against the Democrats.
"I believe that he himself has declared himself to be indifferent to these statements and the way in which he spoke about the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked whether she would try to remove Kavanaugh from the office, he should be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so much: if he does not tell the Congress or the FBI the truth, then he is not only for the Supreme Court, but also for his current judicial positions," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned about possible Kavanaugh's decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the draft decision Roe v. Wade, as he was regarded as a conservative judge.
In his hearings, I asked Kavanaugh whether he would revise certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“We don’t need a hysterical, pre-adopted person who goes to this court and expects us to say, ‘I’m not wonderful’, says Pelosi.
Women must use it as a weapon.
It is a sincere hate speech, months and years of overcrowding anger and it does not get out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Stein told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's rare, and you?"
She continued: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she also wept when she got angry, but developed a technique. When she gets angry and starts to cry, she tells the person she said to her: “They may think you’re sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just keeps talking.
I thought it was great."
Tears are permitted as a valve for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is to a former job, in an office dominated by men, where one day I cried because of an indescribable anger and was dragged into a stairwell by an older woman, a cold manager, before whom I was always a little afraid.
"Let her never see you cry," she told me.
“They don’t know you’re stinking.
They believe that you are sad and will be happy with you because they believe you have gone to the substance."
Patricia Schroeder, then a convention deputy from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when hard on board a ship called Monkey Business was acquired in an exceptional affair and then withdrew its candidacy, the most frustrated Schroeder wondered that there was no reason to even consider the idea of the presidential candidacy.
"That wasn't a well-thought decision," she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation “Snow Whites and the Seven Swedes”.”
As the election campaign had already progressed, she was behind the fundraiser and vowed not to run if she was not supposed to get $2 million together.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found that some of her supporters, who spent $1,000 on men, supported her campaign with only $250.
"Do you think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
In the speech in which she announced not to launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration over the system that the procurement and direct address of the electors instead of the delegates, and anger over sexism.
"You could have assumed that I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls to the press reactions.
“I could have believed that the pocket towel manufacturer Kleinex was my sponsor.
I still remember wondering what they'd write on my tombstone.
"You're crying?"
Why Beijing could benefit from the US-China trade war
The opening of the trade war between the United States and China was earring. Although the battle has not been over for a long time, Beijing could benefit from a dig between the countries in the long term, my experts.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, fired the first warning shot at the beginning of the year when he presented important Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminium, with fines.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new fines on goods worth $200 billion, which effectively affects half of all goods imported from China to the United States.
Beijing beat back in the same way every time and recently raised fines from five to ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to respond to any US measure and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economic power will soon come to an end.
To move Washington to the entrance, it would be significant to suggest, but would be a public evocation against the United States too much fun for China's President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, China could benefit in the long term from the effects of the trade war by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision could create the conditions for economic turbulence in both countries in Washington or Beijing is actually much more dangerous than many observers have previously recognized," says Abigail Grace, a scientist who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security Memorial Factory.
Syria is 'ready' for the return of refugees, according to the Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country that has been devastated by the war for over seven years.
In a statement before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the circumstances in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is rebuilding the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions have now been given for the voluntary return of refugees to the country which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and living conditions.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government welcomed help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that it would not be possible to accept conditional aid from countries that had supported the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the Ryder Cup 2018 and beat Team USA with an end of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National near Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the US.
The American Star Phil Mickelson, who had problems with most of the tournament, lowered his defeat on the 16th train (Par 3) in the water and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all its rounds and became one of 4 players who achieved a 5-0-0, since the tournament started in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was hit 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in the team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world's best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against the Englishman Ian Poulter, who possibly played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran from eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to win back the pod.
It is about the team and I am happy to have made a contribution," said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He goes further to his countryman John Rahm, who won the American Golf Legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1 at the individual meetings.
I'm so proud to have beat Tiger Woods that I've been watching on television since my childhood," says the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup balance of 13-21-3.
A remarkable statistics for one of the greatest players of all time who has won 14 important titles and is only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had to find the fairways throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who performed high-quality performances throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I am proud of the boys, they have fought.
There was a time tomorrow when we put Europe under pressure.
We didn't do anything about it.
Hut for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players gave up a good performance.
We will regroup, I will talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will look forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We've been defeated."
