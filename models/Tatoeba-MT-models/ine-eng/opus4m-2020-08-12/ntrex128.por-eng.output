Members of the Assembly of Wales are afraid to "pass through Marretas"
There is a confusion on the part of some Members of the Assembly of Wales (AM) about the suggestion that their title be changed to MWP (Parliaments of the Gales).
The origin of this controversy is in the plans to change the name of the assembly to "Gaels Parliament".
Some members of this assembly, from all the political colors, fear that this will make them fall into ridicule.
An AM worker stated that the group is concerned by the fact that "the designation rhyme with Twp and Pwp".
For non-Galese readers: in the Galese language, "twp" means "idiot" and pwp means "excrements".
An AM of the Plaid stated that the group in its global "was not content" and suggested alternatives.
One Welsh Conservative said that the group was "open-minded" about the change of name, but said that the designation MWP was verbally very close to Muppet (Marreta).
In this context, the letter w in Welsh has a pronunciation similar to that of the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Commission of the Assembly, currently drawing up legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: "The final decision on how Members of the Assembly are appointed will obviously be taken by themselves".
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 gave its assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which included general support for the proposal to appoint the Assembly as the "Gaels Parliament".
On the issue of the title of AM, the Commission favoured "Galese Parliament Members", or WMP, but the MWP option was more favoured in a public consultation.
Apparently, AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the effort to bring consensus together can be a headache for President Elin Jones, who should present a draft legislation on amendments within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the way the assembly carries out its activities, such as rules on the disqualification of AMs and the setting up of the commission system.
When they discuss legislation, the AMs will have the final word on how they should be designated.
Macedonia will refer to the change of country name
The voters will vote on Sunday on the change of name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a conflict for decades with neighboring Greece, which integrates a province with the name of Macedonia.
Athens has been insisting that the name of its neighbour to the north constitutes a claim on its territory, repeatedly objecting to its requests for membership to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, the opponent of the plebiscite on the change of name, said he would ignore the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is no more than the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
Sinos de St. Martin calms down at a time when the churches of Harlem fight for survival
"No historical perspective, the elderly I spoke to told me there was a bar and a church on each corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there is no one else."
The disappearance of the bars, he said, understood.
"People socialize differently" today, he said.
"The bars have stopped being the living rooms of the neighborhood where people go regularly."
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned about the chance of the money gained with the sale of heritage not to last as long as the leaders expect" and that sooner or later everything will return exactly to the starting point."
The churches, he added, can be replaced by buildings of apartments with condominiums inhabited by the kind of people who will not support the sanctuaries of the neighborhood that still remains.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore this will hasten the arrival of the day when these churches will all close, for it is unlikely that most of those who change to these complexes will join these congregations."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was then established by a black congregation that carried out its worship in the immediate vicinity.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation under the auspices of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott to the 125th Street waiters, an important commercial street in Harlem that resisted the recruitment and promotion of black employees.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged. However, when plans were made for its reconstruction, Father Johnson’s parishioners ordered the carriage.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the carriage "the ashes of the poor".
The specialist who touched the carriage in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
This specialist, Tiffany Ng, from the University of Michigan, also mentioned that it was the world's first carriage to be played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to the largest carriage in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What happened in St. Martin's in recent months was a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, some brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that this "would seek to pass over the costs", was bad enough that it had not been involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Tuberão causes injuries in 13-year-olds in a lobster hunting dive in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during a hunting dive to the Lagos in California on the first day of the Lagos season, the authorities said.
The attack occurred shortly after 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour as much as he heard the boy screaming for help, having then finished in his direction with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said he thought initially that it was only about enthusiasm for catching a lobster, but that he later realized that the boy was shouting "I was bitten"!
I was bitten!
The whole clavicle area was dilated, Hammel described what he observed when he arrived at the boy.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: "There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by air to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego, where he was admitted to critical status.
The species of tuberculosis responsible for the attack is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was considered not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries at the top of the trunk.
The authorities closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and security reasons.
Giles reported that there are more than 135 species of tuberculosis in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the United Kingdom cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with cosmetic sections in the style of large warehouses, supported by specialist assistants.
As part of a substantial initiative to gain a share in the UK cosmetics market, estimated at 2.8 billion pounds, which has continued to grow as fashion and home sales decrease, these major cosmetics sections will be tested in 11 shops scattered by the country and will be implemented in more shops in the year that comes if their success is demonstrated.
This investment in cosmetics comes from the search for, by supermarkets, ways to use the exhibition space otherwise used for TVs, microwaves and articles for home use.
Sainsbury's mentioned that it would duplicate its catalogue of beauty products with up to 3000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L'Oréal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with brand areas similar to shops such as Boots.
The supermarket network is also relaunching its range of Boutique makeup so that most of the products comply with vegan recipes, something increasingly required by younger buyers.
In addition, the perfume shop The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's shops, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London, last week. The second, in Selly Oak, Birmingham, is expected to open near the end of the year.
Online shopping and changing food shopping habits for small daily quantities in nearby shops have led supermarkets to now have to work harder to persuade customers to visit their shops.
Mike Coupe, executive president of Sainsbury's, said that shops will increasingly resemble large stores, at a time when the supermarket chain is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl discount shops with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been installing Argos sales points in hundreds of shops, having also installed a series of Habitats, since he acquired both chains two years ago, and claims that this has strengthened sales of merchandise products and made purchases more profitable.
The company's previous attempt to renew its cosmetics and pharmacy departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a difference on the distribution of revenues from health products stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy arises after Sainsbury's three years have sold its pharmaceutical business with 281 points of sale to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds.
It was said by the company that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding in four shops an extended range of luxury brands for skin care such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, sales director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance and essence of our cosmetics sections to provide our customers with a more pleasant environment.
We also invest in the specialized training of colleagues, who will be available to advise the customer.
Our brand range has been designed to adapt to all needs. On the other hand, the inviting environment and practical locations make us now an irresistible point of sale of beauty products that breaks with the old ways of making purchases."
Peter Jones "hot" after Holly Willoughby left business of 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, became "urgent" after the TV performer Holly Willoughby had left a business of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for the home brand and True accessories.
The business of both had been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning's presenter, 37 years old, announced in Instagram that she would abandon the partnership.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragons Den Peter Jones alive by leaving the lucrative mark in the last minute to focus on his new highly profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources say that Jones was "urgent" when the gold girl of TV admitted, during a tense meeting last Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new business (the value of which may amount to 1.5 million pounds) meant that he would no longer have time to dedicate himself to his brand of household articles and accessories True.
The business was compared to Gwynet Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37 years old, announced on Instagram that he was going to leave True, Jones caught a plane for one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said, "Truly was far from Holly's priorities.
It would mean the resolution of its future in the long term and would be financial support for the next two decades.
Your decision to leave left everyone absolutely scared.
No one believed what was going on on Tuesday... was so close to the launch.
There is a store full of items ready to sell at headquarters in Marlow."
Experts believe that this morning's presentation, which is among Britain's most profitable vedets, can cost millions to the company, given the advanced investment in products, which go from pillows and candles to clothing and articles for home, and the potential for additional delays in the launch.
Moreover, it can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, with three children, and husband Dan Baldwin, are close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp ten years ago.
Willoughby created True with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined the project as president in March.
Couples take vacations together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is about to become a brand ambassador to the M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the I'm The Celebrity of ITV.
A source near Jones said last night that "We do not intend to comment on your business".
Hard conversation "and then we fall in love"
The President of the United States said that he was jokingly criticizing the media for making a comment that some would consider "indecent of a president" and for revealing such a positive attitude with the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in?
Trump said, in his fake voice of "telejournal pivo".
"I didn't give up on anything."
He said that Kim was interested in a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, stressing that it would be a major step in the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the negotiations for denuclearisation are dragging.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders in the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a "corresponding" response from the US to the first steps towards the disarmament of North Korea.
Instead, he said, the United States continues with sanctions for maintaining pressure.
Trump adopted a more optimistic point of view in his speech at the commission.
"It's running very well with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to go into war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have this excellent relationship."
Trump stated that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim led to positive results: the end of the fire tests, support for the release of hostages and the return to the country of the mortal remains of US soldiers.
In addition, he defended his innocuous approach when he spoke in his relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be worthy of a president, but instead of we're 10,000 people out there trying to get into this overloaded arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of them.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia cause devastation on an island, causing the death of hundreds of people
In the heat of the Lombok earthquake, for example, it was told foreign non-governmental organizations that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok population had been displaced, a national disaster, a prerequisite for the channelling of international aid, was not declared.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been clear to say that they are not asking for international assistance; therefore, it becomes a little difficult," said Mrs Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is organizing a team to head to Palu, there is still no guarantee that foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster response agency, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palau to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Despite the constant earthquakes suffered by Indonesia, the country remains terribly ill prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although they have been built in Aceh, shelters against tsunamis are not formally seen on other coastlines.
It is likely that the apparent lack of a series of tsunami alarms in Palu, a bad degree of the validity of a warning, had contributed to the loss of life.
In the most favorable times, traveling between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship parked in Lombok to deal with the victims of earthquakes is on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of this new disaster.
President Joko Widodo, who did the improvement of the infrastructure decodes a central part of his campaign, spent enormous amounts on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding appealed to Mr Joko's executive, at a time when he faced his re-election in the coming year.
The president is also being pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
Over 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were evicted as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using catanas, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
View: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool makes a long finish for the Chelsea zipper
Daniel Sturridge saved a Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League against Chelsea, with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at the Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 metres from Chelsea's luggage, with his team losing for 1-0.
He gave a touch to his left before making a finish towards the second beam.
In the attempt, the ball flew high over the large area by heading to the top right corner of the network.
In the end, the ball fell on a Kepa Arizabalaga flight and fell inside the network.
"I was just trying to reach this position, to go to the ball, and players like Shaq are making as much progress as possible, so I was just getting as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw the Kante coming, I gave a touch, and I didn't think too much of it, I just finished."
Chelsea won 1-0 at the interval after scored a goal in the 25th minute, from the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In this game, the advance of the blues gave a step back to Mateo Kovacic before unmarking near the midfield and performing a sprint towards the Liverpool area.
Kovacic made a quick midfield pass.
Then he completed a beautiful finish that passed through the opposite defense, leading Hazard to the great area.
He crossed the defenses and scored the target against the second beam network with a left foot end that passed through the Alsson Becker's Liverpool network guard.
Liverpool faces Naples in the group phase of the Champions League at three o'clock on Wednesday afternoon at the St. Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at the UEFA's European League at three o'clock on Thursday afternoon in London.
Number of deaths in the tsunami in Indonesia goes up to 832
The number of deaths in the earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster response agency declared early Sunday.
There are reports that describe a large number of people imprisoned in the ruins of buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday, which triggered waves that reached the 6 meters high, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman of the agency, said in a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the ruins of the buildings that had collapsed.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man for suspected murder after a woman's disappearance to death
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The victim, 44 years old, was found at 7:55 in the morning with stabbing wounds in Grayson Mews, John Street, having a 32-year-old man arrested for suspected murder.
The police urged the population of the area that could have witnessed something to give information.

I also want to appeal to those who may have obtained pictures with board cameras, particularly taxi drivers, that contact us, because they may have crucial information for the investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was resident in Birkenhead and was located within a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe to know the victim went to the event site to investigate where she had been found this morning.
The investigations are underway, and the police mentioned that they are currently reporting to relatives close to the victim.

Parliament's Cromwell statue has become the most recent monument swallowed up by the content of "historic revisionism"
Their removal would constitute an act of poetic justice for their destruction, which recalls the permanence of the Taliban, of so many English cultural and religious artifacts, and which was carried out by their fanatical Puritan followers.
However, Cromwell Society described Crick's suggestion as "a crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that in the current debate on the removal of statues, Oliver Cromwell's figure next to the Palace of Westminster would become a target to be defeated.
The iconoclasty of the English civil wars was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed by the acts of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's author, is a testimony to the opinion of the 19th century and from the history of a figure that many still believe to be worthy of honor.
Goldsmith said to Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is faced by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course, of the monarchy.
Whether or not this is a precise description is the subject of a continuing historical debate.
What is true is that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and that Cromwell is a figure with individual notoriety that represents one side of this division.
Your success as Lord Protector is also worthy of homage and commemoration."
Pig Killer Attacks and Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his name "Yuan", was found dead, with a cut artery and covered with blood, close to a stick on the market in Liapanshui, in the province of Guizhou, read in the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
The pig breeder prepares to inject pig vaccines in a pig breed on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai province, China.
According to reports, you will have traveled with the cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
On the next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered a door for a nearby neighbor.
In that pouch, I said, there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, with 227 pounds, had attacked the pig farmer until death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were covered with blood and mutilated," said the cousin, referred to by his name "Wu," according to Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man doesn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been closed to avoid attacking other people while the police collected evidence at the scene.
Reports say that the Yuan family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for their death.
Although rare, cases of swine attacks have already been reported to human beings.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on her fifth in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig immobilized a Welsh farm against its tractor until the woman managed to scare the animal.
After an Oregon farmer had been eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the smell of blood can work as "stimulation".
"They're just playing.
They like to lick, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
We only need to show them due respect," he said.
Risks of the pink hurricane should bring widespread heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
As expected, the pink hurricane is weakening as it moves on the coldest waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, it will bring torrential rains to the whole Mexican north and to the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
At 5 a.m., Eastern Time on Sunday, Rosa was driven 137 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
However, it begins to form a depression on the Pacific Ocean that moves to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the peninsula of Baja California, Rosa, now a tropical storm, will begin to push a strong tropical humidity towards the north in the south-west of the United States.
On Monday, it will cause precipitation that can reach 25 mm in certain areas of Mexico.
At that time, tropical humidity interacting with the approaching depression will produce strong widespread rains in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 mm of rain may cause dangerous sudden floods, damage caused and possibly land-based food in the desert.
The strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation that can reach 5 to 7 mm in point areas, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 mm of precipitation were expected in Southeast areas, especially on much of Arizona.
Sudden floods with rapid worsening conditions are possible due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It is highly advisable to walk in the desert walking with the threat of tropical rains.
The strong precipitation can make the sliders turn into brave rivers and the findings will bring strong point winds and dust clouds.
The approaching depression will bring with it strong precipitation on parts of the southern coast of California.
Total precipitations of more than 12 mm are possible, which may cause small ingestions of fatalities and sloping roads.
This may be the first precipitation of the wet station in the region.
There will begin to be some tropical waters dispersed in Arizona at the end of Sunday and at the beginning of Monday, before the rain becomes more dispersed at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
The strong rain will spread in the Four Corners on Tuesday and will last until the fourth.
October can record strong temperature changes throughout the U.S. territory as the Arctic cools down. However, tropical areas will remain quite fine.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes in short distances.
There is an excellent example of the drastic temperature differences across the U.S. central area on Sunday.
There is a difference of almost 11 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the constant summer heat will tend to increase and expand again.
It is expected that much of the central and eastern U.S. area will start in October, with temperatures ranging from 27 to 30 degrees from the South Plains to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York can reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures above the average in the eastern United States until the end of the first half of October.
More than 20 million people attended Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people attended six television stations yesterday to Brett Kavanaugh's rapt witness, appointed to the Supreme Court, and of the woman who accused him of alleged sexual abuse in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
However, the political impasse continued, with the stations interrupting regular programming due to a recent turnaround: an agreement drawn up by the Senator of Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Commission that he had absolute confidence that Kavanaugh had beaten her while drunk and tried to kick her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an inflamed testimony, said he was absolutely certain that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, numbered by Nielsen on Friday, attended the hearing.
The company recorded the average number of viewers in the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC chains.
The numbers of the other stations that transmitted it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring hearings of those who see programs in offices.
To give some perspective, this is a level of hearings similar to the end of an American football game or the Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators gave their strong support to the appointment of Kavanaugh, led all television stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing that lasted all day, referred to Nielsen.
The ABC was in second place with 3.26 million spectators.
Next came CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, referred to Nielsen.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of the Friday drama.
After the cabinet of the moderate Republican had issued a statement stating that his vote would be in favour of Kavanaugh, the senator was arrested by the CNN and CBS Chambers on Friday morning to be verbally attacked by protesters when he tried to enter a lift to attend a hearing of the Judicial Commission.
The senator remained motionless to look at the floor while he was directly criticized for the CNN cameras.
"I'm here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told that "you have power while so many women have no power."
Flake stated that his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, that he would have more to say in the hearing of the committee.
The cable and broadcasting stations were all covering the event in direct hours later, when the Judicial Commission voted to make Kavanaugh's appointment continue for a plenary session of the Senate.
However, Flake stated that he would only do so in the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee during the next week, which the democratic minority had been demanding.
Flake was partly convinced after talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and then with some other senators, he made his decision.
Flake's choice was decisive, since it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an investigation by the FBI into allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of "making politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of his plans to abandon the European Union of "making political" with the future of Britain and of damaging national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, British Prime Minister, arrived at the Conservatory Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with him on the first page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on what is known as the "Checkers Plan" of the Minister for Brexit, stating that a proposal that provides for Britain and the EU to cover the tariffs of the other party is "totally absurd".
Homicide by Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Diteon Simpson of the LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect of Sims's death shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and charged with murder in second degree, according to a communication from the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities released a video of the match between Sims and Simpson, with the police claiming that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered them at the scene and declared that they had found Simpson's DNA, told WAFB, a CBS subsidiary.
After questioning Simpson, the police reported that he had killed Wayde with a firearm.
A loan of USD 350 000 was established, the lawyer said.
The medical-legal office of the Parish of East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a bullet wound in the head extending to the neck.
The department reports that the collaboration of the action group of the State Police of Louisiana, the criminal lab of the state police, the South University police and residents of the area who cooperated in the investigation led to this arrest.
The athletic director of the LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the authorities in the area for their "diligence and effort to obtain justice".
Yeah, he was 20 years old.
This advanced 1,98 m high grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Its average was 5.6 points and 2.6 highlights per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "damaged" and "in shock" for the death of Wayde.
"That's what we're worried about forever," Wade said.
Volcano throws ashes into Mexico City
Emanating ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention advised Mexicans on Sunday to stay away from the volcano after a resumption of activity on the crater, which recorded 183 gas and ashes emissions in a 24-hour space.
The center has detected numerous loud and trembling noises.
Images on the social networks showed fine layers of ashes covering the car lights in neighborhoods of the City of Mexico as Jochimilco.
The geophysicists recorded an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 72 kilometres from the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit the central area of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Comparisons between the Catalan police and separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between independent protesters and the intervention police, while thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizer referring to catalon on the recession.
A group of masked separatists, framed by the intervention police, touched her with eggs and threw ink into the dust, creating dark dust clouds in the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
There were also later confrontations, in which the police used the batons to contain the conflicts.
For a few hours, independent groups singing "Don't forget, Don't forgive" faced unionist protesters, who shouted "Long Life for Spain".
Fourteen people have received treatment for minor injuries suffered in protests, can be read in the local press.
The tensions remain high in the region inclined to independence, one year after the reference of October 1 which was considered illegal by Madrid, but which was celebrated by the Catalan separatists.
The electorate chose the independence overwhelmingly, although the fluctuation to the urns had been low, with a majority boycott of those against.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police had tried to block the current vote on voting tables scattered by the region, resulting in violent confrontations.
Independent groups had camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for the national police.
Although this event had been performed, it was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68 years old, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped that Catalonia would become independent.
"Last year, we live our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy for being able to vote, but now we are blocked," he said.
Despite having won a vital but tangential victory in the regional elections in December last, the Catalan independent parties have had difficulty maintaining the momentum this year, with their most known leaders in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police with her cell phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting tighter and tighter," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been waiting for trial since last year, announced that he would apply to the European Parliament in the elections next year.
"Presenting me as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we see on the part of the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after car crash against a house
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after a car had been hit repeatedly in a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m., British summer hour.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings claimed that damage occurred in the gates and in the building itself.
At some point, someone may also have shot an animal against the car.
Menga attack gives a victory of 1-0 to Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston assured the victory
Livingston, promoted to the first division, scared the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the second defeat of only two in 18 games as a technique of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's attack made the difference, at a time when Gary Holt's team changes level, with the Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team, which continues without a win out of the house in the first division this season, faces Hearts leaders, with eight more points, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will face Rapid Vienna at the European League on Thursday at home.
However, Livingston has expanded its succession of undefeated confrontations in the division to six games, with the main coach Holt without losing a single time since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against disturbed visitors
Holt's team should have gone ahead in the marker long before the goal, because the incisive character of their game was causing all kinds of problems to Rangers.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but he let himself be dragged in front of the ballistics and then Alan Lithgow managed only to direct his efforts far away after he had slipped to find Craig Halkett's head on the ballistics.
The house team was pleased to let the Rangers play in front of her, knowing that she could cause trouble to visitors in the ball games.
And that's how the crucial goal came up.
The Rangers granted a free and Livingston got an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated to take the pass to Menga, which gave a touch and marked from the center of the big area.
At this point, Rangers dominated the ball's possession, but he faced a defense from the team of the impenetrable house, and Liam Kelly's network guard had no big problems.
This pattern continued in the second part, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend himself.
Scott Pittman was frustrated by the Rangers' network guard's feet, Allan McGregor, and Lithgow gave a play away from another liveston stand ball.
They continued to come across crossings to the large area of Livingston, which were subsequently resolved, and two claims of great criminality, one after Halkett's investment in the Glenn Middleton substitute and one after the other, were rejected by the arbitrator.
Livingstone Phenomenal Analysis
Alasdair Lamont, from the BBC Scotland, to Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception, continuing to exceed expectations in this ascending path.
Their game style and staff have changed little since their return to the big teams, but it is necessary to praise Holt for the way he galvanized the eleven since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was enormous, achieving an extremely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall giving their best throughout the game.
Anyway, Rangers revealed little inspiration.
Despite the excellent quality shown sometimes with Gerrard, the team was very close to these standards.
Their final play was not inspired (only once they were able to open the house team), constituting a kind of warning for Rangers, which is located in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is ambiguably received in Cologne
There were smiles under a blue sky on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for a breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, whose aim was to repair relations between NATO allies.
The difference involved issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan then headed for the Colony to launch a new and giant mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside its country.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of more than 25 000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters marked the presence in the immediate vicinity to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurdish, were also heard, condemning both the president's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The antagonistic protests reflect the divisionist character of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the crossing of Beswood Street with Evelyn Street, a street moving to Deptford, in the west of the city, near 10 a.m., British summer hour.
The driver of the trip stopped and an intervention relief team, but the cyclist died at the scene.
This collision occurs months after the death of another cyclist in a collision with an escape on Children Street, about a mile and a half from the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the agents are trying to identify the person and inform his family.
Barriers and deviations were placed for buses, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six agents injured in disorders
Six prison officials were injured in disturbances in a male high-security prison, the Prison Office said.
The continuing disturbances began at the HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire about 0930, British summer hour on Saturday.
Special agents were called "Tornado" to solve the problem, which involves eight prisoners and is restricted to a wing.
The agents received treatment for minor facial injuries at the site.
A spokesperson for the Prison Services said: "Specially trained teams have been used to resolve the current incident in the HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it must be made clear that the names of those responsible will be communicated to the police and that they will spend more time behind the ranks."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, agents from the intervention police were called to resolve a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (the areas affected by the drought can benefit)
It is rare to experience tropical depression reaching Arizona, but it is exactly what is planned for the beginning of next week, when the remaining energy of the pink hurricane passes through the Southeast Desert, implying the risk of sudden floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued a sudden flood notices for Monday and Tuesday, for the south and east areas of Nevada, for southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route on Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the end of Monday with rain.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix reported on a tweet that only "ten tropical cycles have maintained a state of tropical storm or depression in a radius of 300 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 60 km from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre provide 5 to 10 mm of precipitation, with isolated quantities that can reach the 15 mm in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the South-East Desert, such as the Central Rock Mountains and the Great Bacia, can receive 3 to 5 mm, with the possibility of all isolated ones that can reach 10 mm.
For those not affected by the risks of sudden floods, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is affected by the drought.
Although floods are a very serious concern, part of this precipitation can be beneficial, because the southwest is currently being affected by the drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, little more than 40% of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second most serious category," weather.com reported.
First of all, the Rosa hurricane will reach the continental mass through the peninsula of Baja California, Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with winds at a maximum speed of 137 km/h, is 619 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it is weakening.
Thus, it is expected to reach the coastal area in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or when it falls from the night of Monday.
There may be strong precipitation in parts of Mexico, which creates a significant risk of floods.
"Total precipitation is expected from 8 to 10 mm from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with a maximum of 25 mm possible," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north, crossing Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the first hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. It will then head south of Utah in the last hours of Tuesday night.
"The main expected danger of Rosa or her resources is the very high precipitation in Baja California, in the northwest of Sonora, and in the southwest of the U.S. Desert," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to produce sudden and inundated floods of destruction in the desert, with life-threatening, and food in mountainous lands.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage men and a 20-year-old man were arrested for murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stabbing wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of the Excelsior Terrace of Midsomer Norton, near 4h00, British summer hour on Saturday.
It was transported to the hospital, where it remains "stable".
During the night a 17-year-old teenager, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area, reported Avon and Somerset police.
The agents called on everyone who could have cell phone footage of the incident.
Trump claimed that Kavanaugh "was the victim of evil and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the implacable and extravagant tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in a commission in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump reported that Kavanaugh "was the victim of evil and anger" of the Democratic Party during its nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before the Congress on Thursday, having vigorously and emotionally denied a charge by Christine Blasey Ford that she had sexually abused her for decades when both were teenagers.
Ford also testified in the hearing about his claim.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people witnessed the brilliantism, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a brilliant public service curriculum," said a crowd of Western Virginia supporters.
The President referred later to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of republican influence on the polls in the inter-Calaar elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not competing, but I'm actually competing," he said.
"That's why I went all over the place fighting for excellent candidates."
Trump argued that the democrats are in a mission of "resistance and obstruction.
The first procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is scheduled to take place by Friday at the latest, CNN said a major deputy of the Republican Party leadership.
Hundreds of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia; the number continues to rise
At least 384 people died, many of those dragged by the giant waves that hit the beaches, when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves with up to six meters high had hit the beach late, dragging many to death and causing a trail of devastation on their way.
The tsunami occurred as a result of a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the threat of tsunamis arose yesterday, people were still in their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, having been victims of the incident," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman for reducing the impact of Indonesia's (BNPB) disasters in a Jacarta communication.
"The tsunami didn't move alone: it pulled cars, trunks, houses, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved into the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before reaching the shoreline.
Some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, deformed and demolished bridges, and a watered mosque.
The coastal city continued to be rocked by replicas on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesia Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) reported in a statement that the energy released by the massive Friday avalanche was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb released on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city's geography, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have amplified the size of the tsunami, read in the statement.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
They found bodies of some victims imprisoned under the debris of the ruined buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho reported that the number of victims and damage can be deeper along the coast line 300 km north of Palu, an area named Dongala, closer to the earthquake epicenter.
The communications "were completely incapacitated and there was no information" about Dongala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 inhabitants in the area," said the Red Cross in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities claimed that the waves had arisen at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur film released on social networks, you can see a man on the top floor of a building shouting frenetic warnings that the tsunami was approaching, for people on the street below.
In a space of minutes, a water wall fell on the coast, dragging buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the filming.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive energy cut that interrupted communications in the Palu area, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo aircraft with the help of Jacarta and other cities. However, the evacuations still desperately need food and other basic products.
The airport of the city was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo made a visit to Palau's evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of deaths in the tsunami in Indonesia increases exponentially to more than 800.
It's very bad.
Although he has managed to reach the city of Palu safely, where the staff are housed in lounge shelters mounted in the courtyard of his offices, the staff of the World Vision of Dongala went through the scenes of devastation on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when the relief groups began to undertake the dark disaster relief tasks, some complained that the highly experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, supplies and foreign personnel may only have access to the place if it is declared "national disaster zone".
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a level of provincial catastrophe," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Red Cross Indonesia.
"When the government says, 'OK, this is a national disaster', we can open the doors to international assistance, but this status still doesn't exist."
When the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and relatives of the still missing continued their hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that mitigated the dark spots of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was removed from an exit.
On Sunday, the relief workers released a woman who had been trapped in the trash for two days next to the mother's body.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of his athletes who disappeared for the Asian Games, completed at the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Other prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior paraglider, I have to carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon said that in the hours after the news of the development of Hotel Roa Roa began to circulate among the paragliding community, he desperately sent messages at WhatsApp to the sportsmen of Palu, who were taking part in the festival on the beach.
However, their messages produced only a grey check mark instead of a pair of blues.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves take 26 750 USD while refueling the automatic box in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's officer who re-supplyed an automatic box at Newport on the Levee, according to a report from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying an automatic box in the fun complex and preparing to introduce more money, says Detective Dennis McCarthy in the communiqué.
While he was busy, another man "striking up behind Brink's officer" and stealing a bag of money for a delivery.
Witnesses saw a number of suspects fleeing the place, according to the report, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Those who have information about their identities should contact the Newport police through number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper renames to Ye
Rapper Kanye West has changed his name--to Ye.
In announcing this change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being previously known by Kanye West".
West, 41 years old, received some time ago by someone from Ye and used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before your participation in Saturday Night Live, where you are expected to present your new Yandhi album.
This intervention is intended to replace that of the Ariana Grande singer, who cancelled it for "emotional reasons", informed the creator of the show.
At the same time as an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word has a religious meaning for him, according to West.
"I think "yes" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West at the beginning of this year, when he commented on the title of his album with the Big Boy radio player.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
It comes from Kanye, which means "the only one", for only Ye - being just a reflection of our good, of our evil, of our confusion, of all things.
The album is another reflection of who we are."
Kanye is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was alternately known by Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference by the names Love and Brother Love.
Former collaborator of West, JAY-Z, also used variations of his name with or without hyphen and capital.
In Mexico, AMLO undertakes not to resort to military action against civilians
Mexican elected president Andres Manuel López Obrador committed himself to not using military force against civilians, at a time when the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "never use the army to suppress the Mexican people".
Military firemen fired a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, resulting in a number of deaths that could have risen to 300 when leftist student movements were deployed throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador committed himself to supporting young Mexicans by granting them monthly grants to those who study and open more public universities.
The president said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. should double the funding of artificial intelligence
At a time when China reinforces its work in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the costs of research in this field, said the investor and professional in the Kai-Fu Lee area, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments occur after several U.S. government departments have made announcements related to IA, even though the country does not have a comprehensive formal strategy on the subject.
However, China presented its plan last year: it aims to lead innovation in IA by 2030.
"Duplicateing the research budget in IA would be a good start, as all the other countries are so behind the US and we are looking for the new revolution in IA," Lee said.
Double funding can double the chances of the next great success of IA being achieved by the United States, Lee referred to NBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a company that invested in one of the most prominent companies of IA in China, a Face++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he worked on an IA system that defeated Othello's best-class American player. Later, he performed executive functions at Microsoft Research and was president of the Google branch in China.
Lee gave credit to previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge of the Department of Defense for Advanced Research Projects Agency and asked when it would be next, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
US researchers often have to make a great effort to obtain state funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that's stealing academic leaders; it's companies," he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired academics from universities to work in IA.
Lee said that changes in immigration policies could also help the US to push its efforts in the field of IA.
"I was of the opinion that green cards should be automatically granted to doctors in IA," he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its Plan for the Development of the Artificial Intelligence of the Next Generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation of Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to that used by the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to fund researchers in the United States. However, the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the United States Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which is intended to involve partners in industry and the academic environment, and the White House announced the formation of the Constraint Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month an investment of $2 billion in an initiative designated by AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it currently invests more than USD 100 million per year in IA research.
However, U.S. legislation that was intended to set up a National Commission of Safety for Artificial Intelligence is not moving forward for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the change of country name
The Macedonians voted on Sunday to decide on the change of the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", an initiative that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that blocked its applications for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes a province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim on its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposal for a new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would be a blow to the ethnic identity of the Macedonian population, mostly slaves.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the fluctuation in the polls would be sufficient to meet the 50% required for the referendum to be valid.
The rapporteur's question was, "Is it in favour of entering NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to continue the admission efforts with EU and NATO to Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am coming today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people in Macedonia, so that they can live free under the auspices of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament said that it would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The national electoral committee stated that there had been no record of irregularities until one afternoon.
However, the fluctuation was only 16%, compared with 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of the registered voters appeared to vote.
"I will vote for my children; our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a capital voter, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in the referendum on the change of country name, which would open the doors for their accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumika, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents mounted by whom they would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and for the EU, but we want to join with our heads up and not the door of service," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to receive us as Macedonia, we can address others as China and Russia to become part of the eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO entry would bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, which accounts for over 20% of the unemployment rate.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after giving his vote.
According to him, a "yes" would be the "confirmation of our future".
A poll published on Monday by the Political Research Institute of Macedonia revealed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a value lower than the required fluctuation.
Another survey, conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, found that 57% of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote.
For the success of the referendum, the fluctuation must be more than 50% more than one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first major desirability in the policy of the pro-Western government since it took possession in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero do Manchester City across the entire Brighton defense towards the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling forgot to defend Brighton in the 2-0 victory against Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
I'm going to make it look ridiculously easy on your goal in 65 minutes.
The Argentine advanced received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the play.
He made a sprint between three Brighton defenses before cutting to reach an open field.
He was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He made a defense before neutralizing others in the race within the borders of the large area of Brighton.
Then he took a walk to his left, where Sterling was.
The advanced English used its first touch in the big area to return the ball to Aguero, who, with the right boot, defeated Brighton Mathew Ryan's network guard with a finish on the right side of the network.
"Aguero is arguing about some of the problems on his feet," said journalist Pep Guardiola, city coach.
"We spoke of him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage over the Premier League.
That goal was marked at the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball well in Brighton's territory in that play.
He took a walk on the defenses along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
This gave some touch before driving Sterling towards the second track.
The advance Sky Blues hit the ball to the network immediately before sliding out of the field.
The city faces Hoffenheim in the group phase of the Champions League at 12:55 a.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make life difficult for Rockies
With the Nationals removed from the end, there were not many reasons to force another start.
However, the ever competitive Scherzer has hopes to enter the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications for the final Rockies, which hold a leadership of a game about the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies were at least lucky with a victory of 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still intend to secure their title for the first division.
"Although we're playing for nothing, at least we can get into the field knowing that the environment here in Denver, with the crowd, the other team will probably play at the highest level I could face this year.
Why would I not want to compete in these conditions?"
The Nationals have not yet announced the launcher for Sunday, but some say that they are inclined to allow Scherzer to carry out the launches in this situation.
Scherzer, who would hold his 34th beginning, took a bullpen session on Thursday and would throw in his normal position on Sunday.
Washington's right player goes with 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts at 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump makes a commission in West Virginia
The President referred later to the situation involving his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he mentioned the importance of republican influence in the inter-Calaar elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not competing, but I'm competing and that's why I'm everywhere fighting for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You're seeing this horrible, horrible group of radical democrats, you're seeing it happening right now.
And they're determined to recover power using all the necessary means.
They don't care who they're angry with, who they have to go over to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give them."
The Democrats, he said, have the task of "resisting and obstructing".
"And they've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling it "aggressive, evil, deaf and lying" to the democrats.
The president referred to the name of Diane Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judicial Committee, and received loud audience voices.
"Do you remember your answer?
Did you run the document?
Whoa, whoa, what?
No, um, no, I, wait, one - that was a really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party has stopped being involved.
It is intolerant to those who openly give their opinion
When the activists at the Momentum of my local party organisation voted to censor me, it was not a surprise to me.
Finally, I am the most recent of a number of Members of Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome - all because we openly express our views.
My colleague in the Joan Ryan Parliament was the target of a similar treatment because he resolutely faced anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues concerning which Jeremy disagreeed with previous leaders.
The notification to the Nottingham East working party at the sixth fair mentioned that "we claim that the meetings are inclusive and productive".
During most of my eight years as a local Labour Representative in Parliament, the meetings of the General Committee were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today, it has ceased to be the tone of many of the meetings and the political promise "most kind and kind" has been forgotten, if it has ever come true.
It has become increasingly apparent that the different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that each opinion is judged whether or not it is acceptable by the party's leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy took the lead, as colleagues who thought he shared a similar political perspective began to expect me to turn around and assume positions that he would never agree with - either on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public (and it doesn't really matter what I say), there is a torrent of insults on the social networks that call for "renunciation", reporting the policies of the centre, saying that I should not belong to the Labour Party.
And it's not just me who's going through this.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments I have addressed tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of these colleagues who face a barricade of sexual or racist insults every day, but who never go back to them.
One of the most disappointing aspects in this era of politics is how these levels of insult have become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we have stopped being involved, and with each motion of "censorship" or change of the selection rules the party narrows its views.
I've received a lot of advice over the last two years, urging me to keep my head down so that it won't be so expressive, and that's how "it's gonna be okay" for me.
But that's not why I came to make politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, driven by the neglect of thatcher's government that left the classroom of my literally covering school in trash, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need them most, either as autarch or as a minister in the government.
I have never hidden my policies, including in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I have to say is that when the country goes to a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the message I have is not for Nottingham's moment; it is for my constituents, members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of "dissentment" or political files will prevent me from acting in the sense that I believe it is the interests of all of you.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: the Unbeatable Air goes to the top
Two late tests somehow sent the result, but there is no doubt that Air deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting Tennent's Premiership game of the day.
The team is now at the top of the table, the only one of ten without defeats.
In the end, it was a superior defense and better risk management that made the house team take the best, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in our games so far and still unbeatable, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "The merit goes to Air. They better manage the risks than we do."
Grant Anderson's trial in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Air in the front, but a yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who surrendered to the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to express the numbers, having Jason Baggot benefited from an unconverted test.
Climate extended the advantage of Air with a great penalty, before, immediately before the half-time, had marked and then converted a soil test to place the marker on 17-5 to Air at the interval.
However, Melrose well started the second part and Patrick Anderson's test, converted by Baggot, reduced the disadvantage to five points.
There was a long interruption due to a serious injury from Ruarid Knott, which was transported from maca to the outside and, after the restart, Air reinforced leadership with a Stafford McDowall test converted by Climo.
Air's captain, Blair Macpherson, then received a yellow card and, once again, Melrose took advantage of the numerical advantage with a non-converted trial from Bruce Colvine at the end of an intense investment in pressure.
However, the house team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card because he had destroyed Climus without the ball in the release of the penalty, MacPherson placed the ball on the floor behind the ground in Air's progress.
The climate turned, as it had done almost immediately following the reinstatement, after Kyle Rowe had picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth trial of the house team.
Still Game Star ready for a new career in the restoration business
Ford Kieran, a Still Game star, seems ready to enter the restoration sector after knowing that he was appointed director of a licensed restoration company.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, who writes and participates with the long-term comedian partner Greg Hemfill.
The couple announced that the ninth season, staring soon, will be the last of the series, and it seems Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is Director of Arifingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan was trying to get involved in the "flowering business of the Glasgow restoration".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, a land without a coast, expects the court to restore a path to the Pacific
Marines patrol a wire-covered naval base in La Paz.
Public buildings bear a blue-sea flag.
The ship bases of Lake Titicaca for the Amazon bear the motto: "The sea is our right.
To recover it is a duty."
Throughout Bolivia, a landlocked country, there is still the memory of a lost coastal line for Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict, as well as the desire to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be at the highest point of the decades, since Bolivia is awaiting a ruling from the International Court of Justice on 1 October, after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the impetus, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, a positive perspective on the result," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will assist in the delivery of the TIJ ruling on giant screens scattered by the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will resolve in favour of its country's claim, so that, after decades of uncertain negotiations, Chile will be forced to negotiate, granting Bolivia a sovereign sea exit.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election in the coming year, is also very at stake in the Monday judgment.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," the President's votes were last August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will do so in favour of Bolivia, and that it would not change much in the other case.
The United Nations body, based in the Netherlands, has no power to assign Chilean territory to another country and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the TIJ ruling should be issued only six months after the hearing of the final allegations indicates that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have damaged it.
"The issue of access to the sea was kidnapped by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
The belligerent rhetoric of Morales undermined some Chilean residual good will, he suggested.
At a future time, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain the dialogue after this.
The two countries have not changed ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a representative of Bolivia in Haia, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process was inadvertently fast.
The next Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a possibility of "put an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, another of the most popular presidents in Latin America, was using the maritime issue as a political mule.
"Bolivia will never relinquish its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to understand that we have to go beyond the past."
North Korea says there will be no disarmament without the country's trust in the US
The Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, said his nation would never give up its nuclear weapons if it didn't trust Washington first.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
In his speech, he urged the United States to fulfill the promises they made at a summit in Singapore among the leaders of rival countries.
His comments arise when US Secretary of State Mike Pompey appears to be ready to resume nuclear diplomacy in impasse, more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said that this is an "impossible dream" to consider that the United States' continued sanctions and objections to a declaration that puts an end to the Korean war will sometimes lead the North to kneel down.
Washington was afraid to accept the statement without Pyongyang giving significant first steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is a generalised cyticism about Pyongyang actually intends to reduce an arsenal that the country is still probably the only way to ensure its safety.
Pumpeo plans to visit Pyongyang in the month that comes to prepare a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the most recent line of huge hats on the way to a store near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, you don't need to seek any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of extravagance and oversized hats on the pass for their spring-summer 2019 collections, which left the style set in Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram was flooded with very little practical hats and these designers sent these amazing creations to pass it.
Valentino's most prominent piece was an extravagant hat beige decorated with a wide abbey similar to a torment that flooded the head of the models.
Other oversized accessories included nailed melons of jewelry, a witch hat and even a pineapple, although they were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks... even at the time of the carnival.
Many of the colored masks had cooked lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than with high sewing.
One of the creations resembled the dive equipment, with tubes and glasses, while the other looked like a melted iceberg.
And if you want to continue this huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Stylism observers predict that these huge hats are on the way to a store near you.
Oversized hats appear effervescent on the path of La Bomba, the straw hat with a 61 cm abbe that has been used by all people, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the very little practical hat that spread through the social networks sent another great creation for the passageways: a beach bag in straw almost as large as the model in the bathroom that carried it.
The roasted orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringes and with a white leather stick, was the most prominent piece of the spring-summer collection La Riviera 2019 by Jacquemus in Paris Fashion Week.
The famous Stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I am looking forward to seeing large hats and beach bags coming to the shops for the next summer. Since the designer had so much impact, it would be difficult to ignore the search for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
The independent schools of Scotland benefit from a curriculum of academic excellence, with this trend continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results in the exams, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students scattered throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strive to obtain the best level of service for both students and parents.
Independent schools intend to prepare their students for the deepening of their studies and access to universities, as well as for the career they have chosen and to take their place as global citizens.
Since this is an educational sector capable of designing and implementing a school curriculum to the extent possible, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular theme and sought out in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If we speak to a man in a language he understands, we can enter his mind.
If we speak to him in his own language, we can enter into his heart."
This quote reminds us that we cannot depend only on English when we intend to create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of this year's recent exams, we have verified that languages are at the top of the tables, with the highest rates of use of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages reached the maximum classification of A.
This data, collected in 74 schools under the scope of the SCIS, shows that 72% of the students obtained the maximum grade of A in mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This shows that Scottish independent schools are promoting foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly serve children and young people in the future.
The languages, as an option, are now dealt with in the same way as the STEM themes (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and not only.
A UK Employment and Competence Commission survey in 2014 concluded that, among the reasons for the difficulty of employers to fill gaps, 17% referred to the lack of language skills.
Therefore, knowing other languages is increasingly an imperative to prepare the young generation for their future careers.
With more potential employment opportunities to demand language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of your chosen career, if you have learned a second language, you will have a tangible advantage in the future with a skill for life like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person in front of competition.
According to a survey of YouTube to over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, and the French is the only language spoken by a two-digit ratio, 15%.
Therefore, investing now in language teaching is important for today's children.
The domain of several languages, particularly those in developing countries, will give children with better chances of finding employment with relevance.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Some of them will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages considered the most important for the United Kingdom for the 2020 horizon, such as mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a set of languages to choose from in independent schools, supported by teaching staff specialized in the area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a pedagogical environment that prepares children and gives them the skills necessary for success, whatever the future holds for them.
Today, in a globalised business environment, languages continue to be of fundamental importance to the future of the country.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this option with diversity and excellence for young Scottish people.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron starts at Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is ending for the fans who want to see LeBron James begin at Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, announced that James will participate in the opening game on Sunday's pre-emption against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes will play yet to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Laker journalist Mike Trudell published a tweet saying James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After the trainings at the beginning of this week, James was questioned about his plans for the six Lakers games calendar in the pre-temporary.
"I don't need pre-temporary games at this stage of my career to be ready," he said.
Time and channel of YouTube from Trump Commission in West Virginia
President Donald Trump starts a campaign round tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five commissions scheduled for next week, which include stops in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of compliance pending for your election to the Supreme Court, Trump seeks to strengthen support for the inter-state elections to be held soon, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump's start in West Virginia tonight and how do you see it online?
The start of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, is marked for 7 p.m., Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's commission in West Virginia online below on live YouTube.
Trump will probably address this week's hearings to Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, who have become tense due to allegations of sexual abuse. The vote of confirmation envisaged in the Senate will remain pending for a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
However, the main objective of this commission stream is to help Republicans, who face difficult elections in November, to gain some impetus.
Thus, those responsible for President Trump's campaign would say that these five commissions will "give energy to volunteers and supporters at a time when Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority that they maintain in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congression control is so fundamental to the president's agenda that he will visit as many states as possible as we approach the agitation of the campaign season," said a spokesman for Trump's campaign that he gave up being quoted, told Reuters.
Marked for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the start of the night can attract supporters "from Ohio to Pennsylvania and get coverage of the media in the Pittsburgh area", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time this month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate to the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, undermining the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to help him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team shows that it has the strength to fight to keep hope alive before the Sunday singles
After three uniform sessions, Saturday throughsomes in the afternoon may be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum oscillation of the impement is a completely invented sport concept, but it is one in which players truly believe, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where would they say the impetus will come now?
"They have an advantage of six points and now there are four, so we are dealing with this as a bit of impetuous," said Jordan Spieth as he was leaving the field at the end of the day.
Europe is, of course, in favour of four points ahead and 12 more at stake.
Americans, as Spieth says, still have some reserve energy and many reasons to feel encouraged, especially given the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them achieved three points in four.
Spieth has been a mortal of tea to green and is leading by example.
Those festive guitar screams were becoming higher as the round continued, with a crucial putt that made from the fourth round an all-square when he and Thomas were two holes behind in two.
His putt that won the match on the 15th produced a similar scream, from that guy who reveals that he still believes that the American team continues to compete.
"We just need to focus and worry about our own game," Spieth said.
That's all that's left to each of these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable revelation of Ryder Cup.
The European couple, which is unlikely but adorable, is four in four and cannot be mistaken.
The "Moliwood" was the only duet not to make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back Sunday morning.
In this series, and given the way their energy seems to flow from and to this turbulent crowd, the idea that they are the players to beat on Sundays is reinforced, and that there is no more popular player to seal a European potential victory in the Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably, both at the same time in different holes.
However, the speech on the glory of Europe remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourballs this morning, when teamed with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front of the nanny put Spanish and Swedish in a hole that they've never been close to getting out.
However, on Sunday, there is no one to help them get out of him.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see from close because of interactions between partners, advice they give or not and how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played a better team so far and has gained a significant advantage on the final day. However, this foursomes session has also shown that the U.S. team has the stomach for the fight that some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe with a 10-6 leadership on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the last day of the Ryder Cup with a faded advantage after leaving the fourballs and foursomes of the Saturday matches with a 10-6 leadership in front of the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari's inspired duet led the load with two victories over a Tiger Woods with difficulties to reach the Le Golf National classification, so far, of four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, fighting to preserve the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an unsuccessful American team in the morning fourballs, winning the 3-1 series.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes with two winnings, but failed to reduce the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points on Sunday's 12th singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points followed when he and Molinari, who received any of "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend are only the only duet to win four points in their four openings in Ryder Cup history.
Having smashed Woods and Patrick Reed into the fourballs, they super-consolidated the advantage, defeating an energyless Woods and American initiator Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself into two games on Saturday, revealed occasional genius accesses, but he's already lost 19 of the games he played in fourballs and foursomes, and seven follow-up.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating by 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the first and third world rankings.
However, on this pleasant day with a light breeze to the southwest of Paris, Europe has not always brought the best.
Jordan Spieth, the winner of three times the main male tournaments, and Justin Thomas defined the reference for Americans with two points on Saturday.
The duet won a courageous 2&1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter from Spain, and later returned to win Poulter and Rory McIlroy for 4&3 in the foursomes, losing both opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history a team has reversed a four-point disadvantage before the singles, although Furyk's team, the title holder, just needs to tap to preserve the trophy.
After two days in the second position, a counter-attack on Sunday seems beyond its possibilities.
North Korea says "don't think" to a unilateral disarmament with no confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions was exacerbating mistrust in the United States and that there was no way of the country unilaterally abandoning its nuclear weapons in these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "significant good-will measures" last year, such as the interruption of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear testing centre and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the US there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there is no way to proceed to our first disarmament."
Although Ri has already reclaimed North Korean complaints known about Washington's resistance to a "failure" approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded as steps are taken, its statements appear to be significant as they do not marginally reject unilateral denuclearization, in contrast with Pyongyang's previous positions.
Ri mentioned a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever held between a US president in exercise and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim committed to working towards the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump offered security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States states that Pyongyang has first to abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to mitigate the severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on "first denuclearization" and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, resisting even the "declaration of the end of the war", said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is an impossible dream for people who don't know anything about us.
However, the problem is that the extension of sanctions is exacerbating our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump which had been mentioned by US leaders in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: "If the party concerned was South Korea and not the USA, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this impasse."
Still, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that guiding North Korean firemen towards the U.S. territory was inevitable after "Mr. President Mau" Trump called Kim "the man of firemen" in a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea in the past year, filled Kim with praise for his courage to take steps in the sense of disarmament, however, having stated that much was still to be done and that sanctions would have to continue until the denuclearization of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a calendar for this, referring to "during two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions should continue to be effective until denuclearisation is complete, final and verifiable."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened the sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to stifle the financing of nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles in North Korea.
Pompey met with Ri on the side of the UN General Assembly and declared after visiting Pyongyang again in the month ahead to prepare a second summit.
Pompey has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, although then North Korea had denounced him for "making demands of gangster.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed itself to dismantle a missile installation and also a nuclear complex if the United States "take appropriate measures".
Pompey claimed that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" they were the security guarantees taken by Trump in Singapore, as well as initiatives to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course that teaches them to refrain enough
A new course at Harvard University this year put all its students to sleep more, an initiative to combat the masquerade culture of studying in "rights" impregnated with caffeine.
One professor concluded that students of this university at the top of the world rankings often had no less idea of the most basic concepts about the care they should have with themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was the author of the course, who believes to be the first of his kind in the United States.
The inspiration for the course arose after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At last, a girl came to me and said, "Why are you just telling me this in the last year of the course?"
The young man said that no one had ever mentioned the importance of sleep, which surprised me," The Telegraph said.
The course, served for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits contribute positively to academic and athletic performance, as well as to improving general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said that the institution decided to introduce the course after concluding that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a section there is an image of a bedroom where students click on coffee cans, curtains, shoes and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and about how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a routine to collect to bed.
In the other section, participants are informed of how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of AVC, depression and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students instantly.
However, we believe that they have the right to know, as we all have the right to know the health effects of the smoking option," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in "direct doing" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students make this a growing problem.
Ensuring that we sleep enough and with quality should be a "secret weapon" of the students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid thickening, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a hunger mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student of physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year in Harvard.
The course opened her eyes and inspired her to encourage the creation of a course for the whole campus, she said.
The next step, according to its expectations, is to ask all postgraduate students to attend a similar study program before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students weigh the use of an alarm for the time to go to bed, as to wake up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: goal of Menga defeats Gerrard's men
Rangers had another access of sadness out of the house when Dolly Menga's attack caused Steven Gerrard's disarmed team to defeat 1-0 at the Livingston Stadium.
Ibrox's team was trying to record their first victory on their way from the 1-0 triumph in St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team ended up indicting Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games, leaving his team eight points behind the decoy Hearts, the leader of the first Scottish division.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first part and the Rangers collective, without inspiration, never seemed to be equal.
With Rangers now coming down to sixth position, Livingston goes up to third, and only behind the Hibernian because of the difference of goals.
And there may be even more problems for Rangers after the Calum Spence line prosecutor has received treatment of a head injury caused by an apparently thrown object from the visitor's area.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team that exceeded Air in the mid-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, for his part, used the same eleven of Livingston who stole a point at Hearts last week, and will have been delighted with the way his well-sweet team suffocated the opponents in each play.
Rangers may have dominated the ball game, but Livingston did more with what he had.
The team could have scored within two minutes, when the first pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's trunk, but the average wasted their big opportunity out.
A long free tap by Keaghan Jacobs went to meet Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow managed only to finish out towards the second track.
Rangers managed to regain control, but hope was greater than belief in their game at the end of the third.
Certainly Alfredo Morelos found that he should have been granted a great penalty at the fourth hour with his collision with Steven Lawless, but Arbitrary Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian appeals.
Rangers reached only two finishes at the first part, but Ibrox Liam Kelly's old gridguard had little to worry about Lassana Coulibaly's head end and Ovie Ejaria's weak end.
Although Livingston's goal at the 34th minute may have been contrary to what was expected of the game's development, it is inevitable that the team deserves it, however much less because of its tenacity.
Once again, Rangers couldn't deal with a long-ahead ball game of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher took a walk to Scott Robinson, who kept calm when he chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard moved in the interval, replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and this exchange almost immediately had an impact when the lateral advance passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly made a sprint from her line to make the lock.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett to take a long walk behind a long walk.
Holt's team may have increased its advantage in the final stages, but McGregor stood up well, defending himself from Jacobs before Lithgow ended up out in the corner.
The Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, once again claimed a great penalty when he emranged himself in Jacobs, but Thomson ignored the request again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of our Almanac "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and continues to CONTAR ...was born in Germany the physical future of Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that led to the device known as Geiger counter.
A fundamental piece of science since then, the counter Geiger has also become a central element of pop culture, as in the 1950's "Bells of Coronado" film in which the unlikely vaqueiro scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals as a uranium.
When we put these ears, we can even hear the effects of atoms released by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Look, now you're really shaking!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention he gave the name still lasts.
New vaccine for cancer teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells
A new vaccine for cancer teaches the immune system to "see" harmful cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and its alteration into the laboratory
These cells, which can "see" a common protein to many cancers, are then injected again into the body
An experimental vaccine is producing promising results in patients with a number of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells, saw her cancer in the ovaries disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and its laboratory alteration so that they can "see" a common protein to many cancers, designated by HER2. These cells are then re-injected into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "controls the growth of various types of cancer", including those of the breast, the ovary, the lungs and also the colorectals, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach involving the removal of patients' immune cells and "teaching them" to attack cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a diagnostic of support for Trump by engravering a MAGA hat after its appearance in the SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West went to the studio on Saturday Night Live after an inconsistent performance in which the President of the United States, Donald Trump, praised him, said that he would apply to the presidential elections in 2020.
After performing his evening song, with the name of Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat "Make America Great", he started a bravado against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"How many times do I talk to a white man and he says to me, "How can you like Trump?
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started with a satire with Matt Damon, where Hollywood star broke Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it had not been transmitted, the scene of West Bravata was published on social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to change West when he did.
In addition, West had complained to the public that a bad bit had happened in the builders because of the hat.
"I was intimidated by the builders.
They said, "Don't go there with that hat."
They intimidated me!
And then they tell me I'm marginalized," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West went on: "Do you want to see the marginalization?", saying that "I wanted my super-man cover, because that means no one tells me what to do.
Try to love."
His comments provoked a wave of public and the participants in the SNL seemed to be ashamed, he told Variety, having someone from the program said to the newspaper: "All the studio was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with the performance of the song I Love it undressed Perrier bottle.
West received a demonstration of support from the director of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who published the tweet: "To one of our bravest spirits: OBSERVED TO FREQUENT THE TURBA".
However, the interview programmer Karen Hunter published a tweet saying that West was simply "to be what it is, and that is absolutely wonderful".
"But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying their music or by supporting their "art") that I believe to be welcoming and spreading harmful ideologies to the community.
He's free.
And we too," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying it was now "the former known by Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to rename, following Diddy's past, also known by Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dog also used the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the missing Prince musical legend changed the name to a symbol and then to "the artist previously known by Prince".
Prosecution of attempted murder after being stabbed in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man had been stabbed in a restaurant in the eastern part of Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, said the police.
The appeal is scheduled to be brought before the Belfast Court on Monday.
The charges will be analysed by the public ministry.
KIT Harington Thrones War Star Attacks Toxic Manhood
Kit Harington is known for his role as a smurf as Jon Snow in the violent series of medieval fantasy of HBO, the War of Thrones.
However, at 31 years of age, the actor attacked the stereotype of the maquisist hero, claiming that such wallpapers on the screen often make boys feel that they have to be hard to respect.
In a conversation with Sunday Times Culture, Kit reported that he believed that "something went wrong" and questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his colleague in the Battle of the Rose Leslie Thrones, also at 31 years of age, admitted that he has a "very strong position" on the approach to the problem.
"I have a pretty strong personal position at this point: what went wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What have we been teaching men when they are growing up in terms of the problem we are seeing now?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise of toxic maleity due to its very male characters.
And he continued, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that make young people feel that they have to belong to this particular form of masculinity?
I think this is one of the great issues of our time: how can we change this?
Because clearly something went very wrong for young people."
In the interview, the actor also admitted that he would not enter any pre-healings or sequels of the Thrones War when the series ended in the next summer, referring to that for him, the "fighting camps and horses" ended.
From November, Kit will participate in a re-edition of True West by Sam Shepard, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thought finding his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the Thrones War.
"I met my wife in this series, so she somehow gave me my future family and my life forward," she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the loving interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the series of fantasy won with Emmys.
The couple gave the note in June 2018 on the property of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% of new cases
China announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health authorities said.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases result from sexual intercourse, which marks a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was reduced to practically zero, the Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in terms of annual homologous variation, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual relations is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against the LGBT community is frequent.
Studies estimated that, due to the conservative values in the country, 70 to 90% of men who had sex with other men ended up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases stem from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters desperately flees information about Republican senators by a collaborator and attacks the "dangerous lies" and the "conspiracy theories"
The Congressman of the United States Maxine Waters denied on Saturday the allegations that a member of his team would have published personal information from three members of the U.S. Senate on the pages of the Wikipedia of legislators.
Los Angeles Democrat stated that the charges were being promoted by opinion leaders and "ultradrite" sites.
"Disgusting lies, lies and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly includes residences of the homes and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a hearing with a Senate panel on allegations of improper sexual conduct against Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court.
The leak of information occurred some time after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Puntit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the publications was associated with the Waters Office and published the data of a Waters staff member, reported The Hill.
"This unsubstantiated accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"My collaborator, whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations, had no responsibility for this leak of information.
This unsubstantiated accusation is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly attracted online criticism, including those of the former press secretary of the White House Ari Fleischer.
"This lie is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"That suggests she doesn't have the temper to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something that is not your responsibility, you can't get angry.
You can't have a challenging attitude.
You can't question the accused's motives.
It must reveal calmness and serenity."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of pretending to be too angry during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who will argue the Waters place in the intercalary elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very serious if it's true," he read on his tweet.
In his statement, Waters stated that his office had warned "the competent authorities" about these fraudulent allegations.
"We ensure that the guilty will be revealed," he continued, "and will be legally held responsible for all their acts, which are destructive and dangerous to all and any members of my staff."
Criticism of Johnny English Back to Attack - weak espionage parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now fashionable to look for connotations with Brexit in any new film with a British taste, and this seems to actually apply to the new edition in the series of comedy movies and action Johnny English, started in 2003 with "Johnny English" and brought back to life in 2011 with "The Return of Johnny English".
Is the ironic self-satisfaction on the subject of being so bad is the new opportunity to export to the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes blurred and an excessively elastic expression, obtained his license to create confusion, renewed a second time - with his name to signal, more than anything, that is a comprehensive comic creation for non-anglophil films.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to a soft glamorous, has a bit of Cloiseau, a question from Mr. Bean and something from that fulan who contributed with a single note to the theme of the movie "Moments of Glory" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
In addition, his character was originally based on the traveler and a mysterious international man whose role Atkinson played in TV ads for Barclaycard, who left chaos in his trail.
There is one or two interesting moments in this latest edition of JE.
I loved the scene where Johnny English is approaching a helicopter carrying a medieval armor, with the rotor's legs to make briefly a noise of carriage against the helmet.
Atkinson's talent for comedy is obvious, but humor sounds weak and strangely superfluous, especially considering that the editions of "serious" films such as the 007 and the Impossible Mission now confidently propose comedy as an ingredient.
We get the idea that humor is directed at children and not adults and, in my opinion, Johnny English's bizarre disadvantages are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's changing film numbers in Bean's character.
Now, the premise, always current, is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A computer pirate infiltrated the network of British super-secret spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground for the consternation of the service agent, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last drop for a prime minister who is incarcerating a pompous and conflicting figure, already suffering a total breakdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives his best with this role that reminds the character of Theresa May, but the argument does not give much material for large flights.
Their secret service advisors inform her that once all the agents in the asset have been compromised, she will have to remove someone from the reform.
And this person is the distraught Johnny English, now working as a professor in a chic school, but giving non-official lessons about how to be an infiltrated spy: here are some interesting numbers, because English offers us a spy academy in the style of the movie "School de Rock".
English is taken quickly to Whitehall to receive emergency instructions and to join his suffering assistant Bough, a paper played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, attached to a submarine commander, a fussy character in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
Thus, Batman and Robin of the disaster at His Majesty's Secret Service are back to action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletin, a role played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being dangerously embellished by the billion-dollar charismatic technology that claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the leftist Jason Volta, performed by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odious odious acts of disaster: dissatisfaction with table employees, set fire to a visionary French restaurant, create confusion by entering as clandestines into the luxurious Volta yacht, and English triggers pure anarchy as it tries to use virtual reality glasses to get familiar with the inside of the Volta house.
All the stops were certainly created in view of this last sequence, but for more sympathetic and stormy than that, the set has enough TV for children.
The result is pretty medium.
And as in other Johnny English films, I couldn't stop investigating: couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent?
Workers deny that they are generating a plan for British workers to work four days a week, but receiving five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party may be considering a radical plan to provide the British with a work week of four days, but with five days paid.
Reports suggest that the party wants the patrons to review the savings with the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) for the workers, giving them a day of extra strike.
The workers got a three-day weekend, but keeping the order.
Sources indicate that the idea of "adjusting" to the party's economic programme, which refocuss the country in favour of the workers.
The shift to a four-day working week received the favourable opinion of the Congress of the Unions as a form of workers taking advantage of the changes in the economy.
A senior head of the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: "We hope to announce a policy review before the end of the year.
"It will not happen from one day to the next, but a four-day work week is an ambition adjusted to the party's approach to the rebalancing of the economy in favour of the worker, as well as the overall strategy of the party for the industrial sector."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, since the Green Party had already proposed a four-day work week during its 2017 legislative election campaign.
However, this aspiration is currently not supported by the whole Labour Party.
One party spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not part of the party's policy and we are not considering it."
The shadow finance minister John McDonnell used the party's conference last week to reveal his vision of a socialist revolution of the economy.
McDonnell claimed that he was determined to recover the power of the hands of the "no-face directors" and the "speculators" of the basic services companies.
Their plans also include the non-recovery of the total shareholding of current water companies, as the Labour Party may make "deductions" based on the perception of illegal conduct.
McDonnell also confirmed plans to place employees in company management boards and create inclusive ownership funds that transfer 10% of the share of private companies to employees, which will be able to pay annual dividends that can amount to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell the "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh can do it or not change ideas
The FBI investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote of his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, raising questions as to whether the conclusions could lead Republican senators to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be held on Sunday, Scott Pelley's "60 Minutes" correspondent asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out something that would change their ideas.
Kennedy proved to be more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"When I went to the hearing, I said, "I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when this claim came up, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolved, certainly, unmistakably."
Graham's vote, however, seems inconceivable.
"I am determined about Brett Kavanaugh and an explosive charge would be necessary," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett made a powerful lie," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she mentioned couldn't confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything change again."
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did you do something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the city of New York will host the Global Citizens Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive list of stars that will act on an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
Already in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will host tens of thousands of people in the Grand Hall of Central Park, not only to watch performances like that of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to strengthen awareness of the real objective of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a defence group that expects to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the spectators had to execute a series of tasks, or "actions", such as voluntary, sending an e-mail to a world leader, a telephone call or any other significant ways that contribute to increasing awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
However, what was the degree of success of Global Citizens these 12 years in achieving their goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade them to demand action, or is this just another case of "clichetivism" - do we think it makes a difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Global Citizen claims that since 2011, it has registered more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters who have exerted pressure to achieve a number of different goals.
These actions, according to the organization, have contributed to the announcement by world leaders of commitments and policies valued at more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, with at least $10 billion relating to them already disbursed or hired.
The group estimates that the funds obtained so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people scattered around the world.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the UK, bringing together investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential", which promised to give Rwanda $35 million to help end sub-nutrition in the country. This after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like all of us, we can make the social injustice of sub-nutrition a footnote in history," said Tracey Ulllman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, to a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group further stated that, after more than 5000 pressure actions on the United Kingdom in order to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it would finance a project, the Power of Nutrition, which would cover 5 million women and children, with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the site's frequent questions, "What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen answers: "It was a long and tortuous path - sometimes we fell and failed.
But, like the great movements by the civil rights and anti-apartheid that preceded us, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are among the artists who will perform this year's event in New York, presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the Navy as "block" to place an obstacle to Russia's energy exports - Interior Secretary
"If necessary," Washington may use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, revealed the Secretary of the US Interior Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, in particular, where the legitimate government's invitation intervenes, is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why you are in the Middle East is to seek to mediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe," he said.
And, according to the governor, there are ways and means to prevent it.
"The United States has the ability, with its navy, to ensure that the maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to block to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke was directed to participants at an event organized by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group called "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
In his speech, he continued to compare Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are indeed the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to leverage and replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as a "magic of a single trick" with a dependent economy of fossil fuels.
These statements arise at a time when the Trump administration is in a mission to increase natural gas exports to Europe, in place of Russia, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
To this end, the authorities of the Trump administration, including the president himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "inadequate" Nord Stream pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the North Stream pipeline, budgeted at $11 billion, aims to double the existing capacity for 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons, as an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure and that consumers must have the ability to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position prompted a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German industrial association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, the top manager of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "will examine thoroughly" the possibility of applying to the presidency in 2020, Senator of Massachusetts said.
Senator of the Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he will "determine thoroughly" the possibility of applying to the presidency following the intercalary elections.
During an informal public debate in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider the possibility of applying.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to repair our dysfunctional government, and this includes a woman as the maximum responsible," said The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will examine in depth the possibility of applying to the presidency."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the informal debate, saying that "I was taking the country in the wrong direction".
"I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren has been a loud criticism of Trump and his appointment to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On a tweet on Friday, Warren said that "it is clear that we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a survey conducted on Thursday revealed that the majority of Warren's own constituents were not of the opinion that she should apply for the presidency in 2020.
59% of Massachusetts's "probable" electors said the senator should not apply, according to a survey by Suffolk/Boston Globe University Political Research Centre.
32% support their candidacy.
The survey revealed a higher support for a candidacy by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour of a potential candidacy and 48% against.
Other prominent names of the Democratic Party debated on a potential candidate in 2020 include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions the post-traumatic stress of Track Palin at a start of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after his list in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of an incident of domestic violence
"What my own son is going on, what's going on after he's back, I can identify with the other families who feel the post-traumatic stress branching and some of the injuries our soldiers are actually coming back with," said Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to the public of a commission in support of a post-traumatic stress branch.
Palin called this detention "the elephant in the room" and said that his son and other veterans "turn a little different, turn harder, go back and investigate whether there is respect for what his soldiers and aviators, and all the other members of the armed forces, gave to the country."
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman and possession of weapons as an alcoholic, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman of the Wasilla Police Department.
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia are supporting a legal challenge to a new US policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district sent a statement of friend curiae (friends of the court) on Friday in Washington, in support of an asylum applicant who is responding to this policy, referred to NBC News.
The full name of the complaint in the Grace vs. Sessions that the American Civil Liberties Union held in August against politics was not revealed.
The person claimed that his partner "and his children, members of a violent gang", abused her, but the US authorities refused his asylum application on July 20th.
The complaint was arrested in Texas.
The government ministries that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum candidates in the United States, such as nations that face widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy repealed a 2014 decision of the Immigrant Resources Council to allow immigrants without documents of domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Attorney General of the District of Colombia Karl Racine stated, in a statement on Friday, that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international laws".
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the facts and specific circumstances underlying them; this prohibition violates this principle," read the statement of friend curiae.
The lawyers also argued in this statement that the ban on the entry of immigrants by the police negatively affects the US economy, saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "available the necessary labour".
The Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing from domestic violence and gangs in June.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear based on ethnicity, religion, nationality or belonging to a specific social group or with a particular political opinion," Sessions said in their policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum has never been meant to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people face every day throughout the world.
Disillusioned rescue efforts in Palu when the number of dead doubles in a counter-hour to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
"The environment is very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, mother of a febrile male baby, in comforting him in an evacuation centre in the city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance brings more bodies.
There's a shortage of clean water."
Residents were visited who returned to their ruined houses to try to save everything they could find among their water-sucked belongings.
There were hundreds of injuries and hospitals, damaged by magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Harris, who fractured the ribs and the shoulder, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where the patients were treated abroad because of the strong replicas they continued.
His eyes were bathed in tears when he told how he felt when the violent earthquake shook him in the hotel room of the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I believe," said Harris to the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife yell for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope you're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of "intimidating" with "advertising announcements"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper had published a four-page ad in a daily newspaper in the United States promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, referred last Wednesday to the supplement paid by China Daily at the Des Moines Register, the newspaper with the most withdrawal from the state of Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6th elections to Congress, a charge falseled by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections marked the beginning of what the American authorities, in statements to Reuters, designated as a new phase in the growing Washington campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently hindering an increasingly intense trade war which has seen both sides apply tariff fluctuations on the imports of the other.
China's retaliation rates in the initial stages of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states that support the Republican Party of Trump, Chinese and North American specialists say.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former Iowa long-term governor, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, claimed that Beijing has damaged workers, farmers and American companies.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "is now placing the foot on the accelerator of this intimidation with the publication of advertising ads in our free press".
"With the spread of this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the pernicious American tradition of freedom of expression and of the press by publishing a pay ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad said.
"On the other hand, in the banks here in Beijing, we find very few dissident voices and we will never see a real reflection of the differences of opinion that Chinese people may have of the worrying economic trajectory of their country, because the media are under firm control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
In addition, he added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not mention which.
Republicans alienate female voters before the intercalary elections with the Kavanaugh disaster, warn analysts
At a time when many important Republicans support and defend the appointment to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh in the face of the various charges of sexual assault, analysts warn that such a negative reaction, particularly of women, may occur during the inter-oral elections that are soon to take place.
The emotions around the case have been very strong and the majority of Republicans have said publicly that they intend to move forward for a vote.
These things have no setbacks," from this to The Hill Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell School of Syracuse University, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher claimed that he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last hour's pressure to conduct an FBI investigation would be enough to appease the rebel voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior national adviser and spokesperson for the Progressive Group MoveOn, according to Washington newspaper, D.C.
On Friday morning, Protestants sang "November is at the door!" when they protested in the Senate's courtroom, since the Republicans who control the Judicial Committee chose to move forward with the appointment of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the democrats will beat all the records," said Stu Rothenberg's news site, a political analyst with no party membership.
"People say it's already high; it's true.
But it can be even higher, especially among the indecisive voters in the suburban areas and the younger voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony describing his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a negative reaction could occur if the Republicans went ahead with the confirmation.
"This has become a trap for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Republican Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote, or about whether Kavanaugh will take its place as a judge. It's also about how the Republicans dealt with the matter and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, US Priorities Director, a group that helps to elect Democrats, to the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided about whom to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority aligning with the first.
A new YouTube survey revealed that 41% of respondents believed absolutely or probably in Ford's testimony, while 35% said they believed absolutely or probably in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% claimed that they considered Kavanaugh had probably or absolutely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake's proposal, the FBI launched an investigation into Ford's allegations, as well as another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford mentioned under oath to the Senate Judicial Committee last week that Kavanaugh had sexually harassed her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the appointment to the Supreme Court exposed his genital organs when the two participated in a party during the period during which they both studied in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web aims to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, an inventor of the World Wide Web, created a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The most recent project of this legendary character of technologies, Inrupt, is a company that takes advantage of Berners-Lee’s open source platform, Solid.
This allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee said in a play that the intention underlying the Inrupt is to "dominating the world".
"We have to do it now," he said regarding the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data storage", or POD.
This may include contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in a single browser and at the same time.
What is unique about online personal data storage is that it is only for the user to decide who has access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal training through the data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to John Bruce's CEO, is to provide adequate resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some internal programmers hired to work on the project and a volunteer programming community.
Starting this week, world-wide technology creators will be able to create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt site.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to the "Facebook and Google about the introduction or not of a total change in which all their business models are turned from one day to the next.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a publication in the Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to create commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new Web created with Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic with this next age of the Web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: honour the clergy decorated with Victoria Cross in the First Great War
The only clergy of the Church of England to receive Victoria Cross during the First Great War as a combatant was honored in its native city for 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann obtained the decoration on 29 September 1918 with the attack on Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a four-day freelance shooter and never knew he had received the highest British military honor.
Their two grandchildren opened a memorial plate at a stop in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of them, Michael Vann, claimed that it was "bright symbolic" that the plate had been presented exactly 100 years after the fact that it gave the decoration to his grandfather.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battle through the Canal of Saint-Quentin "in a very thick fog and under closed fire of portable and machine guns".
Then he ran to the line of fire and, "with the greatest courage", led the line forward before attacking himself a cannon and beating three soldiers from the stand.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German freeman on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, mentioned that his grandfather's actions were "something I know he would never be able to equal, but also a lesson of humility".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, deposited a crown of flowers after the stop, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he "felt very honored to participate in the stop" and added that "the courage of a genuine hero is being demonstrated through the support that will be given by many people".
Fans of mixed martial arts agreed all night to see Bellator 206 attend instead to Porca Peppa
Imagine this: you wake up all night to see Bellator 206, full of vedets and, at the end, you are prevented from seeing the main event.
The San José series included 13 fights, with six of the main group, and was being displayed live during the night in the United Kingdom, in Channel 5.
At six o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the match, the spectators in the United Kingdom were startled when the cover changed to the Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after being woken up until early in the morning especially for the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the change to cartoons for children as "a kind of bad-like joke".
"The government's regulation says that the content is not suitable for six in the morning, so they had to change to another programming," said Dave Schwartz, a marketing and communications administrator when asked about the transmission.
"Peppa's ass," yes.
Bellator’s president, Scott Coker, said that it would revise the transmission schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think, when I think about repetition, I think we can solve the problem," said Coker.
"But there are six Sunday mornings there and we will not be able to resolve it until our Sunday hour, which is a second fair in British time.
But we're working on it.
I'm not lying when I say that when programming changed, there were lots of messages exchanged and none very nice.
We were trying to solve the problem, and we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't: it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen next time.
We'll reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "less" about his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that it gave him the motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn't realize until he went into high school that "they're all like me."
In an interview with the first Desert Island Discs of Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he stated that he was in favour of the rights of homosexuals to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a father made him less worried about winning the Olympics.
The regular long-term program presentation, Kirsty Young, took a strike of several months due to the disease.
Appearing as a pair in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" to everyone else because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
In his words, "to this day, this impression of feeling smaller and different has been the real reason that has given me the power and strength to achieve success".
Their goal was to prove that it was "someone", he said, not to disappoint everyone when they discovered their sexuality sooner or later.
The double Olympic bronze medalist became a prominent LGBT activist and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
According to him, he manifested himself because he felt happy to be able to live openly without consequences and intended to give "hope" to others.
The world trim champion reported that falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013, "suddenly caught me."
Daley married last year to Oscar's winner, 20 years older, although he claimed that the age difference never posed a problem.
"When we pass when we are so young" - his first participation in the Olympic Games was at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - reported, it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has passed through high and low alike.
The couple had a son last June, called Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his prospects" had changed.
"If I had been asked last year, everything that mattered was "getting a gold medal," he said.
There are more things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
Your son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley mentioned that his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they already had tickets for the London games in 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell you you weren't going to be here to be in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only when he actually stopped breathing and died that I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"I was fully aware that it was what I had dreamed of my whole life: diving in front of a crowd of compatriots in the Olympic Games...there was no better feeling," he said.
All this was also the inspiration of his first song choice - Proud, Heather Small - with which he had identified himself during the preparation for the Olympics, and which still gives him chicken skin.
The Desert Island Discs passes on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m., British summer hour.
Mickelson down in the bank at Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will achieve a record on Saturday when fighting his 47th match at a Ryder Cup, but he will have to recover his way to prevent the frame from symbolizing an unfortunate occasion.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for the 12th time, a record of participation, was sent to the bank by Captain Jim Furyk at the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as many times have been in the United States teams, the winner of the main male championships five times divided the day between the role of supporters and the work in their game in the field, in the hope of rehabilitating what afflicts him.
Never having given hits to the most challenging even in the height of your career, the 48-year-old player is not the ideal for the Le Golf National field, where the long rough usually punishes the wrong hits.
And if the field by itself was not sufficiently intimidation, Mickelson, on Sunday's ninth game, will face the exact British Open Francesco Molinari champion, who teamed with the initiator Tommy Fleetwood, winning all four matches they had this week.
If Americans, with a four-point disadvantage to start the 12 singles, record a good start, Mickelson's match can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but he couldn't say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a palm on my back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a respected champion who's given these teams a huge deal in the past, and also this week.
I probably hadn't faced seeing him playing two games.
I thought more about it, but that's how it happened and that's how we thought we'd have to keep going.
He wants to be in the game, like everyone else."
Mickelson will cross Nick Faldo's record on Sunday from the largest number of games in the Ryder Cup.
This may mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never matched the successes of your individual curriculum.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven shots, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has created some tangible advantages for the team.
"He is sarcastic, funny and spiritual, likes to play with people and is an excellent person to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players have had fun with him this week, which was fun to see.
He gives a lot more than just playing."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that his great advantage can disappear in an apex
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that his leadership faded into the last day of singles at Ryder Cup can easily become an accident.
The Danish had its star in the beginning of 1997 in Valderrama, where a team captained by Seven Ballesteros maintained a five-point advantage over the Americans, but crossed the finish line with the nose with the narrowest of the margins, winning by 1411⁄2-131.2.
"We always try to remember that we had a considerable advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we gained, but little by little," said Bjorn, in the image, after attending the 2018 Tourna by 5-3, both on Friday and yesterday, to lead by 10-5 in Le Golf National.
So, history has shown me and everyone on this team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow, give your best.
Go over there and do everything right.
This doesn't end until we have the points on the marker.
We have a goal that is to try to win this trophy and that is where the approach should remain.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are well aware of who is on the other side: the best players in the world."
Delighted at the performance of their players in a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never go ahead with myself in this.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What matters tomorrow are individual performances and this involves a different task.
It's great to be there with a partner when things are going well, but when we're there on our own, our skills as golfers are tested to the maximum.
This is the message that you need to send to players: tomorrow, give your best.
Now they're gonna leave the partner and he has to go and give the best of himself too."
In contrast to Bjorn, the opponent Jim Furyk will seek to have his players perform better individually than as partners, constituting the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points in four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of these great revolutions on the last day, having been part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he finished losing when Europe took the "Millagre in Medina" from the cartel.
"I remember all the words," he said in answer to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to get that fast start like what you saw in Brooklyn and what you saw in Medina.
When this impotence moves towards one side, the pressure is very great in these middle parts.
We organised our actual in accordance and ordered the players the way we feel, you know, that we're going to try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas, with the mission to try to lead the counterattack, faced Rory McIlroy in the main game, being Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the first half of the order.
"I chose this group of players for this order because I think it covers the entire route," Bjorn said about his choices for singles.
New German warship once more delayed
The German Navy's latest frigate should have entered the service in 2014 to replace warships of the Cold War. However, it will be necessary to wait at least until next year, due to systems prone to accidents and a cost of exponential growth, according to local media.
The entry into the service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the commander of the newest badats of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which quoted a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the disturbing post-delivery problems have undermined the fate of the ambitious project.
The four boats of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the Navy had ordered in 2007 will be used to replace the older Bremen class frogs.
It is known that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, in addition to a series of anti-aircraft missiles and anti-shipments, as well as some furtive technologies such as the reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenances, which would allow the most recent frigates to be sent to missions with a maximum duration of two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continuing delays made that with the warships of the last generation, considered as a form of Germany designing beyond borders, they will already be unupdated when they enter service, says Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made mangroves last year when the German Navy refused to put it in service, having returned it to the shipyards of Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cite a series of crucial "hardware and software defects" that would make the warship useless if used in a combat mission.
The weaknesses of the software were particularly important, since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the quota required in the oldest Bremen class frigates.
It was also known that the boat is too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the marine's ability to install additional features in the future.
It is believed that the 7000-tonnes Rhineland-Palatinate has twice the weight of similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the total project price, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that this will have reached a sumptuous EUR 3.1 billion, an increase compared to the EUR 2.2 billion initially budgeted.
The problems that strike the most recent fractures have become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that German naval power is weakening.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, leader of the German parliamentary commission for defence, acknowledged that the Navy is currently missing ships capable of being used."
The politician claimed that the problem had grown exponentially over time, as older ships were put out of service without ships to replace them.
In the end, he regretted that none of the baden-Wuerttemberg-class frogs could join the Navy.
National Trust spys on the secret life of the martyrs
New research is being carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands with the aim of revealing how the mosquitoes use the landscape to look for food.
It is expected that the results will shed some light on the behavior of these single flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common bites and fruit, as well as long ears and Daubenton bites at the Inverewe Gardens in West Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations scattered by the property to follow the activities of the bats throughout the station.
Mobile studies will also be carried out by NTS personnel and volunteers with portable detectors.
The analysis by experts of all recordings will evaluate the frequency of the call for bats and what each species is doing.
A map of the habitat will then be produced to create a detailed picture of its behaviors on a territorial scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS nature conservation advisor, expects the results to reveal which areas of habitat are most important for mosquitoes and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forests for bats and associated species.
Mortgage populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined considerably over the last century.
These animals are threatened by construction and development works that affect the dormitories and make the habitat scarce.
Wind turbines and lightnings are also a threat, along with the moss paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, given your night hunting habits, your ears are more useful than your eyes when it comes to catching prey.
It is used by them a sophisticated echo location technique to identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land throughout the region, takes the bites very seriously.
The organization has ten trained specialists who regularly conduct studies, dormitories inspections and sometimes rescues.
It also created the first reservation in Scotland dedicated exclusively to the Mortgage Aios, the Thrave property in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of Scottish Mortgage.
The property manager, David Thompson, says the same is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Thrave we have an excellent area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all this good habitat.
However, there is still much about the bites that we do not know, so the work we are doing here and in the other properties will help us know more about what they need to flourish."
He stressed the importance of checking whether there are bites before maintaining properties, as the unintentional destruction of just one motherhood dorm may lead to the death of up to 400 young females and animals, which could eradicate the entire local population.
The bites are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, ambush them, disturb them or destroy their dorms.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish member of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to participate to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we simply don't know how their populations are vindictive."
Ronaldo desperately charges of rape when his lawyers prepare to process German newspaper
Christian Ronaldo characterized the allegations of rape against him as "false news", claiming that people "want to promote themselves" using their name.
Your lawyers are preparing to process the German news magazine Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
The advance of the Portuguese and Juventus selection was accused of violating an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that you will then have to pay $375 000 to keep the victim silent about the accident, read in Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram at its 142 million followers hours after the disclosure of the allegations, Ronaldo, 33 years old, characterized the reports as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," the winner of five Golden Balls said to the chamber.
"They want to promote themselves at the expense of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's part of the profession.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to process Der Spiegel on the allegations, which have characterized as "an unacceptable report of suspicions in the field of privacy", according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz stated that the player would claim compensation for moral damage in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident will have occurred in June 2009 at a Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
After finding a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga will have allegedly gone to the player's room, where he will have violated it annually, according to the documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo put on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99%" "a good guy", damaged by "one percent".
The papers claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sexual relations, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that he was addressed to the police and had photographs of his injuries taken in a hospital, but that he later agreed to enter into an extrajudicial agreement because he felt "feared by the prospect of retaliation" and was concerned about the possibility of being "degraded publicly".
The woman, 34 years of age, now claims that she intends to withdraw the agreement, because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join the Royal Madrid, leaving Manchester United, at the time of the alleged aggression. This summer he moved to the Italian giants Juve in a business of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK "would regret it forever" losing car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "repent forever" if it lost its world leader status in the car manufacturing after Brexit, said the Secretary to the Greg Clark Companies.
Clark also mentioned that Toyota in the United Kingdom had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production of its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer said that the impact of delays on the borders in the case of an unagreed Brexit could lead to job loss.
The Burnaston factory, which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My perspective is that if Britain suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we will see production stops in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom expressed concerns about the EU's exit without an agreement on the level of operation of cross-border transactions, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said that it would close its Minis factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers claim to be the risks of the supply chain in the case of an unagreed Brexit.
Toyota's production line is managed on a "just-in-time" basis, with the parts to be reached every 37 minutes, from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU, for cars manufactured by order.
If the United Kingdom abandons the EU without agreement on 29 March, disturbances may occur at the border, which the sector says may lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to maintain more than one day of stock in its Derbyshire factory, the company said, so production would have to stop.
Clark stated that Theresa May's "Checkers Plan" for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
"We need to have an agreement. We want the best agreement that allows, as I said, not only the current success, but also the enjoyment by us of this opportunity," said the BBC Radio 4 programme Today.
"The evidence not only of Toyota but also of other manufacturers points out that we absolutely need to be able to continue with what has been a highly successful set of supply chains."
Although it had not been able to provide an estimate of the stop time, Toyota said that in the long term, the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and could, sooner or later, lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at Burnaston factory for 24 years and coordinates the United Union in this place, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "According to my experience, if they are lost, these jobs will never return.
A spokesman for the government said, "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says the White House
The important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "delayed another week" given that there is still no understanding as Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court, referred to the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of legal adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump advisers and Russia and the possible obstruction of justice by the President.
The fact that Trump could be preparing the resignation of the Deputy Attorney General, thus putting Mueller's independence at risk, has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
At the beginning of this month's New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of unparalleled recording talks with Trump and the possibility of deposing the President through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein lied to the information.
But on Monday he moved to the White House, having information that he would be about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, which was held in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that "I'd rather not fire" Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid overlap with a hearing of the Senate Justice Commission in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation with a duration of one week on charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the final vote in the Senate.
Trump's press advisor, Sarah Sanders, participated in Fox News Sunday.
Questioned about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date has not yet been marked, may be this week but may also be postponed another week, in view of everything that has happened in the Supreme Court.
Let's see, I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would disagree with this statement: Sanders has not organized a press conference in the White House since September 10.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences is not due to a diversion to the "protagonism" of television reporters, although he said that "it would not be inconsistent with the fact that they like protagonism."
He then realized that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President makes more questions and answers than any previous president," he said, adding, without adding evidence: "We have analyzed these numbers."
The press conferences will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that is infinitely better than talking to me.
We have tried to do this frequently and have seen that we have done so in recent weeks.
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences, when receiving foreign representatives.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week the president showed why in New York, appearing in a distraught and sometimes bizarre way in front of the present journalists.
Minister of Health writes to EU workers at the Scottish National Health Service about Brexit's fears
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express gratitude for the country and request that they stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter less than six months after leaving the UK of the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to running for the status of EU citizens working in the country's decentralised public services.
In his letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on withdrawal continued, pending decisions for this fall.
But the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible unagreed exit scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reaffirm at this time how much I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Fellows from all over the EU and from other sources bring valuable experience and skills, which strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we want you to continue here."
Christion Abercrombie submitted to emergency surgery after suffering injury in the head
The defense of Tennessee State Tigers, Christian Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgery after suffering head injuries in the Saturday defeat by 31-27 in front of the Vanderbilt Commodores, told Mike Organ, the Tigers.
Coach of the Tennessee team, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the interval.
"He approached the sideline and almost fainted," reported Reed.
The technical team and medical personnel placed Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before placing it in a mace and transporting it to a deeper assessment.
A team representative told Chris Harris of the Nashville WSMV, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the type/gratitude of the injury" and that the team is trying to find out when this happened.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, suspended the studies during the first season with the Tennessee State Tigers after a transfer from Illinois.
He made five spots on Saturday before leaving the game, which raises his total season to 18 spots.
A higher seal tax will be levied on foreign buyers when they acquire properties in the United Kingdom
The Conservative Party has announced plans to collect a higher seal tax on foreign buyers who have acquired properties in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to be invested in aid to homeless persons
The measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract the youngest electorate
The increase in seal tax will affect buyers who are not taxed in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance hopes to hire up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
A higher seal tax rate will be charged to foreign buyers who have acquired properties in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to be invested in homeless aid, Theresa May will today announce.
The measure is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract the youngest electorate, with promises to provide more affordable accommodation and tax higher incomes.
The rise in seal tax will affect people and companies not taxed in the United Kingdom, with the additional revenue to boost the government's campaign to offer a roof to homeless people.
The surplus - added to the current seal tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for the second rooms and rental purchases - may rise to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to take up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13% of the new buildings in London are acquired by non-residents in the United Kingdom, making prices rise and making it difficult for first-house buyers to access the market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially capital - have become "phantom cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy arises weeks after Boris Johnson has demanded a stamp tax cut to help young people acquire their first apartment.
He accused the large construction companies of keeping the prices of the high properties when landing land that they did not use, demanding that Mrs. May leave the quotas on the affordable accommodation to resolve the "dissatisfaction of the accommodation" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a joint appeal for housing reform proposals, including income controls and the end of "no justification".
He also wants to attribute extended powers to the municipalities for the construction of new houses.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I stated that I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream that living conditions should be improved for each new generation.
And that means solving the problem of our real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not as easy to buy a house for people living outside the United Kingdom and for foreign companies as for British resident workers.
For too many people the dream of being the owner of their home has become too remote and the shame of those who sleep at the slow continues to be too real."
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to guide Scotland"
Sunderland coach Jack Ross said his "final ambition" is to become a Scottish selector.
The 42-year-old Scottish has succeeded in the challenge of giving new life to the club of the northeastern, currently third classified in the First League, to three points of leadership.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St. Mirren on his return to the First Scottish Division in the past.
"I want to represent my country as a player.
But I only got an internationalisation B," Ross told the BBC Scotland Sportssound program.
"I grew to see Scotland play in Hampden with my father and these are some of my best memories.
But this opportunity will only arise if you succeed in managing clubs."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic says he was not afraid to happen to names so consecrated in such a large club, after rejecting invitations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, the success at the moment is summed up to "Can I take the club back to the Premier League?"
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, its location is undoubtedly at the Premier League," he said.
"It won't be easy to take the club back, but I'll just think I've done well here when I reach that goal."
Ross's career as a coach is only three years, after a period as an assistant coach of Dumbarton and 15 months in the technical team of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and took St. Mirren from the threat of the promotion until the title of the champion in the following period.
Ross refers to feeling more comfortable now than ever during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
Taking care of Alloa "was a real crucifix," remember.
"I've always seen myself more in the coach role than in the player.
It seems strange because it went well, I won life as a player and I had some high moments in my career.
But playing can be very hard.
We face many challenges every week.
I still face them in terms of stress and load pressures, but I feel very well as a coach.
I've always wanted to train and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I've ever felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a painting is 17:30 on Saturday, according to a study
The summer heat wave filled the British pubs, but put more pressure on the chains of restaurants.
Restoration groups recorded 2.7% growth in sales in July, but the occupation of restaurants decreased 4.8%, showing statistics.
Peter Martin of the CGA consultant, who compiled the statistics, said: "The continuation of good time and England's career at the World Football Championship, longer than expected, made the pattern of June, in which the pubs recorded an increase of 2.8% in sales, if repeated in July, but the restaurants knew a retreat.
The fall of 1.8% recorded in the sales of the restoration in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars with the shop sitting in the drinks had the best performance far away, with a homologous growth more than compensated for the descent of the restaurants.
Pubs with business sitting in meals also experienced difficulties, although not as dramatic as those of the restoration operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars managed directly, the sales of drinks rose by 6.6% during the month, with the meals to decrease by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst in the leisure and RSM restoration sectors, said: "These results extend the trend we have recorded since the end of April.
Meteorology and the impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors that influence sales of the food market outside the home.
It is no surprise that the restoration groups continue to face difficulties, although the annual drop in sales of 4.8% is particularly harmful when added to the increase in cost pressure.
The long and hot summer could not reach a worse time for the operators with the business sitting in the meals. Only time will tell if the colder temperatures we know in August will provide the desired relief."
The growth of total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in branding.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the sectoral indicator for sales of British pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operational groups, with a combined turnover of more than 9 billion pounds, being recognised as the benchmark of the sector.
One in every five children hides their parents' secret accounts on social networks
One in five children - some with only 11 years of age - has secret accounts in the social networks that hide parents and teachers, revealed a study
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the "false" pages in Instagram
The news exacerbates fears about the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of students claimed to have a "main" account to show their parents
One in five children - some with only 11 years of age - creates accounts on the social networks that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in "false" accounts on Instagram's photo sharing site.
The news exacerbates fears about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of students claimed to have an innocent "main" account to show their parents, while having private accounts at the same time.
A mother who found the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter discovered that the teenager was urging others to "violate her."
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) of independent schools, revealed that 40% of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, half of which admitted to keeping private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilid Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilid Doyle was elected non-executive Director of the Scottish Athletics Council at the Annual General Assembly of the Regulator.
Doyle is the most successful athlete in Scotland. President Ian Beattie described the appointment as an excellent opportunity for sports regulators to take advantage of their vast international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is extremely respected throughout the Scottish, British and world community of athleticism and we are sure that Scottish athleticism will have much to gain with its presence in the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm excited to be able to act like the voice of athletes and I hope to be able to truly contribute to helping to guide sports in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-400-metre trials at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and who is currently a regular commentator at the BBC, stopped walking after a transitional ischemic vascular accident.
As he wrote on Twitter: "Make today a month that suffers from a stroke.
I stopped walking.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I could recover and to what extent.
It has been a painful work but it achieves total recovery, resume walking and even do exercise of agility!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Milk extraction pump ad compares mothers to cows, dividing their opinions online
A milk pump company divided the opinions online with an ad comparing mothers who breast-feed cows in order.
To mark the launch of what is described as the "first portable silent pump of milk extraction", the consumer technology company Elvie launched an ironic announcement inspired by the music videos to highlight the freedom granted by the new pump to mothers who extract milk.
Four mothers dance in a feno-filled vacuum to the sound of a music that includes verses such as: "Yes, I'm ordering, but I don't have a tail" and "If you haven't fixed, I don't have tits, these are my tits."
"Bombs, pumpkins, baby food, pumpkins, pumpkins, pumpkins, I'm ordering my girls."
However, the ad published on the company's Facebook page generated controversy online.
With 77,000 visualizations and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from the viewers, with many to say it allays the "horrors" of the lattice sector.
"You have decided to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only their babies are stolen from them a few days after they were born," wrote one viewer.
The Elvie extraction pump is discreetly located inside a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Comprehensibly traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to announce an extraction bomb for mothers who can stay with their babies?"
Someone also said, "An ad with a huge lack of sensitivity."
Others defended the ad, like a woman who admitted to finding the song "hilarizing".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
The extraction made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy but it makes all the sense.
This product is great," wrote one of the women.
Another commented: "It's a fun ad addressed to mothers who extract milk (many times in bathrooms or at work) and feel like "vacas".
It's not an ad to praise or judge the Latini sector."
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they were dancing with the discreet bombs housed in the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the information that many women who extract milk with bombs claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie bomb is completely silent, it has no wires or tubes and has discreetly hair inside a breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move around, catch up with their babies and even leave home while they milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and Creative Director of "Mother", commented: "The Elvie bomb is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative release.
By establishing a parallel between women who extract milk and milk cows, we wanted to highlight all the challenges of milk extraction, as we presented in a fun way and with which people can identify the incredible sense of freedom provided by the new bomb.
It wasn't the first time the Elvie bomb was a stain.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children paraded at the passerelle to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children discreetly moved to a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained reached a peak, although the monthly crossings of the border have remained relatively unchanged, partly because the severe rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to train children.
Traditionally, most of the "patrinos" are themselves undocumented immigrants, fearing to compromise their own possibility of staying in the country by offering to step up a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential employers and other adults who integrate their family members should register their fingerprints, sharing the data with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Alfandegas Control Service, testified before Congress that the service detains dozens of people who have applied for non-accompanied minors.
The service subsequently confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal record.
"Approximately 80% of the family members or family members are illegal in the country, and many of them are foreigners with criminal records.
That is why we will continue to pursue these individuals," said Mr Albence.
In order to speed up the processing of children, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within one month of the date of detention, instead of 60 days, the previous rule, according to the staff of the reception centres.
Many are present by videoconference, not in person, to defend their application for legal status before a judge of the immigration court.
Those considered ineligible for aid shall be immediately deported.
The longer the children are detained, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which may lead to access to violence or attempted escape, according to the staff of the reception centres and reports produced by the system in recent months.
Immigrant rights defenders say that these concerns are exacerbated in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where the large size contributes to the neglect of children's disturbances.
They add that the transfer of children to camps without leaving time for their emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends makes the trauma worse with which many are already discussing.
Syria demands immediate withdrawal from the American, French and Turkish "occupational forces"
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also requested the return of Syrian refugees to their homes, despite the war in the country in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism, and that "they will be treated as such".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, in a war that left millions of displaced people.
He said that Damascus would continue to "break this sacred battle until we free all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and from "all and any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly training and advising the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this country devastated by the war.
With regard to the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions for their return were assured, accusing "some Western countries" of "spoiling irrational fears" that led refugees to stay abroad.
"We ask the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid for the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a security zone in the last major rebel base of Idlib created an opportunity to insist on political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has avoided a large-scale attack by the Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement established "clear spaces" and expressed hope that the military action would target the jihadists, including the fighters of the Al-Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who would "be eradicated".
The United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria, preparing the ground for elections.
Moualem laid down conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the panel should be limited to "revision of the articles of the current constitution" and warning against possible interference.
Because Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers are likely to expect, the opposition and scandals would sooner end their presidency.
In the one who would undoubtedly constitute "the most dramatic final of an everlasting presidency"!
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue from the spectators.
Since 2014, senior hearings have been more than doubled to 1.05 million in the CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million in the MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million spectators in noble hours, a climb to the 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the "Rachel Maddow Show" of MSNBC led the cable hearings with up to 3.5 million spectators on the big news nights.
"This is a strong call for people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, ABC program producer "Designated Survival", about a cabinet chief who becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
In Scovell, a veteran comedian and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
Remember when you called a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh," told me Scovell.
Chaos have value for entertainment.
Of course, unlike television programs, stories from Washington can determine the future of abortion legislation, the right to family meetings of immigrants and the health of the global economy.
Changing the program is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can give.
And yet it is more than being an informed citizen when we are attending the sixth hour of a debate by experts on the use by Bob Woodward of sources "with deep knowledge" in his book "Fear", the $15,000 obstetric leather blouse by Paul Manafort ("a piece of clothing full of insult," as mentioned by Washington Post) and the implications of the slender descriptions of Stormy Daniels of... hum... anatomy by President Trump.
For my part, I will never again face the Super Mario in the same way.
"Part of what he has done seems to be a reality show because he gives us something every night," said Brent Montgomery, director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", on Trump's dynamic list and the daily twists of the grid (antigonizing with the NFL, commend Kim Jong-Un).
We can't lose any episode or we're back.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week they were 26th on the northern coast of Kaui, but he was closed at home, seeing MSNBC while recording CNN.
I did not detract from the television while Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to testify before the Senate Court, with the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I still remember when we did all those crazy programs and people said: this is the principle of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but at last they were right."

Significant external financing in the inter-chamber elections to the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th cycle of Pennsylvania has a funding flow, thanks to the reorganization of the electoral circles that left two candidates in the race for the same place.
The recent re-adjustment of Pittsburgh's suburban circles put in the race Democratic Conor Lamb, who won his place in another circle in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb is running against another titler, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th circle of Pennsylvania, which is largely superior to the new 17th circle.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the former circles would unconstitutionally favour the Republicans.
The 17th round launched a hard fight for the financing of the campaign between the financial arms of the main parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a tangential victory in the extremely controversial extraordinary March elections for the 18th electoral round of the Pennsylvania Congress.
This place was occupied for more than a decade by a Republican and President Donald Trump won in the circle by 20 percentage points.
Analysts have given a slight advantage to the democrats.
USA thought to penalize El Salvador for supporting China, then back up
Some diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with few Washington protests.
President Trump had a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled Trump Organisation from the management.
Representatives of the Department of State decided to call the leaders of the US diplomatic representations in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after the "recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, spokesman for the Department of State, in a communication this month.
But only sanctions were considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million of US aid in 2017, including for controlling drug trafficking, economic aid and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial assistance and specific visa restrictions, would have severely punished this Central American country with high rates of unemployment and homicide.
With the continuation of internal meetings, representatives of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on economic security and prosperity, following a similar meeting last year as a step forward in efforts to prevent the entry of immigrants into the United States.
But in mid-September, top officials of the Administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, putting aside all and any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has scheduled an intervention at the conference, now marked for mid-October, in a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, the diplomats said.
The three American representatives discreetly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any hard messages or punishment from Washington.
The spokesman for the White House for Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about the internal deliberations on the coverage of the anonymity.
His reports were confirmed by an external analyst near the Administration, who also requested the anonymity.
Study History
The next bomb to be released may be the report by legal adviser Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, on which there is currently substantial evidence in the public domain.
Mueller will be allegedly guiding his investigation to ascertain whether Trump's campaign conspired with Russia to attack the elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will face responsibility on the part of that body, while preparing to present himself again to the electors and perhaps to be judged by their peers.
There are many possibilities and I do not want to suggest that Mr Trump's fall be inevitable - or that of his fellow citizens in Europe.
There are choices we have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, some German officials were prepared to testify to Hitler in a coup d'état, since the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We've missed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of carnival that followed.
The course of history revolves around points of inflection like this, in which the inexhaustible march of democracy is accelerated or hampered.
The Americans are currently facing several of these inflexible points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been under threat since this newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested to record the President secretly, speculating about his inability to perform the task.
Rosenstein says the news of The Times is wrong.
"How will we respond if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not fair and complete or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court, despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the inter-calary elections for a Congress responsible for Mr Trump?
If we do these tests, democracy will soon be going through a long desert.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my diplomatic residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and, 60 years later, she sent me to light candles from Sabath on that table with suastics.
With a legacy of these, how could you not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorans of the Rangers optimistic before the game with the Rapid of Vienna
The Rangers receive the Rapid of Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, following the impressive empatt in Spain with the Villareal at the beginning of the month, will leave them in a good position to qualify in Group G of the League of Europe.
A knee injury prevented the medium Graham Dorrans from making the first game of the era up to two goals with the Villareal, but he believes the Rangers will be able to use this result as a trampoline for higher flights.
"It was a good point for us because Villareal is a good team," said the 31-year-old player.
"We took the game with a positive mentality and won a point.
Perhaps we could have won near the end, but in global terms, the empathy was probably the most just result.
They were probably better in the first part but we turned around and dominated in the second part.
Thursday will be another great European night.
I hope we can win the three points. It will be a difficult game because they have achieved a good result in the last game but, with the support of the public, I am sure that we will give our best to achieve a positive result.
Last year was very hard, with all my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a good environment.
The team is good and the players are having fun; the training runs well.
I hope we can give our best, forget the past and achieve success."
Women are losing sleep with fear of this savings-reform account
Despite the fact that the survey participants have a clear idea of the type of care they intend to take advantage of, few people have talked to their relatives about the matter.
About half of the individuals surveyed in the Nationwide study referred to talking to their spouses about the cost of continued care.
Only 10% mentioned talking to children about the same subject.
"People want a family to take care of themselves, but they're not having this conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationalwide Life Insurance Branch.
Here's how to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not be able to prepare your family to take care of them if you do not let them know your wishes with due advance.
Work with your consultant and with your family, discussing where and how to receive care, since these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial consultant: Your consultant can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Their continuing care financing options may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid monetary valuation policy to help cover these costs or funding using their own savings, provided that these values are available.
Prepare legal documentation: Avoid legal battles.
Name a health care prosecutor, choosing a person of your trust to supervise your health care and ensure that professionals respect their wishes if they are prevented from communicating with them.
Consider also the establishment of an inquiry into your finances.
You will have to select someone you trust to make financial decisions for yourself, ensuring that your accounts will be paid if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you like to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Includes this information in a written plan to be prepared.
"Not only are financial issues at stake, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What is medication?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Prepare this plan."
Man targeted multiple times with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was targeted several times with an air pressure when he returned home after one night in the city.
The victim, in the home of the forty years, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was touched in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The agents described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a random act.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
Wounds don't mean life risk, and the police have asked for witnesses.
Sysmos and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, the authorities reported, and were expected to increase the number of deaths.
With the interrupted communications, the rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Dongala region, a zone north of Palu which is closer to the epicenter of magnitude 7,5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Central, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Dongala is a region that extends over 300 km from the coast, in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, with administrative status lower than that of a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of the province of Sulawesi Central, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
The extraction of nickel is also important in the province, but it mostly focuses on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the last hundred years, according to the Indonesian disaster management agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
A tsunami also hit the western part of Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Seismic Fire Ring, being regularly hit by sismos.
Here are some of the main sisms and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December a strong earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, originated a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong sismos reached the western coast of Sumatra, at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Island, along Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6,8 earthquake hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, originating in a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing almost 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake hit the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the Mentawai islands along Sumatra, disarming a tsunami with waves of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A little deep earthquake hit the region of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, spreading the destruction and panic among people who remembered the devastation caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time no tsunamis occurred, but more than 100 people died buried under the debris of the buildings.
2018: Big Sismos reached the tourist island of Lombok Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The sixes destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Alaskan governor and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault charges.
Palin, 29-year-old resident in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, interference in an investigation into domestic violence and detention resistance, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he pulled her off the phone.
Palin was pre-trially detained in Mat-Su's pre-trial detention centre, subject to a $500 bond, reported to KTUU.
He was present at the judge's Saturday, declaring himself "of course innocent," the station announced.
Palin faces charges for three class A crimes, which means he can be sentenced to a penalty of up to one year and fined at $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B crime, punishable by a day of chains and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges against Palin have been filed.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is to be decided by the Alaska Veterinary Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, interference with the complaint of a crime of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol in relation to the incident.
Your girlfriend accused him of obscuring his face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veteran associations after associating the child's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress resulting from her service in Iraq.
Sism and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died as a result of a earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
The electrical and communications networks have been cut off, hoping that the number of dead will rise in the next few days.
The earthquake reached the region of Sulawesi Central, northwest of the Indonesian capital, Jacarta.
They circulate videos on social networks showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people met for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Public ministry requests rare capital punishment for suspected terrorist attack in New York
The New York Public Ministry calls for the death penalty for Sayfillo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack that killed eight people in the city - a rare penalty that has not been executed in the state by a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, is accused of using a truck rented by the Home Depot to carry out an attack in October, a cyclist in West Side Highway, in the Manhattan Bay, cyclists and pedestrians.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intendedly" killed the eight victims and "intendedly" inflicted serious injuries, according to the notification requesting the death penalty, registered in the South Zone of New York.
Both charges can be punishable with the death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, the jury of a federal court accused Saipov of 22 crimes, including eight counts of murder at the service of organized crime, usually used by the Public Ministry in cases of organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack demanded a "considerable planning and premeditation", the prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed it as "atrocious, cruel and devious".
"Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci", refers to the notification.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade ago the South Zone of New York didn't ask for the death penalty for a charge.
The crime, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but the penalty was commuted to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced by conspiracy to commit acts of espionage in favor of the Soviet Union, two years earlier, during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to the court's documentation, Saipov, a natural Uzbek, did not show any remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told the investigators he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the accusation.
He also requested permission to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, referred to the police.
It was found innocent in relation to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's defense lawyers, said they were "of course disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to request the death penalty rather than accept a confession of guilt for life imprisonment, without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the plaintiffs not to request the death penalty.
Conservative Member states that NIGEL FARAGE should lead Brexit's negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the popular army" during a protest at the Conservative Congress.
UKIP's former leader said politicians should "feel the pressure" of Euro-Cetists, while one of Theresa May's members suggested that he should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative member Peter Bone said in the Birmingham protest that the United Kingdom "would have left" if Farage was Brexit's minister.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May in reconciling her deeply divided counterparts was underlined by the conservatives who advocated permanence, who organised a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has been debating to maintain his commitment plan, known as the Chequers Plan, against the attacks of Brexit's supporters, the defenders of permanence and the EU.
The Allies insist that it will continue to try to reach agreement with Brussels in spite of the protests, forcing the Euro-Cethetics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and their "chaos".
Mr. Bone said at the launch of the Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "end the Plan".
Bone suggested that Farage should have been entrusted with responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we would've left," he said.
Mr Wellingborough added: "I will continue to defend Brexit, but we should end the Plan."
Strengthening its opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in two World Wars to be subordinates.
We want to make the laws of our own country."
Bone rejected the allegations that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed ideas and intends to remain completely undisclosed."
Brexit's defender Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the event, saying to journalists: "I just say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not approve it, it is unpopular in our own party and with the militants who take the campaigns to the street and whom we owe our election.
Let the Cheques Plan fall and start listening."
In a message to Mrs. May, she added: "Only the prime ministers who know how to keep promises keep their jobs."
Farage said in the protest that politicians should "sensit the pressure" if they were to be prepared to betray the decision that came out of the 2016 referendum.
"This has become a matter of confidence between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"You're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them that they're not going to get rid of it."
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to press our political class, which is at the edge of betraying Brexit.
We want to mobilize the popular army of this country, which has given us the victory in Brexit and which will not rest until we become an independent, proud and self-governing United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the defenders of the stay left in Birmingham before organizing a two-hour commission in the city centre.
A crowd of activists placed bands with the message "Conservators against Brexit" after the group was released this weekend.
The representative of the Workers in the House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for the security problems they faced with applying the party in opening the convention.
"It is these people who tell us that they will have the computer systems and all the technology prepared for 'Canada more', for the free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit," he concluded.
Warren plans to "seriously" the possible candidacy to the President
The US Senator Elizabeth Warren says he will "seriously apply to the President" after the November elections.
Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about their future during a debate in that state on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is a candidate for the re-election in November against Mr. Republican Geoff Diehl, co-mandater of the Trump campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
It has been speculated that you will be able to face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with voters in the format of debate since the taking over of Trump.
One of the participants asked whether he was planning to apply for the presidency.
Warren replied that it is time for women to go to Washington to correct the problems of our government and this includes a woman at the top.
Arrest in the context of the murder of Wayde Sims, LSU Tigers
Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, announced on Saturday the arrest of a suspect in the case of the LSU Tigers basketball player's murder, Wayde Sims, on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson in a press conference at 11 a.m.
The police had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the images.
Yes, 20 years old, he was beaten near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title with a victory over Sebastian Vettel following orders from the team
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team orders played a central role in the race.
Leaving the pole position, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton behind while defending his position on the first two curves, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first to the boxes and made Hamilton face the traffic of the end of the platoon, which could have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the boxes one time and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton exceeded him after a renegade squeak, after which the Ferrari pilot dropped the inner part of the free track, at risk of disqualification after a double trajectory correction to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen left the last line of the grid and was in the seventh place at the end of the first round, on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race, changing tires very late, which would allow him to be fast in the final part, aiming to cross Kimi Raikkonen to finish in fourth place.
He finished coming to the boxes on the 44th round but failed to improve his pace in the last eight rounds, which allowed Raikkonen to end in a room.
"It's a hard day because Valteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real knight, letting me pass it.
The team did an exceptional job, which allowed us to finish in the first two positions," Hamilton said.
First body language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Feinstein on a commission Saturday because of his insistence on not revealing a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court of sexual abuse.
Speaking on a committee in West Virginia, the President did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Justice Commission, not commenting on what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "more, more malicious and false".
"See the beautiful thing that is happening in the Senate in the last days, see the rage, see how people are more, malicious and false," said Trump.
"When we see the leaks of information and communications and when they say 'oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, running away from you?
Remember her answer... did she disclose the document?
Oh, no.
The escape didn't leave me.'
Well, wait there.
The escape left us... no, it wasn't us," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with details of the charges against Kavanaugh sent by Ford in July and the escape took place in early September, but denied that the escape had left his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal his story," Feinstein told the Commission, according to The Hill.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I complied with her request."
But his dissident did not convince the President, who commented during the beginning of Saturday night: "You know, that was a bad body language.
Maybe it wasn't her, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the High Court, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats would be using the charges in their favor.
"They are determined to regain power by resorting to all means.
We see evil, evil, no interest in who can reach, who have to walk to seize power and control," said the President, according to the Mediate.
First Division: Dundee Stars defeated by Belfast Giants for 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals by the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars were redeemed from defeat on Friday in the game of the First Division against the Belfast Giants, winning the second hand by 5-3 on Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants have gained an initial advantage of two goals with Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier's endings.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie broke up for the house team before Dwyer put the Giants in front again.
François Bouchard pampered for Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald guarantee the team's victory.
It was the third defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had achieved a revolution on Friday night in Belfast, defeating Dundee for 2-1.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, having the Giants defeated the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal arose at the fourth minute (3:35) following a assistance from Kendall McFaul, with David Rutherford attending to Beauvilier increase the advantage four minutes later.
In a first brake period, Sullivan put the house team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt provided the tie to Cownie, at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants arrive at the first stage of leadership, marking their second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The house team reorganized and Bouchard repatriated with a mighty goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, guaranteeing victory by marking the fifth goal of the team in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who lost four of the last five games, receive Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air controller dies to help hundreds of passengers escape from earthquake
A Indonesian air controller has been hailed as a hero after dying to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers unloaded safely.
More than 800 people died and many still disappeared after a strong earthquake had reached the island of Sulawesi on Friday, originating in a tsunami.
Powerful replicas continue to undermine the region, leaving many inhabitants buried in the trash in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues having fled to save themselves, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post while the control tower was abdicating with violence at the airport of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri in Palu.
He remained focused to ensure that the 6321 Batik Air flight, which was then on the track, took off safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower, in front of the prominent collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation agency spokesman Yohannes Sirat said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported the Australian television channel ABC News.
We sent a Balikpapan helicopter to Kalimantan to evacuate him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"We were devastated with this news," he added.
However, the authorities fear that the number of deaths may reach thousands, referring to the disaster management agency in the country that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance is increasing, as there are many bodies buried by the trash that we have not yet been able to rescue," said the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six meters devastated Palu, where a collective funeral takes place on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft are transporting aid and maintenance to the place.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute ambulances arrive with bodies.
There's no drinking water.
The minimers are being picked up all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, responsible for the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross is in a race against time to help the survivors, but we do not know what we will find.
The current situation is really tragic, but it could be much worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday. According to CNN sources, he addressed the military forces at the site and said:
"I ask you to work day and night to complete evacuation operations.
At the beginning of this year, the island of Lombok in Indonesia was hit by earthquakes that killed more than 550 people.
Flight to Micronesia: Air Niugini reports now that there is a missing man after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that landed in a lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific, now reports that there is a missing man after reporting that all 47 passengers and the crew had been safely rescued from the plane to sink.
In a statement, Air Niugini stated that, from Saturday to afternoon, he could not confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger.
The area company claimed to be working with hospitals, researchers and local authorities to locate the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local ships helped save the other passengers and the crew after the plane landed in the water trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline has advanced that six passengers remain hospitalized on Saturday, all of them with a stable clinical picture.
We still do not know the cause of the fall or the exact sequence of events.
The U.S. Air Company and Navy were unanimous in saying that the plane failed to reach the track and became bitter in the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane was out of track.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was very low.
"It was the best thing that happened," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other people had managed to drag themselves with the water through the belt and get to the emergency exits of the plane to sink.
He told me that the ship's assistants had panicked and started screaming, and that he had suffered a small injury in his head.
According to the U.S. Navy, the sailors who were working on an improvement of a wet in the vicinity also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sinks at 30 meters (100 feet) of depth.
Based on data collected by the Aviation Safety Network in the last two decades, 111 people died in accidents with registered PNG airlines, but none involved Air Niugini.
Analyst explains the chronology of the night events in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its allegations on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlet, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used his cell phone records to reconstruct the movements of 20-year-old Quintom Tellis, and of the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of her death.
According to the newspaper Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have obtained location data from several phones confirming that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting the statements he had made earlier.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he hadn't been in town that day.
When the charge asked him if Tellis was telling the truth saying he was in his car that night, Sanford replied that he was lying because the car was in Nashville."
Another incongruity in Tellis's testimony indicated that she had claimed that she knew Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
Phone records indicated that they only knew each other a week ago.
Rowlett said that, some time after the death of Chambers, Tellis deleted SMS messages, phone calls and contact information from Chambers.
"It's ruined her from her life," said Hale.
The defence should begin to present its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he was hoping that the trial would begin to be examined by the jury at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to change the negative tone of the genre by filling in your positive message music.
Bristol's The High Breed Group claims that the hip hop has deviated from its roots of political and social criticism.
They want to go back to these roots and return popularity to conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Refugees and Common have attended a recent rebirth in the United Kingdom thanks to the intervention of other interpreters, such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
Love New York processes marriage by dismissal through a "racist" SMS message
A New Yorker's lover is processing a marriage for discriminatory dismissal after she has been deceived into receiving a mother's text message complaining that "it was another black".
The couple denied the charges of racism, claiming that the trial was an act of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, a mother of two children, showed some fear when he discovered that the new lover Giselle Maurice was black when she presented herself for her first working day in 2016.
"I can't believe... more than one black," Lynsey Plasco-Faxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice... twice.
According to the New York Post, when she realized from her pocket, a "embarrassed" Lynsey Plasco-Faxman fired Giselle Maurice claiming the bad performance of previous African-American love and was waiting for a Filipino love.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her only day of work and sent to Uber's house.
Now, Giselle Maurice is processing the marriage and asking for a compensation of 350 USD/day for the six-month period for which she had been chosen without contract.
"I want to show them that they can't be punished," he said to the Post on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination."
The couple rejected the allegations of racism, saying that saying goodbye to Giselle was perfectly logical because they feared they could not trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife sent her something she really didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racist people," Joel Plasco said to the Post.
"Would your children trust someone who had treated them badly?
Your newborn son?
I don't believe it."
By calling the "extortion" process, Plasco said his wife had been a mother only two months ago and had to deal with "a very difficult situation."
"Are you going to chase someone like that?
It's not very nice," the investment banker added.
While legal proceedings are taking place, the court of public opinion was swift in condemning the couple on social networks, criticising their behavior and reasoning.
New letter reveals that the editors of Paddington feared that readers might not identify themselves with a speaking bear
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book had been accepted, commented: "It's hard to get into the skin of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very fun to know this now, after Paddington has been so successful."
He commented that his father, who worked as a BBC camera operator before being inspired by a small bear to play writing the children's book, would not have breast-feeded if the book had been rejected, and added that the 60-year anniversary of the publication had a bitter taste given his death last year.
About Paddington, who described as "a very important member of our family", said that his father was very proud of his success.
"He was a modest man, not a person given to gabarolica," he said.
"But as Paddington was so real to him, it was as if he had a successful son: we were proud even when the fact is not ours.
I think that's how I saw Paddington's success.
Despite being the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to my cell phone.
Soon after landing, the daughter had been taken by emergency to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where the doctors fought in vain to save her life.
"Nad often called to say that the situation was really bad and that there was no chance of survival," Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then Nad called to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
Together.
The medications that the doctors had given you to keep your heart working were slowly giving up and getting out of your system.
I've been dead for a while, and all his organs were stopping.
I had to stay there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to tell you."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane together with other foreign passengers to test why she was going through.
"No one knew," he said.
"I've always heard low-headed.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt a huge compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women put cards on a bridge to avoid suicide
Two women who lost loved ones who committed suicide fight to prevent others from following the same path.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set cards on a Welsh bridge with motivation messages and phone numbers that people can use to receive support.
Tyler, Sharon Davis' son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want no father to feel how I feel every day," he said.
Sharon Davis, 45-year-old resident in Lydney, said the son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said he was lighting the room."
However, he gave up his job before he died because he had "dumped in the darkness".
In 2014, Tyler was found dead by his 11-year-old brother.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always worried about a possible impact."
Sharon Davis created the mails "so that they know that there are people who are available to help and who can talk to, or who is not a friend.
Don't close on your own, you have to talk."
Kelly Humphreys, a long-term friend of Sharon Davis, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, very shortly after her mother-in-law died.
"I didn't say I was sad or depressed," he said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in their behavior.
On Christmas Day, it was a trap. When the kids opened the presents, they didn't even look at them."
He said his death traumatized them a lot, but it's something they have to overcome: "Destroy a family.
No one's indifferent.
But we all have to keep living and fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake with the start of the FBI investigation
"I thought that in terms of what I was asking for - a time-defined research - we could be more united," Jeff Flake said on Saturday, moving that he was afraid that the committee would be "disarmoring" against a rooted party impasse.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Its repulsiveness is just a temporary matter.
The middle elections are only five weeks away. On 6 November, if, as expected, the Republicans have bad results, they will see their attempts to elect their candidate to the Frustrated Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has contacted the senators to press them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met the woman Ashley, Bush's personal secretary at that time.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not true that Kavanaugh is able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to cast the ballot and confirm his seat in the Supreme Court.
Number of deserters in North Korea decreases during Kim's regime
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean deserters for North Korea has decreased from the rise to the power of Kim Jong-un seven years ago.
In quoting data from the Ministry of South Korea's Unification, Park Byeong-seug indicated that 1127 deserts occurred last year compared to the 2706s of 2011.
Park stated that the stricter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that smugglers of people ask for more money, were the main factors.
Pyongyang didn't make any public statements.
Generally speaking, South Korean citizenship is granted to the vast majority of the deserters in North Korea.
Seoul reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The majority flees to China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the deserters to be illegal and non-refugees migrants, and it is frequent to repatriate them.
Relations between North Korea and South Korea (technically still in war) have improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the negotiations on denuclearisation that are on an impasse.
The talks took place after the historic meeting in June between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, in general, to cooperate in the creation of a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the U.S. for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, it is impossible for us to take the first steps towards unilateral disarmament," Ri said in a speech at the United Nations Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is hysterical and unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the minority in the Chamber, said that Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, was hysterically and mentally unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't stop thinking that if a woman had acted like this, it would be called hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Commission on Thursday
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all sexual abuse to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh made a statement of emotional openness, sometimes in a harsh and soluble voice, when he spoke about his family and the years of high school.
He also explicitly accused the Committee's Democrats, calling for the allegations made against him of "gross and conspiracy murder" organised by liberals who were being beaten by Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said to believe that Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he has no conditions to serve in the Supreme Court given his preconceived behaviour against the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself with his statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
When he was asked whether he would try to challenge the effective appointment of Kavanaugh and if the Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
"What I can say is that if you lie to Congress or the FBI, you do not meet the conditions to be in the Supreme Court, or even to serve in your current court," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge in the D.C. District Court.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was afraid of Kavanaugh's potential opinions against the Affordable Care Act (the most known by Obamacare) or the Roe vs Wade case, given the reputation of being a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh raised questions about the possibility of withdrawing certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not a time to choose someone hysterical and preconceived to the Supreme Court and to hope that we will be happy with the decision," Pelosi said.
Women need to know how to control their emotions.
It's a legitimate diatribe, months and years of anger to cross, and it can't unravel without crying.
"We prayed when we called," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do you think?"
A woman with an executive position in a company helped me enormously. She told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but she had created a technique. When she was angry and started to cry, she said to the person she was talking to, "Don't think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And it kept going.
And I thought to myself... it's brilliant," continued Mrs. Steinem.
Tears are accepted when they express anger because, in a more common context, they are misunderstood.
I remember perfectly that, in an old job in an office dominated by men in whom I cried of inexplicable anger, being caught by an older woman's neck - an unfriendly manager who terrorized me a little - and literally dragged to the stairs to hear it say
"You never let them see you cry."
"They don't know if you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're going to be happy they've managed to affect you."
Patricia Schroeder, the Democratic Congressman of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his candidacy for the presidents.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship on board a ship called Monkey Business and gave up his candidacy, an extremely frustrated Patricia Schroeder did not see why she could not apply herself to the presidents.
"It wasn't a very serious decision," he told me to laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates and another one was simply unnecessary.
There was someone who called the situation "The Snow White and the Seven Years."
Given its late entry, the fundraising was one of the desired ones, and he swore that he would only enter the race if he could earn $2 million.
A battle condemned to defeat.
He found that some of his supporters only gave him $250, even though they had given $1,000 to male candidates.
"Do you think I have the right to a discount?" he asked.
When he announced that he would not enter a formal campaign, the emotions came to the top - thank you for the people who had supported him, frustration with a system that raised so many obstacles to fund-raising and bringing the message to the electors, instead of the delegates, and anger against sexism - and tears arose.
"Until she seemed depressed," Patricia Schroeder recalled when she spoke about the reaction of the media.
"I'd have thought Kleinex was my business sponsor.
What would you write in my epitaph now?
"She cried?"
How the trade war between the U.S. and China can be beneficial to Beijing
The first rescue of the trade war between the U.S. and China was overwhelming, and although the end of the conflict is not visible, in the perspective of the experts, the departure of the two countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, fired the first warning at the beginning of the year when taxing important Chinese imports including solar, steel and aluminium panels.
This week was the scene of a significant worsening of the situation with the new rates to affect goods worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), taxing in reality half of all the goods sent by China to the United States.
Beijing has always declined in the same currency, with a recent rise in rates of between 5 and 10 per cent for US goods worth $6 billion.
China has committed itself to following the steps of the U.S. and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will slow down in the near future.
Making Washington back would mean meeting the demands, but showing a public subservience to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes good use of its trumps, the pressures imposed by the U.S. trade war can positively sustain China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"In fact, the fact that a Washington or Beijing political decision could result in an economic crisis in both countries is much more dangerous than observers could have ever anticipated," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher dedicated to Asia's study at the Center for New American Security, a group of reflections.
Foreign Minister says Syria is ready to return refugees
Syria claims to be prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks help for the reconstruction of a country that has been devastated for more than seven long years of war.
In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's conditions are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have left because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily life and livelihood.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people who have remained in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would receive a good deal of help for the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or help from the countries sponsoring the revolt.
Europe wins in Ryder Cup in Paris
The selection of Europe beats the U.S. and wins the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National around Paris, France.
The United States has now accumulated six consecutive victories on European soil since the last time they won the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe was once again victorious after the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The North American star Phil Mickelson, who has shown serious difficulties during almost all the tournament, sent the tea of departure to the water in the hole 16, par 3, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all its rounds, becoming 1 of the 4 players to get 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament started in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 for the worst-class player in the selection of Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The best-classed player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 for Ian Poulter from England in which he may have been his last participation in the Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia has become the most prized European of all tournaments with 25.5 points of career.
"It's not my habit to cry, but today I couldn't contain myself.
It was a tough year.
I can't stop thanking Thomas for choosing and believing me.
I am extremely happy that we have defeated the cup.
It was all a team effort and I am happy to have been able to help," said an emotional Garcia after the victory of Europe.
Pass the word to your compatriot Jon Rham who defeated the legend of the American golfer, Tiger Woods, for 2-1 in singulars on Sunday.
"It is impossible to describe the pride I feel I have overcome Tiger Woods. I grew up to see him play," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record on Ryder Cup.
Invulnerable statistical values of one of the largest players of all time with 14 major winning titles and only beat by Jack Nicklus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had a high-calibre performance throughout the tournament, the remaining elements of the U.S. Selection were discussed for reaching the fairway.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, spoke after his team's disappointing performance. "I'm proud of them.
This morning, we managed to put some fear into Europe.
Let's fight.
My congratulations to Thomas.
He's a big captain.
All 12 players were excellent.
We will reorganise and I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission to move forward.
I like many of these 12 players and I'm proud to be your captain.
I have to get my hat off the other team.
They were better."
