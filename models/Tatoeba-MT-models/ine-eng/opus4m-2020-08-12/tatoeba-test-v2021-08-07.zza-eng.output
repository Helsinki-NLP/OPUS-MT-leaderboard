What's the big deal?
You're hot?
Are you sure you want to go to bed?
You've lost your mind.
I don't care.
Did you get Tom's vaccine?
If you don't mind me, will you?
Is the heat cooler than the blue?
You're welcome!
That's a long time.
I'll be fine.
Good and big.
Don't you think we're going to have a good time?
And it's all in the new world.
Dicki's like, "I don't want a nickname."

What's the deal?
Don't you know what we're talking about?
Shut down this bitch?
Where's the locker?
I'm sorry!
I'm new.
Eza Tomiya doesn't care.
I don't like the balls.
It's just that I can see it.

I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.
I've got a big step.
She's in love with me.
It's the only way to get the pay off.

I don't know what to do.
Zey, you know what you're doing.
I like to take my feet off.
The network is not a free network connection.
It's not a sign of wine.
It's a good idea to have sex.
The mass is almost there!
It's the last time I've ever met anyone.
He is neither blind nor blind.
Oh, my God.
That's not it, Tom.
I don't know.
I don't think it's gonna hurt.

It's the coolest cloud or the coolest thing to do.
It's the one that edited it.
What's the matter with you?
Do you think Tom would shut the fuck up?
It's what we're talking about.
Ez Tomra you don't have.
I don't know what you're talking about.
It's just that we don't know what to do.
That's not what it is.
It's no secret.
The European Union has no idea what it's like.
I don't want you to come.
It is the euro, and it won't hurt.
I'm sorry.
You can't help but feel the heat.
It's my birthday, it's my birthday.
I'm sorry, it's the worst meal I've ever had.
He's a good man.
You don't know exactly what to do.
You'll be fine, you'll be fine.
It's Tommy's offer.
That's the girl.
It's okay, Mr. Tomi.
It's my pleasure to be with you.
I'm also avenged of the poor peyhesyaya.
I'm revenged and sorry for the peyhesyaya.
We don't know if it's gonna happen again.
Maybe you don't want to.
Maybe you didn't like it.
It's good to meet you.
I don't know.
It's the only time you've known me.
It's too late to get started.
It's a funny joke.
I'm so sorry.
Close it will close it.

There's something going on.
It's just that I'm going to leave you alone.
It's a joke.
It's from the tortoise.

He's having a good time.
I'm warning you. Are you okay?
That's it!
You're fucking her, aren't you?
I'm sorry.
It's just a drink.
He's been trying.
He's got a tougher idea of what he's up to.
He's right there with me.
He's with me and he's with me.
It's not my turn.
It's not me, it's me.
That's what it's all about.
He's got it, he's got it.
It's your turn.
You've seen the door.

Well, I don't think so.
You're writing.
It's my husband's fault.
We've got a real rock rock.

Don't I kiss?
Did Tom get any more?
Tom's on the phone?
Tom Zisto?
Who's the key?
It's the end of the snow.
It's too late.
He said it was Tom and Mary.
I'm not sure Tom's gonna hurt you.
It's just that it's not my fault.
It's gonna end.
I'm sorry.
It's my fault.
Who are you going to give us?
We're in a mess.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Oh, come on.
The heart.

Don't worry about it.
No information available.
Cassie didn't do the press.
I couldn't believe it.
Maybe I don't pay for it.
It's okay.
Not too shabby.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's okay.
That's what it's all about.
I don't know who I am.
Red, made of fea'm.
Call goes wrong.
I can't believe it.
I don't know.
Right-hand, left-hand..., pear pack.

You're almost there.
It's a nia pixil.
I don't know.
I don't think so.
It's us, it's us, it's us.

I'm on my way.
Don't you dare!
The manager may not be empty.
It's not the summer.
No, it's our guy.
That's not what it is.
Tom Niyo.
You're right, aren't you?
No, you don't.
You're the only one in the town of Liliken.
I'll be right back in the morning.
That's why he's here.
It's no big deal.
And what do you mean by that?
It's okay.
And I'd like to have some cream.

You're too drunk to drink and drink.
That's what I'm talking about.
It's like he's in a coma.
After all, I had a good paw.
I'm in a good paw.
Anyway, I'm sure you'll appreciate it.
I don't know if you're gonna know.
It's my funeral order.

I'll be right back.
It's a good drink.
Don't worry.
Made Tomi beat.
You're welcome.
You're welcome.
Give me a welcome.
He's the one who's got the money.
I'm sure you're all right.
It's gonna be over.
It's my secret.
That's what I'm talking about.
I don't want to go anywhere.
It's the coldest part of my life.
It's all right.
My berya is a meat.

This is the time.
Oh, my God, Tom.
He knows what I'm talking about.
You're the one who hit me.
I've had enough toma to cry.
It's my due date.
Made him feel better.
Is that what I'm saying?
What time is it?
Did you get the wind?
It's not like I'm going to have to go.
Is that you?
That's all right?
Or am I empty?
Did you ever stop?
Are you sure Tomdo's way?
Euro to yourself?
What's your name, or what's your name?
Who's with you?
What I drink is green, it's hot.
What's going to happen?
What, are you kidding me?
"Do you have a boyfriend?" "It's time!"
Are you a kid of a bitch?
Is that a safe cat you know?
Do you want to hide that?
Did the crowd get killed?
Does the shadow of a blanket wear?
Who did Tom hide his face?
How much is the eye key?
What's the matter?
Do we have a Tia?
We're sweating, aren't we?
Is that what we're doing?
About where?
At the price of the place?
Does that have a place?
We're a boy?
He's got no idea what he's talking about, and he's got killed.
Where's the cow?
It's hot in there, isn't it?
What about Tom Boston?
What's the matter with you?
Don't you know what it's like to spend the summer?
Don't you know how you're doing?
What's the big deal?
Are you sure you don't want to go?
Is that what you're talking about?
And, Ez wai Tomiya, Ez and her!
It's like a large, warm rock.
You're welcome.
The peaks of the blue fall off.
The heat of the red.
You don't drink in it.
Is that a nino?
That's the weight.
It would've killed him.
You're an edifice.
You don't have to edit it because it's great.
It's been a long time, isn't it?
Are you all right?
That's what you're talking about.
It's the right thing to do.
You don't have to drink.
You're welcome.
You're still alive, aren't you?
You're not going anywhere, are you?
It's Japanese.
