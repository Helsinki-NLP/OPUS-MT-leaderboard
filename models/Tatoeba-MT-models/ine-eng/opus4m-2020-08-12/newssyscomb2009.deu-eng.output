Triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria, totaling 29 percent
A significant weakening of the two parties of the former Great Coalition and a clear strengthening of the right-wing populist parties led, after the first preliminary results, to the pre-eminent parliamentary elections from Sunday in Austria.
In particular, the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffers from a particular loss, where the position of former President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the verge.
On the contrary, the head of the Federation for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Kärntner Landeshauptmann Jörg Haider, is armed for a triumphal return to the federal policy.
According to the results so far, social democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest force in the country by 29.8%, but compared to the last elections in 2006, it loses 5.5% of the votes.
Even worse, the EPO cut off, which loses almost nine percent of the votes by 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the post-war history of Austria, and especially in the People's Party that requested the pre-elections, this is a truly catastrophic result.
Even at the beginning of July, when the EVP had emerged from the coalition, the People's Party had a clear lead before the SPÖ.
However, voters have probably punished the party for failing the government.
In the first reactions to the results, speculations were made about the possible resignation of the vice-president and former Chancellor Wilhelm Mulder.
Observers believe that this could be the case at an extraordinary meeting of the Bureau of the Party on Monday.
Such a development would probably pave the way for the most likely way out of the electoral round, i.e. for a renewal of the large coalition from SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of the two legal populist parties - the Liberals (FPÖ) received 18 per cent, the 11 per cent of the votes - but at the same time the Social Democrats gave expression to their fears, the year 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party with the populist talks (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it had split off from the BZÖ) with regard to a common government, which had even brought about sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Clearly, Jörg Haider has already stated that he is ready to work with each party and is going from one return to Vienna to the Austrian federal policy.
In addition, the Greens party was also involved in Parliament, which suffered slight losses and was left in fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four-percentile threshold and therefore did not enter Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool off
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists who were accused in India of the illegal collection of coppers, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg may find a certain cooling of the Czech-India relations.
This was highlighted by the Minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian colleague Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not clear, then it will certainly be cooled," he said after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks, in judicial matters the executives can only take serious action.
Despite all this, he argued that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of the charge and received a fine that the central government wants with the local government in Dardjiling, in whose case the case lies.
"His problem could be explained," said the minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years' imprisonment, it would be in Mukherdshi's view best if he went to a higher court.
He could thus seek release for bail and wait for his sentence in freedom, as the Minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had also spoken in negotiations.
"He recommends a summons to a higher court, then comes an appeal for him," said the head of the Czech Diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to point out to the convicted "competent legal support", the Minister of India said.
At the same time, he said that such help would already be offered to them by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India, which have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also say so," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, he confirmed, so the Czech Press Agency ČTK, in front of his partner, the Czech Republic was of great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider it a big mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists," he said.
One answer to the question of whether he has received the commitment from the Indian side to deal with the matter is missing the minister.
"I've already been promised quite a lot," he just said.
A Czech directs over the ring around the sea floor
It comes with an electronic map, shown on Australia and adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it also the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the thirty-headed team of the UN Division for Oceans and Oceans.
His chief, the division director, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, pursues the interpretation and complements it.
Here is the rule of work and enthusiasm.
The seabed has so far brought only a few known worlds that are rich in natural sources.
Here is to find oil, more ore and other non-growing raw materials, but also unknown living organisms, which, for example, bear the key to developing a drug against cancer.
A seabed larger than the mainland
Today, the Iranian states have strongly announced their claim to the new maritime areas.
According to a UN convention, they make use of their rights, which they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is especially the area of the so-called continental shelf, which is often up to a few hundred kilometres away from the shore of a country into the sea.
This country has, according to the Convention, an exclusive claim to all sources of continental shelf life.
"Simplicity expressed as a continental shelf is considered the part of the sea floor and its soles, which represents a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It exceeds the borders of the coastal sea, often also the borders of two hundred sea miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," Mikulka explains.
The request submitted by the Commission country concerned to establish the outer limits of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation, which is based on many cost-intensive studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical support to the Commission.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have had success," Mikulka adds.
An international echo was recently seen as Australia's success, which as the first country was able to significantly expand its marine areas.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the extension of the sea floor, which was granted to the country last week by the Commission, is about 1.6 million square kilometres, i.e. about six times the size of the country.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profits that they will receive in the future from the use of the sea floor will, as they promise, have an invaluable value.
Other countries will gradually submit their applications.
You can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the "Montego Bay Agreement".
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor, which is referred to by the Convention as the "common heritage of mankind", begins.
Then a state no longer has a special position.
The right to promote in this area confers an international institution set up by the Convention.
"But the sea floor is not a gold miner's country," says Director Mikulka with some overhaul and adds that "its individual areas are legally defined and the system is contractually anchored".
Czech in the Pacific
Part of the seabed is also part of the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other states of the former East Block within the framework of the interocean metal joint organization.
This was achieved in 1991 by virtue of the Convention, as well as the investors of some less states, the status of a so-called 'rail-breaking investor'.
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The sea floor is divided there, it's a kind of tatra on the sea floor.
"A total area of 75,000 square kilometres can be promoted there.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," said another lawyer, Inder Pakshi Ryan.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev Division brings such a concretion as a pattern.
She remembers a small potato or, with some fantasy, the telling scheme that the legend after the golem brought to life.
German Special Forces were on site at hostage release
The Egyptian government had asked for help in solving the hostage crisis from Germany - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they did not come to use.
The circumstances of the 11th liberation in Egypt by European tourists are becoming more and more detailed.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue action.
Thus, both Federal Defence specialists and GSG 9 officials were the Flyersstaff of the Federal Police, the Federal Crimean Office and the logistics experts of the Technical Assistance Agency at the place of release.
As speakers of the ministries continued to announce on Monday evening, however, the German forces were not needed because the hostages let their prisoners run and flee when they had seen signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian Government has adopted the aid offered by Germany to involve them as local support forces.
"It was fortunately not," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of Interior.
The attackers had taken the group from the five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and eight Egyptian supporters in southern Egypt on 19 September.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad were dragged away.
The identity of the hostages remained unclear until the end as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
The equipment has now arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the free hostages were in the obstetrics of the German Embassy.
He did not speak for details of the release.
In Berlin there was no information at first when they returned to Germany.
According to the "Picture" schedule, the five vacationers and the special forces are scheduled to fly out with an airbus of the air weapon and meet in Germany on Tuesday.
US House of Representatives Refuses Rescue Package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has almost failed the 700 billion-dollar heavy rescue package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones went deep.
With 206 to 227 votes, the US House of Representatives rejected the Government's bailout package for financial markets.
Despite all the appeals by US President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the programme to end the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the proponents had no doubt tried to convince the critics of the 700 billion dollars heavy package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called for a vote, even though the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to obtain political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet entered," he admitted.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones fell by more than six percent or by 600 points.
There were reasons for the investors' concern that the state rescue package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote so that, after the failure became known, he could fall back down again.
Experts are now counting on the international financial markets with further severe turbulence.
In order to enter into force the programme must be approved by both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers list increasing booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
For travel bookings for the coming months, sales in comparison to the previous year have increased significantly according to a study - for the winter season even by more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic outlooks, the travel list of the Germans remains unscathed according to a study.
In the bookings for the winter season, the travel offices recorded a 31% increase in turnover compared to the previous year, as the German Travel Association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the study by the market research institute GfK, booking numbers have already increased for the autumn months.
Thus, the revenue supplement of the travel offices for October amounted to about 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV reported.
These results are based on GfK figures that evaluate monthly booking data of 1200 German travel offices and account for the total market.
The travel bookings were recorded by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar rate, in particular, trips to the United States were requested, the DRV reported.
Here the booking growth is about a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the domestic fields of the Germans, were particularly sought-after destinations.
Special holiday trips are high in the course, said DrV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the increasing costs of energy and food, the costs here are "better calculated for customers than for individual organized holidays".
For example, consumers could save money through early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months have also been very well booked, so that there will be a return to the previous year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who took a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time in October
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless loop, beer from liters-krügen and promise in designer-dirndln.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronsucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is a blonde, TV moderator and wears a customized Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is second hand.
But one thing connects us: Nearly three minutes on the map, the photographers are already crashing on us and cutting the memory cards full - very flattering and that on my first visit.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to fulfill its purpose.
As Wiesn-Touri and actually north of the White World Quaker, the feeling of well-being remained in circulation to date.
But only once did it arrive on the Theresian way, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears dirt or leather hats; no eyelids or painfully touched - everything is completely normal.
The strange look at the shock banana stand only picked up my scratches.
A monk reminds me that I would have wrongly bound the shorts: "Links host free, midwife, forgive right, lean back."
Homely, I framed the loops from the back to the left.
"Fix," she said and laughed.
Others make less effort for subtle flirting techniques and wear simple filter hats on which "To drink to get dressed!" stands and pulls the naked back against an uninvited one.
The young man with the exhibitionistic attitudes called Bob, comes from England and also visits the October party for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long- dragged "oooo".
That's what he tells me after he got rid of his previously drunk measure.
Right next to one of these hydrants, everyone thinks he's a garbage dump.
So Bob's one of those famous wild boars.
Others do not have the luck of getting rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening Sanitaries in Sharen run over the fortress that needs to take care of the poor sugars.
The nurses always appear in the rudel - every time four to one drag a covered stretch from tent to tent.
This works like with most Wiesn visitors: Empty, fully back.
You can't see who's under the plan in the Promille sarg.
"These are the things that goarnimmer packs," one of the sanitaries called me on request and disappeared in the basement.
Name of the victim of an accident announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in the hospital after being assaulted by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, a resident of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon at Shenfield Road in the city centre.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romeford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident because of his suspicion of light driving.
Meanwhile, he was released for bail.
Turkey expands the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey tried to join the European Union, the European authorities were interested in entering Turkey's backyard.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just once 20 steps within Asia, is one of the finest relics of this failed, imperial pursuit.
The Hydarpasha Railway Station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo Renaissance style.
That's at least what the tour guide tells you.
The building sits at the end of the train station with a tower at every corner of the front and thus looks like some provincial German Town Hall.
The stone is fucking.
The whole building is falling apart.
But once you're inside the enveloped driver card switch, there's no doubt about the arrogance of the project, whose most Western access was.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolian-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was a late toddler in the imperialist game, had to implement its ambitions to dominate the Middle East, through a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperialist projects won during the first world war.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence by Arabs and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, created by the insurmountable limits of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces drove out of Egypt and forced the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there were also bad news for the Hyderpasha Railway Station.
In 1917 an ammo flew into the air, and the artificial roof was destroyed.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has been slowly decayed, largely passed from history.
Today, however, this railway line serves, at least symbolically, as a gateway to Anatolia and to all the east of it, to highlight the extension of the diplomatic horizon of Tükei.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the ACP, has introduced a very new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions created by the borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
A policy of convergence now prevails.
Significantly, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to be able to evaluate the core data of this new foreign policy, I have stepped up my night trip to the Turkish capital of Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the ACP, the Turkish MEP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after an excellent ride on tracks that produced the same step of the old world in the well-known documentation "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is seen as a new city, for the new global state project to return to the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, known for its Islamic roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity
This has triggered some suspicions in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the AKP’s headquarters, a specially constructed ultra-modern stone and steel construction, in a developing suburb surrounded by semi-finished shopping malls and cages in which middle managers, both men and women, met to complete the first shops of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a central right-wing politician from almost every other political party in Europe.
Pull, tie, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
"The purpose of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbours.
The Cold War was an exception," he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its back country.
Today she has to look east and west at the same time.
There is neither one nor the other.
She had to do both.
"But of course Turkey could ever," I asked, "are you forced to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "doesn't want to make this decision."
He then raised a point that almost everyone I spoke to here said almost routinely: Turkey's relations, not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message appears to be, in the transferred sense, Europe as a whole on flat-track railways to the east towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpashas Railway Station, after another night largely sleepless, I thought of these two German lords Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had been assigned to the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, be in the hands of Turkey.
And when I waited at the station for the ferry to bring me back over the Bosporus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
At the time, at least there seemed to be little doubt about which continent should have a claim on this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Chor.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus the following year.
He was meant for young people up to 21 years, but when the choir last sang in 1979, some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological form changer) stood for the willingness and ability of the choir to attack any piece of music presented to him, whether it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with a full orchestra.
The musical diversity of such a young choir was often surprising, always exciting, and stood alone thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never left.
How often death kept us talking about "the music for ourselves".
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in the music.
So it's singing!"
His kind of leadership was absolutely clear and precise, but never exaggerated.
No matter how high the musical level was, he always demanded a higher one.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any leader had been beaten to death by the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the last 40 years, I've been writing criticisms for over a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say that I've never been disappointed by a single one - often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated the conductors who, according to his words, simply "entered home with one or two well-known sheepmen in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your reputation for William Woodruff (September 25, 1946), you wrote that "in 1946 he took over the teaching of economic history in Oxford and in 1950 received a Houblon-Norman Research Fellowship ... while at the same time he studied for a BSC, MA and a doctoral degree.
This is a conclusion from a author's remark in Woodruffs book "Outside of Nab End", however it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at Nottingham University and during that time he wrote a doctoral work on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, who was later published in 1958 as the "British rubber industry".
He was in the United States in 1950-1951 under a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
`I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino 'Flamenco and Life' because his photographs are fantastic in black and white, in documentary style.
They made me pay attention to them because of their simplicity and the power they radiate, as they always treat the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to find the magical moments.'
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda began marketing the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large interior space, this large-scale limousine offers an even greater size.
In addition, the technical fineties that make it possible to save even more comfortable driving and gasoline.
Changes before the forthcoming revolution.
So is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new Jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made in this large limo are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics should be highlighted.
However, before you start analyzing the new model, you have to say that this new jazz appears six years later, after the first generation had appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda was able to renew this model for a shorter time compared to the other manufacturers.
Although the Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon with regard to its sales on the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where Jazz is the most sold car in 2002 and also in 2008.
After Jazz appeared on the market, about a million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase the sale of the new jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83 000 jazz models in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10,000 cars, 17% of the expected growth on the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, since 2002, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz models. These are 6.7% of the total sales to Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the heads of the branch in Spain expect to be able to sell 2,000 Jazz models per year.
More precisely, it allows the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model to mask the sale decline in Spain.
In fact, brand leaders hope to complete the year with total sales of 22,000 models. This is 4 000 cars less than in 2007, a 16% reduction.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain over the previous year (1.6%) to 1.8%.
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda puts on the appearance of a new model.
This is insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 meters, the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 models per year throughout the world.
According to the market estimates of the Japanese producer, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed on the Old Continent and Japan.
The publication of the Insight on the Market is foreseen for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters ), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axles is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has become 5 centimeters larger.
The height, however, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility programme and on the other, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the previous Jazz model.
The capacity of the luggage compartment, which has a double load system, also reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres greater than the capacity of the luggage compartment of the first generation.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4 litre petrol engine, as the capacity of the Honda Jazz case room with a 1.2 litre petrol engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, other than the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility to install panoramic windows, improved access to seats is offered.
The opening angle of the rear doors is 80 degrees, with the first Jazz having only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 engines running: 1,2 and 1.4 liters.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which allows low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, excellent technical performance and at the same time provides torque-intensive performance for the entire engine life.
The first version with 1.2 liters achieves the power of 90 PS in 6,000 rotations with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This gasoline engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 PS - has 5.3 litres of petrol consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the predecessor engine that reached 83 PS in the previous generation, he is now able to arrive at 100 PS.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litres of petrol consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
'Auto-Biene', avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan was inspired by nature this time, more precisely, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight returns to the bee’s tantrum and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers from the technical development center of the Nissan Motor Co. have developed these small robots in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology-PR and R&D-Brand Management, the BR23C is an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety sign.
This robot is intended to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped flight, which is very similar to the Nissan safety sign.
But the most important are the facets of the bees, which can see over an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, allowing them to fly uninterruptedly in their personal airspace without interruption.
To reflect the round outlook, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
It notes obstacles that are in front of the BR23C at a distance of up to two meters and are in the 180-degree radius, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a custom microprocessor, which is translated directly into a signal to prevent the collision
At a time when obstacle is observed, the little robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change the direction by turning its wheels around 90o or even larger angle to avoid collision.
The biggest difference to any other system is that this switchover is absolutely instinctive.
If not, the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles,' says Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the leading engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot can't either go up or down, but can't cover; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in an infinite way, as the bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and braking functions to prevent collisions by the small robot.
This device only needs a few seconds to process the information and act on these details.
It does not require either the information or the intuitive logic of the maneuvers made, so it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of the storage space.
This sounds surprising, but it is not about the GBs and not even the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in developing technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology to introduce Nissan to the series cars in the next ten years.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and longer than a variety of lithium ion batteries.
Another possible use of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system through satellite to avoid obstacles to the road when driving to the target.
She's on the move before she's loaded with a mortgage.
It must be noted that the US Ministry of Finance, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and in order to avoid the development of the US citizens in mortgage stories of allegedly eligible banks, an entertaining and informative game for Internet surfers has been developed: 'Bad Credit Hotel', it says.
Or maybe the 'Hotel of Bad Credit' or the other.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially of its receptionist is to consider one, two, or three times whether it is the time to ask no credit.
And above all, where you can do it, which is probably also the goal of the game.
She certainly has useful information, but without details.
This is more a page for the teenagers than a place for all spectators.
What happens when the game is expanded?
Well, if there's a dreamy room in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house.
Morgan Stanley provides her capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) to its company, which would be the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of its capital, a renewal that is due to a strong case of its stock exchange rate.
One week after a provisional agreement was made public, the two banks explained that MUFG 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's stocks will buy at a uniform price of $25.25, which amounts to a total amount of $3 billion.
The accepted price is below 19% of the price of the share on 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will secure a 10% profit and can be resold at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley explained that the global business is being carried out on the basis of a single average price of 29 dollars, i.e. 28% above the current price.
However, Morgan Stanley's share dropped by 6.79% to 23.07 dollars against 17.00 GMT.
'This strategic connection is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of Morgan Stanley to the status of a holding bank', said John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, allowing him to expand his business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Its connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the largest names of Wall Street to take a much more cautious attitude than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been changed over the last few days: Last Monday, Morgan had just explained that it would sell up to 20% of its shares for about $8.5 billion to Japan.
'A week ago', in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of the MUFG, 'we thought that participation would consist entirely of tribal property.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves.
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% for its Morgan Stanley shares below their price value.
And the business will be provided with a reduction in profit by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that in one year, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential shares into stocks if the latter are exchanged over the sales value by more than 50% within a given period, i.e. approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will enable him to make use of investment opportunities, increase his balance sheet and increase his sales.
However, a press speaker in the group refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to book a payment capacity rate of approximately 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained that his balance had been reduced since the end of August.
The last few weeks were hard for the group, who had to see their stock exchange rate decline by half, while the price for insurance against incapacity to pay increased rapidly.
This price went down on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of the large investment banks on Wall Street after the competition of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that 15 billion dollars, partly at Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett, had been cancelled.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republic around the 21st century is re-founding socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and the Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
That third was who, following the example of his peers and friends this Sunday, put the plan of a new constitution for election.
The mission is being carried out because according to the public results promised to 80% of the voters, 64% were in the vote with 'Yes'.
According to these results, 28% agreed with 'No', 7% of the voters were invalid and 0.7% were given out empty.
In order to adopt the draft Constitution, more than half of all the votes cast must be cast.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the end of the poll and a count of a non-governmental organization had announced a clear victory for `yes' and 63% to 70% prophesied.
On the night of Sunday on Monday, Rafael Correa had, by the way, requested the victory of his constitutional project.
The 'Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly', in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers south-west of Quito, and congratulated the Ecuadorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa of Chávez and Morales, as well as his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet, was congratulated.
The election held in silence in accordance with the observational order of the Organization of American States (OAS) referred to a text consisting of 444 points to ensure the 'new socialism' for which the President is employed.
The draft Constitution transfers state power to the economy by leaving it the only right to "development planning" in a country that is largely dependent on oil financing by foreign firms and the currencies that send immigrants to the country.
The project, which will be headed by the chosen Correa in 2006, also gives the head of state more extensive power, which will be able to carry out up to two consecutive mandates every four years and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will make use of this power and will pursue a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also ensures the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
Finally, it also foresees banning the presence of foreign troops, which will provide an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an equatorian base as the starting station for American anti-drug use.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
You're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held captive in the desert for 11 days, were brought back to the Egyptian capital this afternoon healthy and unharmed.
In the morning they were released from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached the military base al-Maza right next to Cairo International Airport at 3.30 p.m. on board a special aircraft.
They were brought directly without being able to speak to the press, on board a helicopter to the Maadi hospital, a foreign district of Cairo, to be investigated there.
They enjoy all the 'best health' and the kidnappers 'was not paid a ransom', Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the roll field.
After being taken into custody at a Safari on 19 September at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly brought back from 35 unknown detachments from a hiding place.
It is eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two leaders, four drivers, one border guard and the director of the agency of Egypt, organizer of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer stated that 30 members of the special units, from the board of two helicopters, launched the attack at night, shortly before the morning break.
`On both sides the shots fell and half the kidnappers were killed, the remaining fugitives,' said this responsible person, who wants to remain anonymous.
He stated that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special units had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian orders.
The head of the Italian diplomat Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade where he is, on the role played by the secret agents and elements of the Italian special units.
'We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionality and performance of our men from the secret service and the special units', he said without further details.
He also argues that a ransom has been paid.
On the night before night, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped a land vehicle in a patrol, in which the kidnappers, six of whom, including the leader from Chad, were killed and two arrests.
The army declared that they were in contact with a rebel group from Darfur, the Liberation of the Sudan-Unité (SLA-U), but that this movement was immediately opposed.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is a central issue of the current electoral campaign.
That's better.
But one area of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will stand up and start the miserable sums that will be granted to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or the national historical sites that are allegedly starving?
What politicians will dare to remind the Federal Government that it neglects their monuments and their culturally important buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, there are no proper laws that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government only makes EUR 3.5 million available for the restoration of the Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbours it is written in the Constitution of her country that the protection of the cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, parliamentarians and all government districts, in mutual agreement.
In Quebec, in the association of the historical societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 honorary officials gathered in 211 historical societies are trying to deal intensively with history, with a few groceries to save the numerous private archives, and to preserve the archaeological remains.
They are often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage, who protest with the strength of despair when supporters and decision makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten havens.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux government for the Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalisation, the Benelux States want to take advantage of the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank under their arms caused by the US financial crisis: the three States make available to the Banking and Insurance Institute, which also has branches in Hungary, a total of EUR 11.2 billion.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands consulted at the highest level on the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner of the Competition Authority of the European Commission.
In the euro area, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has continued for a year, so decisions that are now taken in connection with the bank could have a presidential character.
In the light of the decision taken on Sunday night, all three States buy the Bank's respective shares by about 49 percent.
The Bank will probably sell some of its shares, in particular all the insurance activities previously purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of the Fortis began a steep talfy last week, in the second half of the week already marked serious crisis scenarios.
However, analysts agree that the bank is too large with its 85,000 employees for a plea.
The Institute's securities fell on a 14-year-old floor by 12% on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two thirds.
In view of the current share price, the market value of the group is EUR 14 billion, which, according to the management, is unrealistic.
According to the management, USD 700 billion is a expensive US life package and the resulting uncertainty on the markets is due to the tal traffic of Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, the courses increased slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed the new Director General of the Bank.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but there was no interest in a business offer.
The Belgian government was trying to calm down - no investor is supposed to spend his money, it was called.
There has been no panic among the customers so far, the branches of the bank have not been shaken.
In Hungary, the Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls its own leasing companies.
Fuchs in the chicken barn
Because of a person's drug consumption, in America life and health insurances often refuse to conclude a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market may become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of drug data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we trust the chickens to the fox" - says Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurance determines the fees and payments in the event of damage depending on the health condition of the customer, and should the risk be considered too high, the insurance will not be completed.
The customer was previously sent to a medical examination, and the contract was only concluded in the light of the results of the investigation.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much more cost-effective method: based on the customer's identification number, he refers to the data of the last one and a half years of the pharmacies, talks about which medicines were bought, and the program calculates the patient's illness and how his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large quantities of cholesterol lowering drugs, it was found that his blood fat levels are untreated high, which would automatically select him as a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in progress - some define even a risk multiplier, so that the insurance needs to do more just the paper crest, however there are smaller difficulties.
One of the advantages is that many medicines can be taken for various purposes, such as against migraines and heat waves, but also against depression.
The latter is a high risk factor in the view of the insurers, while the latter are not mentioned.
For the purpose of querying and processing the data, companies have formed their own companies which, before referring to the data, ask patients for their consent.
In the meantime, they must do so by law, even though there have not yet been any concessions.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory tests and link them with the data on drug consumption. In this way they provide an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, and control of their use is becoming more difficult at the same time.
While there is a private data protection law for health data, its effect is limited to healthcare providers and insurance.
The draft law has already been submitted to the Congress, which allows authorities to control data processing companies.
Dick Richard sees that this is too little, so he wants to develop his program so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question, of course, is that the person concerned is unlikely to have access to his or her data because the insurance does not otherwise conclude a contract with him.
And that's how the chickens just kind of leave the grace of the fox.
Global food plan from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
After the European Union and India are the leading trading partners of each other, this was the main issue in addition to other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today, the French-India summit is also taking place, mainly discussing cooperation in the Atomic Energy sector.
While the European Union recognises that India is an ambitious, democratic force which should be given more votes and equal rights in international affairs, Member States have not yet been able to agree on whether or not to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not even discussed at the ninth summit in Marseille yesterday.
The French President and current EU President-in-Office of the Council of Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as President-in-Office of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana, received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached to double trade in the next five years, i.e. increase to EUR 100 billion.
In view of the fact that trade between 2000 and 2007 increased from 25 to 55 billion, this objective is not even so ambitious.
In this respect, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally incorporated into an agreement, so that air transport will also be taken off in the future.
By 2009, India would like to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to strike a balance between the EU and India in an unbalanced way: while the Union is India's number one partner, New Delhi is only in rank nine among EU partners.
The summit was devoted to global issues.
This included the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, which condemned both sides to the most severe. The call for a UN conference was also urged.
The Doha Round should also be completed, both sides being responsible for the failure.
The EU stressed that it is maintaining its energy and climate programme, which means that emissions of pollutants should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
In this way, India agreed, as well as with the proposal, to conclude a kind of global compromise at the forthcoming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 per cent by 2050.
The rise in food prices should also be combated, and both support the convening of an international conference on the subject of the financial crisis.
Today, the chief of government of India visits the French capital, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris it is hoped for orders to French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to the Agency's reports, the agreement is to be decided on at 15 years' time.
Over 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publisher at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
Over 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for the law enforcement.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair awaits the current event of over 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries. It will be distributed over the 171,790 square metres of the fair and over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the honor of the event.
The Undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented at the 264 sqm large exhibition room "Punto Italia".
This will be followed by a press conference near the room structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion figures, trends and perspectives will be discussed about publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign writers decreases in all, but especially in the adult and youth parts.
Found the billionaire Steve Fossett's missing little plane a year ago
Steve Fossett's small aircraft was discovered on September 3, 2007, on a flight over the desert of Nevada.
The individual parts were found on a 3,000-metre high plate, in the area of Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
However, there were no human remains inside the plane.
The sheriff of Madeira County, John Anderson, completely overcame the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located, and a troops has been dispatched. Now we have the assurance that it is the plane with which Steve Fossette flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found on or near the plane.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Bureau of Transport Safety (NTsb) noted that a team had been sent a few hours after the plane was sighted, which identified the machine: it was Bellanca 8kcab, who lost on 3 September 2007, after the launch of a 3-hour flight in Yerington in Nevada.
Yesterdays were also found in California, near the border to Nevada, some of the personal items of Fossette by a couple close to their house at the Mammoth Lakes.
This is two proofs with the name Fossetts, both published by the Federal Aviation Administration by illinois, cash and a Jacket.
The search for Fosset was abandoned one month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had conquered a place in history through a long sequence of records.
In 2002, he was able to complete the World Ball in a two-week, lonely flight as the first man.
Three years later he flew around the world in a single flight without intermediate landing by plane.
Among its several records is also a flight of 15445 m above the Andes, however, with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A suv that falls through its original design and the special line guide, the outgoing surface and its clear angle from the traditional schematics.
Mercedes-Benz has tried with this offroader to inhale the sector new breath.
Due to its exceptional characteristics, the idea of Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be seen in the showroom of Mercedes-Benz from October 17.
Thus, the advertisement that will accompany the appearance of the new model will also take place in new clothes, namely, in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a new industry in the car sector in Italy.
A project with a peak effort to be carried out in different phases, which will take the central shopping miles of Milans, Corso Como by 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in shape, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como to give the whole special optic: the new suv will appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car appears to be represented from the poster on which it is painted.
Using the Enlumina8 technology of the new glk, it is highlighted in various moments in all its details to re-compile itself as a whole.
Without a doubt, the concern of Mercedes with this advertising is to introduce a new type of self-advertising into this rather stereotype field.
But will it be possible to travel the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Now it is clear who the Italian Hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk stadium ban
Who are these 150-200 boys and girls for whom Italy is ashamed now? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group, which has been travelling behind the Italian national team for years and which, frankly, has not caused any serious problems until recently.
Never came to meet rival fans before.
The origin of the group lies in the right environment.
The sponsors come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
Other smaller groups from campaigns and apulia also met in Sofia.
They wear the tricolori on which the cities of the militants appear: however, they were far away on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their examples are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, there was now a conflict of views with a truly right-wing fance, that of Levski.
From the Figc, the Italian fans were given 144 cards for the game: all were displayed in names and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were also all controlled by the Viminal: among those traveling to Sofia, no one was with an ongoing stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who had already been pre-loaded in this regard, were also refused the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or exploding typhoids can be counted with a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to the stadiums throughout Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer put a foot in a stadium.
Good luck.
But now there is, of course, fear of copyists, who could follow this little more than 150.
"This fire must be issued immediately, and that does not in any case allow for justification," it says from the Viminal.
Therefore, "look at above all also with a view to playing the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
Because in Apulia there is actually a small core of the Italian Ultras.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio (Sports Osservatorio) gathers on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on a part of the aise, that is, the secret services that deal with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce Rufe and the raised right arm during the hymn of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a punishment..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed clearly in no joy), who has been the director of the Observatory on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the posts of Francis Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Formerly, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where a core of the supporters of Ultras Italia was founded in 2002.
It is true, Mazzilli says that it is not against the law in Bulgaria to praise the Duke, but undoubtedly the conduct of these 150-200 people was a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist – adding the No. 1 of the Observatory – crimes are committed in the country of their actions.
So far, this group has been on the move, but now we need to consider what has happened and what will happen.
But we also talk about the pipes during the Hymelis: even this is not punishment, but allow me, but there is no education ...".
