Members of the Galles Assembly are concerned about "making the figure of strawberries"
Some Members of the Assembly are consonant with the proposal to amend their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Parliament of Wales).
This proposal is a result of the programmes to change the name of the House in the Wales Parliament.
Members of the whole political arena are concerned that this may sound ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly has stated that his party is concerned that "can be rhyme with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who don't live in Wales: In Welsh, twp means cretino and pwp means casca.
A member of the Plaid Assembly said that the group in the whole "was not content" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Galese Conservative Party has claimed to be "open" towards the name change, but has stressed that only a small verbal step separates MWP from Muppet.
In this context, the letter W in Welsh is pronounced in a similar manner to the English statement of the Yorkshire letter U.
The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, which is currently in the process of introducing amendments to the names, said: "The final decision on any descriptors of what Members of the Assembly will be called will, of course, be a debate for Members themselves."
The Law of the Wales Government of 2017 granted the Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which supported the possibility of calling the Parliament of Wales.
As regards the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission has expressed its preference in favour of Welsh Parliament Members or WMP (Members of the Welsh Parliament), but MWP has received greater consent in a public consultation.
The AMs are apparently proposing alternative options, but the difficulties in reaching consensus could be a thank-you for President Elin Jones, who should present a legislative proposal on the amendments within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will include further changes to the functioning of the assembly, including regulations on the exclusion of AMs and the design of the committee system.
The AMs will receive the final vote on their name during the discussion of the legislation.
Macedonians join the referendum polls on the change of country name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change the name of their country to "North Macedonia."
The popular vote was organised in an attempt to put an end to a dispute for decades with the neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim on its territory and has repeatedly opposed its applications for EU and NATO membership.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite for the amendment of the name, said that he would not consider the result of the vote.
However, the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the name change is simply the price to be paid to be able to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells sit down while Harlem's churches are in trouble.
"The elders I spoke to say there was a bar and a church in the past," Adams said.
"There's not one of the two today."
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People are socializing differently today," he explained.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood halls people regularly attend."
As for the churches, we worry that the money from the sale of the assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will return to where they started."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartments with condominiums filled with people who will not help the remaining sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings are white," he said, "and that's why they're going to rush the time when these churches will be closed completely because it's unlikely that most of the people who move to these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by brothers before Harlem became a black neighborhood - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St Martin's a decade later.
The initial white Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation praying in a nearby church took possession of the building.
St. Martin's was acquired by a black congregation headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycotting against the vendors of 125th Street, one of the main streets for shopping in Harlem, who refused to take up or promote the people of color.
A fire in 1939 seriously damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's parishioners programmed his reconstruction, they also ordered the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor to St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the carillon in July called it differently: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also stressed that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a colour musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who passed to a larger carillon to the church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What has been staged in St. Martin's in recent months has been a complicated plot of architects and entrepreneurs, some presented by the lay leaders of the church, others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish assembly, the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July about its concerns about the fact that the diocese "tried to lower costs" on the parish assembly although the latter was not involved in the taking of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency by the diocese.
Squalo wounds a tredician in diving for peanuts in California
Official sources say that on Saturday a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy while immersing himself in search of peanuts in California, during the opening day of the Aragos season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that for half an hour he was immersing with friends Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming and swimming up to him and a group of people to take him out of the water.
Hammel thought at first that it was only enthusiasm due to the capture of a harpooneer but then "he realized that the boy was shouting 'I was bitten!
I've been bitten!'
His whole clavicle was lacquered," Hammel said he noticed when he reached the boy.
"I called everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' Hammel added.
The boy was transported with a helicopter to the Children's Hospital of San Diego, where he was found under critical conditions.
The species of the vessel responsible for the attack is not known.
Captain Larry Giles said during a communication to the media that a shark had been sighted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been declared not to belong to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper chest area.
Authorities have banned access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and security purposes.
Giles reported that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's programme a boost to the beauty products sector in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with courses dedicated to the beauty products of the large store assigned to specialized assistants
As part of the important drive to the beauty product market of 2.8 billion UK sterlings, which continues to grow as sales in fashion and household items decrease, the largest courses dedicated to beauty products will be tested in 11 shops in the country and adopted in several shops next year if successful.
The investment in beauty takes place at a time when supermarkets are hunting for new ways to use space on the shelves once dedicated to televisions, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's stated that it would double the size of its offer of items for beauty until it reached the 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees will occupy a larger space with burned areas similar to those in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique range of tricks so that most of the products are vegan - an ever-increasing quality demanded by the younger buyers.
In addition, the perfume dealer The Fragrance Shop will experience the authorizations in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
Online shopping and a move towards buying small quantities of food daily at small neighborhood stores have forced supermarkets to commit more to convince people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, the CEO of Sainsbury's, said that the sales point will increasingly resemble large stores while the supermarket chain tries to resist discount resistance such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos sales points in hundreds of shops and has also introduced different Habitats since buying the two chains about two years ago, and this strategy has boosted food sales and made the most profitable acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reduce its distribution of beauty and pharmaceutical products has been unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's had a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the synergy ended in a dispute over the division of revenues from pharmaceutical points of sale in supermarkets.
The new strategy was adopted after Sainsbury's three years ago sold its pharmaceutical business of 281 points sold to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds.
Lloyds was expected to play a part in the program, adding in four shops a wide range of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's said: "We have transformed the appearance of our beauty product departments to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands has been developed to meet every need and inviting environment and comfortable locations make us an interesting destination for beauty products, in contrast to the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "hot" after Holly Willoughby shows up at an 11 million-dollar deal
The Star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones is angry after the TV presentation Holly Willoughby withdrew from a contract of 11 million sterlings with his trend mark to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand of housewives and accessories right now.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This morning's presentation, 37 years old, used Instagram to announce his abandonment.
Holly Willoughby left the star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, angry after withdrawing from their profitable trend mark activity at the last minute to focus on his new outstanding contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources say that Jones was "urgent" when the golden girl on TV admitted to a meeting at the headquarters of his commercial empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new contracts - worth 1.5 million sterlings - did not leave him enough time to dedicate themselves to their brand of real housewives and accessories.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop's Goop's Goop's Goop's Goop and it was estimated that it would double Willoughby's heritage, estimated around 11 million sterlings.
Not until Willoughby, 37 years old, chose Instagram to announce his abandonment of True, Jones left Britain to go to one of his holiday residences.
According to one source: "Truly was undoubtedly Holly's highest priority.
It must have been his long-term future that he would have been committed to for the next twenty years.
His decision to abandon has left all those involved absolutely without words.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, they were so close to the launch.
There is a full store of products at Marlow's headquarters, ready to be sold."
Experts believe that abandoning the presenter of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost the company millions because of strong investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and due to possible delays in the launch of the brand.
And it could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin were friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby invented True with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52 years old, joined the company as president in March.
The couples spent their holidays together, and Jones holds a 40% share of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S brand and replace Ant McPartlin as guest of the ITV "I'm A Celebrity".
A source near Jones said last night that "he does not want to comment on his business."
Hard words and "then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would have received from the media to make a comment that some would have judged "non-presidential" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his voice in imitation of the "telepaper driver".
"I didn't give up anything."
He stressed that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first event in Singapore in June was proclaimed by Trump as a huge step forward towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations for denuclearisation are at a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho addressed world leaders during the UN General Assembly held Saturday, which North Korea did not notice a "equivalent" response from the US to the first North Korea disarmament operations.
Instead, he pointed out that the US is still imposing sanctions to keep pressure high.
Trump gave a much more optimistic view of this speech.
"With North Korea we are getting great results," he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results: the end of the missile tests, the contribution to the release of hostages and the return of the last American military.
And he defended his unusual strategy by describing his relationship with Kim.
"It's simple to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside who are trying to enter this crowded field, we'd have about 200 people right here in front," said Trump, pointing out the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia ravage an island, causing hundreds of victims
Following the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organisations were notified that they were not required.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok population had been displaced, the national emergency was not declared an essential requirement to activate international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, I have been very clear about not wanting international assistance, so it is a bit complicated," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not yet certain that the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Suddenly, spokesperson for the National Agency for Disasters, he said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to aid.
Considering the earthquakes to which Indonesia is continuously subjected, the country continues to be terribly unprepared in the face of the wrath of nature.
Although the tsunami shelters in Aceh have been built, this is not a common structure at other costs.
The obvious lack of an alarm siren for the tsunamis in Palu, although the alarm was given, has probably contributed to the loss of human lives.
Under the best conditions, moving between the many islands of Indonesia is complicated.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to assist the victims of the earthquake is heading towards Palu but it will take us at least three days to reach the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has put in the centre of his campaign the improvement of Indonesia's brand infrastructure and has poured money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has hit Joko's administration as it prepares for the reelection next year.
Joko must also face pressures from the persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted the most conservative branch of religion.
Over 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have been removed from their homes because of clashes on the streets between Christian and Muslim gangs, who fight using machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
Look: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool equals against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League against the Chelsea with a point at the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a passage from Xherdan Shaqiri while it was about 25 metres from the Chelsea gate, with its team below 1-0.
He touched the left ball before shooting on the second ball.
The attempt went high above the door frame as it turned towards the top right corner of the network.
The ball finally fell behind the back of Kepa Arizabalaga by falling into the net.
"Just try to get in position, get to the ball and players like Shaq always play ahead as much as possible, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante arrive and I gave a touch and I didn't think too much and I pulled it."
Chelsea won 1-0 in the first time after the goal at the 25th minute marked by the star of Belgium Eden Hazard.
The Blue Centravent has gone by the heel to Mateo Kovacic before skiing near the middle of the field and shooting in the middle of the Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick half-field transition.
So he took a beautiful walk that led to Hazard in the area.
Hazard crossed the defense and ended up on the second pole with a left-handed goal beyond Alison Becker's Liverpool.
Liverpool will face Naples in the round phase of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face the Videoton at UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia goes to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia reached 832, the agency responsible for managing the country's disasters said Sunday morning.
A number of people were reported interlocked between the masonry of the collapsed buildings following the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that hit the country on Friday and generated high waves up to 6 meters, reported the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, has been destroyed from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old suspected of murder after a woman was beaten to death
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 in the morning with gunshot wounds at Grayson Mews in John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested for suspected murder.
The police have invited people who may have seen or heard anything in the area to contact.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is just beginning, but I would like to call anyone near John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard something suspicious and invited them to contact us.
I would also like to make an appeal to anyone, especially the taxi drivers, who might have recorded something on the Dashcam, so that he can contact us because he could have very important information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was resident in Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, some friends who claim to know the woman arrived on the scene of the crime to ask questions about the place of return this morning.
The investigations are underway and the police have said that they are currently informing the victims' families.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment but was informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was left without a word when he found out what had happened.
The residents were informed that it would take hours before they were allowed to return.
A police officer told a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
Keep repeating "it's terrible."
At 2:00 p.m. two police vans were within the border area and another van was just outside.
Several agents were within the border area controlling the apartment building.
Anyone who has information about it is invited to contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at number 0800 555 111, indicating the registry 247 of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell of Parliament becomes the last monument hit by the wave of "writing history"
His removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects in England carried out by his followers puritans.
But Cromwell Society has defined Crick's proposal as a "crazy" and a "tempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the light of the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Palace of Westminster became an objective.
The iconoclasty during the British civil wars was neither ordered nor conducted by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft by Cromwell is proof of the opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many believe should still be celebrated.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was considered by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, a parliamentary defender from external pressures, in his case obviously of the monarchy.
That is an extremely accurate representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the 17th century has defined the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an identifiable figure that represents part of this fracture.
His results as Lord Protector must be celebrated and commemorated."
Killing pig killed a Chinese farmer by killing him
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a South-West China market on the news broadcast by local media.
The man, identified only with the surname "Yuan", was found dead with a resuscitated artery, covered with blood near a pig in the market of Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reported on Sunday the South China Morning Post.
A pig farmer prepares to inject pig vaccines into a farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai in China.
He reported that he had traveled with his cousin from the bordering province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pig with blood on the mouse.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the 250-kg pig had wiped out the breeder, standing on the statement.
"My cousin's legs were covered with blood and makeup," said the cousin identified with the name "Wu", as reported in Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance videos showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or the cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to avoid attacking other people, while the police collect evidence on the crime scene.
The Yuan family and the market authorities are trading a refund for the death of the farmer.
Although these are rare, cases of human attacks by pigs have already been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years ago, a 300-kg pig stuck a Galician farmer in his tractor until his wife managed to kick the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the blood taste can work as a "catalyst."
"They just want to play.
They're playful, very curious ..... they don't want to hurt you.
Just show them the right dose of respect," he explained.
The Strasciches of the Pink Hurricane Will Bring Heavy Rains in the South West of the USA
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as it moves on the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rains to northern Mexico and the southwestern coast of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa recorded winds up to 138 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane at 5 ET hours on Sunday and was 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, there is a drought on the Pacific Ocean and it is moving east towards the western coast of the USA. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, it will start to push a strong tropical humidity to the north, in the south-western part of the USA.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some areas of Mexico during Monday.
So the tropical humidity in contact with the nearby drought will create heavy and vast precipitation in the south-west zone in the coming days.
At local level, from 2 to 10 cm of rain may cause dangerous sudden floods, torrents of destruction and possible cliffs in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause precipitation rates that will reach 2,5-7.5 cm per hour in some points, especially in the areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation of 2,5-10 cm of rain is expected in some areas of the south-west, especially on much of Arizona.
There may be sudden floods with rapidly worsening conditions due to the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It is strongly recommended to venture into the desert on foot in the presence of the threat of tropical rain.
The strong rains could make the canyons of the rivers full and the tempo will wind up and lift dust.
The nearby drought will cause strong local rains on the coast of southern California.
Precipitation of more than 1 cm will be possible, which could cause limited flows of fatalities and sliding loads.
This would be the first precipitation of the region in the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona toward the end of Sunday and the beginning of Monday, before the rains become more extensive by the end of Monday and the beginning of Tuesday.
Heavy rains will come down on the Four Corners Tuesday to last until Wednesday.
In October there will be strong fluctuations of temperatures in the USA as the Arctic cools, but the tropicals will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to significant temperature changes on short distances.
An exceptional example of sensitive temperature differences in the Central USA will be recorded on Sunday.
There will be a difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the remaining heat of summer will try to increase and expand again.
It is expected to start in October for most of the Central and Eastern USA, with 26 oC from the Southern Plains to the north-east.
In New York you will be able to reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, i.e. a temperature of about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecasts indicate high probability of temperatures above average for the Eastern USA until the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people followed on Thursday on six television networks the winning deposition by the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual violence that would have occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continues, with the broadcasters interrupting regular programming for the last minute on Friday: an agreement made by the Senator of Arizona Jeff Flake to the FBI conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford informed the Senate Justice Commission that he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had struck her in a state of boredom and tried to rob her of her during a party to the superiors.
Kavanaugh, during an inflamed deposition, claimed to be 100% certain that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people indicated by Nielsen followed the deposition on Friday.
The company was calculating the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for the other networks that transmitted them, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty counting the viewers who follow the programs in the offices.
To put it all in perspective, this is a similar audience for a football game or Oscar Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinionists strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks, with an average of 5.69 million spectators during the entire day's hearing, Nielsen reported.
ABC was the second network with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS recorded 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure of the drama on Friday.
After the Office of the Moderate Republican issued a statement stating that it would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, Flake was arrested by CNN and CBS operators on Friday morning while he was being insulted by demonstrators while attempting to take an elevator to a hearing of the Commission of Justice.
It remained with low eyes for several minutes while it was reproved and transmitted live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told "He has power while many women are powerless."
Flake stated that his office had issued the statement and said, before the elevator closed, that he would have had other things to say during the committee hearing.
All cable networks and broadcasters sent live a few hours later, when the Commission of Justice voted to present Kavanaugh's appointment to the whole Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would have done so only with the certainty that the FBI would have analysed the charges against the candidate during the following week, as requested by the minority democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and other senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice was important, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have voted to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump launched an FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political making" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused people of criticising his programmes to let the European Union "political face" with the future of Britain and reiterates national interest in an interview with the daily Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, September 29, 2018.
In another side-to-side interview with the Prime Minister on the first page of the daily newspaper, his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson launched his attack on his so-called Chequers agreement for Brexit, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should receive their respective duties is "absolutely ridiculous"
Murder of Wayde Sims: Police arrest the suspect of the death of LSU player Dyteon Simpson
Police arrested a suspect of the death of Wayde Sims firearm, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested and imprisoned for second degree murder, said Baton Rouge's police department.
Authorities have posted a video of the match between Sims and Simpson, and the police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and claimed to have detected Simpson's DNA on them, signalled the WAFB TV station affiliated to the CBS.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said the suspect admitted that he accidentally shot Wayde.
The bail was set at $350,000, reported to the defence attorney.
The legal doctor's office of East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department recognized the merit of the task force for the state police fugitives of the State of Louisiana, the police science lab, the South University police and the area's citizens who provided assistance to the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director of the LSU thanked the forces of the zone order for their commitment and search for justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where the father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
Last season the player had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 2.6 rounds.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team was "dissolved" and "socked" for Wayde's death.
"This is what you worry about at all times," Wade said.
Vulcan ash savings City of Mexico
The ash that comes out of the Volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after the activity was increased in the crater and 183 gas and ashes emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was controlling the different Roms and the shots.
Pictures on the social media have shown subtle levels of ash that cover the paragliding of cars in the neighborhood of Mexico City as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have seen an increase in the activity corresponding to the volcano that is 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit the central area of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists on the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protestors of pro-independence met with the anti-sombed police teams and thousands of people joined opposition demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the controversial Catalan vote on the recession.
A group of masked separatists blocked by the anti-sommosis police targeted the police with eggs and threw dust paints, creating dark dust clouds in the streets that usually ravage tourists.
Further collisions occurred during the day with policemen who used manganese to contain the fight.
For several hours the groups of independents who sang "We will not forget, we will not forgive" were compared with the unionists who shouted "Long live in Spain."
The local press reported that fourteen people had to receive treatment for minor injuries received during the demonstrations.
The tension remained high in the independent region one year after the referendum of 1 October considered illegal by the Government of Madrid but recognized by the Catalan separatists.
The voters had voted with a overwhelming majority for independence, although the influence had been low, and the Catalans against the recession had largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people reported injuries last year after the police had tried to stop with violent clashes the referendum that was taking place at headquarters throughout the region.
The independent groups had gathered on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place but had to follow an alternative path.
Narcis Termes, 68, is an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife and claimed that he had no more hope of the possibility of the Catalonia becoming independent.
"Last year we lived one of our best moments.
I have seen my parents crying out joyfully for the opportunity to vote, but now everything is blocked," he explained.
Despite having won a fundamental victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan independent parties have made it difficult to maintain the momentum this year, with many of the most famous leaders of the movement who are in voluntary exile or in prison waiting for judgment for their role in organizing the referendum and in the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded with her phone the police support protest, said that the conflict was fueled by politicians from the two factions.
"The situation is increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison waiting for trial at the end of last year, announced that he will be running for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Presenting myself as a candidate for European elections is the best way to denounce the involvement of democratic values and the repression of the Spanish government," he explained.
Londonderry: men arrested after spying a house by car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after having repeatedly beaten a Londonderry house with a car.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, at about 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused to the gates and the building itself.
It is also possible that the car was hit by a whale at a certain point.
Menga's attack marks the victory of Livingston at 1-0 against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with the Livingston sealed the victory
The already promoted Livingston has left the Rangers shocked by relegating Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 matches as director of the Ibrox Club.
The goal of Dolly Menga made the difference while Gary Holt's team went to the second division with the Hibernaten.
Gerrard's team thus remains without a win out in the Premiership this season and will have to face next Sunday in the Hearts class, from which they separate 8 points.
On Thursday, the Rangers hosted the Rapid Vienna in Europe League.
In the meantime, Livingston continues its series of victories in the division, remaining struck by six matches, with Coach Holt who still has to see a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston wastes opportunity against unincisive guests
Holt's team should have been in advantage long before the goal, with their immediateness that caused the Rangers many problems.
Scott Robinson went down but dragged his action in front of the mirror of the door and Alan Lithgow could only walk out the door after he had entered to meet Craig Halkett's headshot from the other side of the door.
The guests agreed to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could make it difficult for the visitors to play with football.
And it was so that the crucial goal was achieved.
The Rangers gave a penalty football and the Livingston found an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson managed to pass to Menga, which he could mark from the center of the area.
Until then, the Rangers had dominated the ball holding, but the host team's defense had proved impenetrable, and Porter Liam Kelly had not had to worry too much,
This scheme has been maintained during the second time, although Alfredo Morelos has engaged Kelly in a standby.
Scott Pittman saw his goal shot stopped by the Rangers' Allan McGregor and Lithgow's Rangers' feet fired another Livingston game scheme.
The crossings took place in the Livingston area and were continuously neutralized, while two demands of rigor, after Halkett's contrast with Glenn Middleton's replacement and one by one, were rejected.
A "phenomenal" performance from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont by BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Until the last player, they have been exceptional, continuing to overcome expectations along this exceptional path.
Their game style and the collaborators have changed very little since their return to the maximum series, but it is necessary to give Holt a lot of credit for the way in which he has been able to push the team since his arrival.
He's had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, headed by a masterly organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worall in trouble throughout the game.
However, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite the excellent performances in some moments with Gerrard, in this case they have gone well below those standards.
The last passage is missing - only once they have managed to penetrate the opposing area - and you can consider an alarm bell for the Rangers, which are in half-class.
Erdogan received with contrasting reactions to Colonia
There were smiles and blue skys Saturday (September 29th) during the breakfast meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It was the last day of the controversial visit to Germany by President Erdogan, aimed at distancing relations between NATO allies.
They met on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's access to the EU.
Erdogan therefore went to Cologne for the inauguration of a huge new mosque.
The city hosts the largest group of Turkish people outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police have motivated the intervention to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from meeting in front of the mosque, but many supporters have come near to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators, including many Kurds, have made their voice heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to accept it in the country.
The protests reflect the dissipation caused by a visitor considered a hero by some Turks of Germany and called a depot by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in conflict with a car
A cyclist died in the fight with a car in London.
The incident took place near the intersection between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a traffic street in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived on the spot, but the man died on the hit.
The incident occurred months after another cyclist died, invested by a pirate on the street in Children Street, about a mile from where the incident happened on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police have stated that the authorities are working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
They were blocked from the streets and diverted buses and the drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six guards injured during a disorder
Six prison guards were injured during a disturbance at the male maximum security prison, he reported to the prison office.
The riot is exploded at the men's maximum security prison of Long Lartin in Worcestershire at 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still underway.
Specialized agents "Tornado" have been used to manage the riot, which involves eight prisoners and which is confined to a prison wing.
Agents were taken care of on the spot for minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison service said: "A specially trained prison staff has been deployed to contain an incident currently underway at Long Lartin's prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate the presence of violence in our prisons and all those responsible will be reported to the police and could be sentenced to a longer sentence in prison."
Long Lartin prison hosts more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital care following the attack of a prisoner.
And in October last year, anti-sombosa agents were called to intervene in prison to realize a violent tumult in which staff was attacked with billiard balls.
The Hurricane Rosa Threat Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (which could benefit areas affected by drought)
It is rare that tropical depression hit Arizona, but it is exactly what will likely happen at the beginning of next week when the last energies of the Rosa hurricane will pass through the southwest of the desert, creating sudden floods.
The national meteorological service has already issued emergency flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona to the south and east Nevada, South-West California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching Monday evening with rain.
Phoenix National Weather Service has reported on a tweet that only "ten tropical cycles have maintained the state of tropical storm or tropical depression within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border."
The most recent models of the National Centre for Hurricanes include precipitation between 5 and 10 cm, with peaks isolated up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern area, including central rocky mountains and the Great Basin, will receive from 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with peaks of up to 10 cm.
For foreign areas at the risk of sudden floods, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these precipitations are likely to be positive because the southwestern area is currently going through a drought period.
Standing at the drought monitoring centre, little more than 40% of Arizona is going through a period of extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
Initially the route of the Rosa Hurricane will be able to land firmly through the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, who was still holding the hurricane force Sunday morning with winds at a maximum speed of 85 miles an hour, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, in Mexico and is moving north to 12 miles an hour.
The storm will meet the coldest waters of the Pacific, thus losing power.
So it is expected that it will arrive in Mexico with a tropical storm force in the afternoon or in the evening of Monday.
Precipitation on parts of Mexico could be intense, creating a high flood risk.
"There are precipitations between 7.5 cm and 15 cm from Baja California to the north-western zone of Sonora, with a maximum of 25 cm," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning with a tropical state of depression, so to go through Arizona and to the southern Utah in the late evening of Tuesday.
"The main risk that can be caused by Rosa or her strands are intense precipitation in Baja California, in the north-western zone of Sonora and in the south-western desert area of the USA," the National Centre for Hurricanes reported.
These rains are expected to generate sudden, potentially fatal floods and flooding in the deserts, as well as landslides on the mountains.
Aggression of Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys at a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspected attempted murder after a sedentary was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at 4:00 BST on Saturday.
It was transferred to a hospital, where it remains in "stable" conditions.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, reported Avon and Somerset police.
The authorities have appealed to anyone who could have picked up on the phone what happened.
Trump claims that Kavanaugh "has suffered for the evil and anger" of the democratic party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the fierce and offensive tactics of the democratic party," Trump said during a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh "offered for the evil and anger" of the democratic party during the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh filed before the Congress on Thursday, denying in a passionate way the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford of sexual violence in his dealings decades ago, when they were still teenagers.
Ford also filed a hearing defending himself from the charge.
The President said Saturday that "the American people were able to observe the extraordinary quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most experienced minds of our time, a lawyer with uncountable precedents in the public service," he said in front of the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President made an indirect reference to the appointment of Kavanaugh speaking about the importance of republican influenza in the Middle East elections.
"Five weeks from one of the most important elections in our life.
I'm not a candidate, but I really have to," he said.
"For this struggle strictly for exceptional candidates."
Trump said that the democrats are committed to "resisting and hindering."
The first substantive procedural vote to the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh is scheduled to take place no later than Friday, according to the CNN a senior assistant to the GOP.
Hundreds of people killed by the earthquake in Indonesia and tsunamis, and the numbers of victims continue to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many were swept away by giant waves that fell on the beaches, when a earthquake of great magnitude and a tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to 6 meters (18 feet) had fallen on the beach at the crepusculo, rubbing away many people killing them and destroying everything on their way.
Tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the threat of tsunamis is kind of yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and they did not run away immediately, turning themselves into victims," Jakarta Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian agency for the control of BNPB disasters.
"The tsunami didn't just come, it dragged with it cars, trunks, houses, it hit anything on the terrain," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved into the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/h) before hitting the coast.
Some people are climbing on trees to escape the tsunami and survive, he explained.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the Agency for Disasters have shown numerous buildings and shops destroyed, torn and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The assistance escorts continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series was perceived in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released by the heavy Friday earthquake was almost 200 times the power of the atomic bomb launched on Hiroshima during the second world war.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have increased the size of the tsunamis, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extension" and claimed that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels are broken.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the masonry of collapsed buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were dispersed.
Nugroho said that victims and damage could be greater along the coast of 300 km (190 km) north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely paralyzed, with no information" by Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are over 300,000 people living in the area," said the Red Cross, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
"This and already a tragedy, but it could become even more serious," he said.
The agency was widely criticised Saturday for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the authorities said the waves had arrived at the time the alarm had been launched.
In an amateur video shared on social media, you feel a man on a top floor of a building that yells in an alarming way to warn people of the coming tsunami in the street below.
A few minutes after a water wall fell on the beach, rubbing off buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a huge blackout that interrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate relief interventions.
According to the authorities, the army has begun sending cargo aircraft with Jakarta and other cities, but the displaced still need food and other items of first need.
The airport of the city has been reopened only for rescue and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo scheduled a visit to the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The budget for tsunami victims in Indonesia amounts to more than 800.
It's terrible.
Although the World Vision staff of Donganga has managed to reach the city of Palu safely, where the employees have fled under roofs of canvas in the courtyard of their office, during the trip they have encountered scenes of devastation, Dosseba said.
"They told me they've seen a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
It's terrible.
Even while the relief groups have begun the difficult start-up operations of the relief facilities, there have been some complaints about the fact that foreign aid operators with extensive knowledge have been prevented from travelling to Palu.
The Indonesian legislation states that funding, provision and staff abroad may begin to arrive only if the site of a disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
And this hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, "O.K., this is a national disaster," we can accept international assistance, but the status has not yet been defined."
On the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the dispersed still maintained the hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that alleviate the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a child was extracted from a discharge.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been locked under the mattress for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the preparation of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained for the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia two of the dispersed paragliding paragliding pilots.
Other people involved in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
"As they vet in the paragliding sector, I am carrying my emotional load," he said.
Gendon told how, in hours after the news about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel within the paragliding community, he had desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to Palu's competitors, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, were stopped at a single grey mark rather than at two blue marks.
"I think it means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during a resupply of ATMs in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink operator who was re-supplying a ATM at Newport on the Levee, holding a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle was emptying a ATM in the entertainment center and preparing to deliver another money, researcher Dennis McCarthy said in the communication.
While busy, another man "sucked behind Brink's employee" and stole a purse with the money for delivery.
Some witnesses have identified various suspects fleeing the scene of the crime, standing in the news, but the police have not specified the number of people involved in the crime.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the offenders is invited to contact Newport police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes its name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
On Saturday's announcement of the name change on Twitter, he wrote: "The person formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41 years old, has been renamed Ye for a long time and has used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change took place before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he will present his new album, Yandhi.
It replaces Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for "emotive reasons", said the creator of the show.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West previously stated that the word contains a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most used word in the Bible, and it means 'you'" said West at the beginning of the year, talking about the title of his album with the radio player Big Boy.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
We have passed from Kanye, which means the only one, to simply Ye - the reflection of our goodness, our wickedness, our confusion, of everything.
The album is more than a reflection of who we are."
It's just one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, has also changed the name with or without indent and capital letters.
The elected president of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore not to use the army against the civilian population
Mexican elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use military force against the civilian population on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of a bloody revenge against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that "never use the army to suppress the Mexican people."
The soldiers had shot at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at a time when the left student movements were taking place throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by expanding monthly grants to students and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities push young people towards criminal gangs.
The USA should double the funding for the IA
While China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the funds dedicated to research in this field, says the investor and operator of IA Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow the announcements of various US government groups regarding IA, although in the US there is generally no formal IA strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its programme last year: it ambitions to be country number 1 in innovation IA by 2030.
"Redoubled the budget in the search for the IA would be a good start, considering that all the other countries are much more behind the United States and we need a new revolution in the IA," Lee said.
Double funding could double the chances that the next major success in the IA sector will be achieved in the USA, Lee told the CNBC during an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt publishing house, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of the major companies of IA in China, Face++.
In the '80s, Carnegie Mellon University worked on an IA system that beat Otello's American player with the highest score and was subsequently led by Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese section of Google.
Lee recalled the previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when to have next, to identify new visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain funds from the government, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking away academic leaders, they're multinationals," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies have taken up lighting from universities to work on IA projects.
Lee said that changes to immigration policy could help the US boost its efforts in the field of IA.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctors in IA," he explained.
The Chinese State Council published its programme for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation of Natural Sciences of China provides funding to those working in academic institutions, similar to how the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations distribute funds to US researchers, poor quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee explained.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defense has established a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, aimed at involving industrial partners and universities, and the White House has announced the formation of a special Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, it currently invests over $100 million a year in IA research.
In the meantime, the U.S. order to create a national Commission for Safety on artificial intelligence has not registered activities for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum for the change of the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on the possible change in the name of the country in "North Macedonia", a move that would resolve the long-standing dispute with Greece that blocked its requests for accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia, argues that the name of its neighbours constitutes a claim on its territory and has put the veto on Macedonia's entry to NATO and the EU.
The two governments have reached agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would damage the ethnic identity of the Macedonian population of the Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycotting campaign raised doubts about the possibility that the influenza would reach at least 50% needed for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the referendum card is as follows: "It is agreed with NATO and the EU's accession and with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
The name change supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say this is the price to be paid so that Macedonia can be admitted to institutions such as the EU and NATO, one of the emerging countries from the collapse of the former Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because this means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have stated that they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it final.
The change in the name would require a majority of two thirds in paralysis.
The State Electoral Commission has stated that there have been no irregularity reports until 13:00.
However, the flu was only 16% compared to 34% of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of the registered voters had voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, a capital voter, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia on the change of the name of the country that would open the door to NATO and the European Union accession to Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parmament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, was preparing a small stage and arranging the seats in front of the tents mounted by those who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to get in high, not the service door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have a dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can address others like China or Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that accession to NATO will bring much-needed investment in Macedonia, which accounts for a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said a "yes" would be "confirming our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Analysis reported that between 30 and 43% of the voters would have participated in the referendum - a percentage below the level of inflation required.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia indicated that 57% of the interviewees expected to vote on Sunday.
Of this 57%, 70% said they would vote for it.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the fluctuation must be 50% more than one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the West-West government since it was established in May last year.
Look: Sergio Aguero del Manchester City marks a goal by avoiding the entire Brigton defense
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took up the Brigton defense during the match won for 2-0 by Manchester City Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero seemed extremely easy at his mark at the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a half-field transition at the beginning of the action.
He moved between three defenders of Brighton before he fell into the open field.
Aguero was thus found to have four green shirts.
He humiliated a defender before overcoming them other than the Brighton area.
So he made a left pass, where he found Sterling.
The English attacker used the first touch in the area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton Mathew Ryan's doorman with a right-hand shot in the net.
"Aguero is having trouble standing" the city's coach, Pep Guardiola, told reporters.
"We talked about making him play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he was able to sign at that time."
But it was Sterling who initially took advantage of the Sky Blues in the fight for the Premier League.
The goal has arrived at 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep on Brighton's field.
He sent a beautiful filter ball along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few steps before driving Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues attacker pulled the ball off the net shortly before he left the field.
The City will fight Hoffenheim in the Champions League round at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium of Sinsheim in Germany.
Scherzer wants to play dirty against the Rockies
With the Nationals removed from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But as always competitive Scherzer hopes to be able to launch against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies, which maintain an advantage of a game on the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won at least a match with a victory of 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday evening, but they still hope to get their title in the first division.
"Even if we play aimlessly, at least we can be able to launch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team that will play will probably be at the highest level this year.
And why shouldn't I ever want to race?"
The Nationals still have to announce a first launcher on Sunday, but it is said that they are inclined to let Scherzer be launched in similar situations.
Scherzer, who would be the first launcher for the 34th time, held a launch session on Thursday and would be the first launcher in his normal rest Sunday.
Washington launcher is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 inning for this season.
Trump a meeting in West Virginia
The President made an indirect reference to the situation surrounding his candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of the influence of Republicans on the Middle East elections.
"All we've done is put at stake in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our life.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not a candidate, but I'm really giving up on this fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "Let's see this horrible group of radical democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using any means necessary, it is possible to see evil, wickedness.
They don't care who can hit, who must interfere to regain power and control, because that's what they want, power and control, and we won't give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have given themselves the task of "resisting and hindering."
"Ed has been possible to see it in the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "rageful, evil, evil and lying."
He referred to the Senate Justice Commission with Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by name, and he chained strong boards among the public.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you jam the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, um, no, I'm waiting for one - that was a bad language of the body - the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer very tolerant.
He won't tolerate people who say what they think
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, it was not a big surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour Members who have been informed not to welcome, and everyone because they said what they thought.
My fellow Member, Mr Ryan, has received similar treatment because he has firmly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me for expressing my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, ironically all issues similar to those on which Jeremy was at odds with previous leaders.
The notice for the meeting of Nottingham East Labour on Friday states that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a member of the parliament of the local Labour Party, Friday evening meetings were exactly that way.
Today, however, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more kind and kind" policy has been forgotten for a long time, if it has never been remembered.
It has become increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged on the basis of whether or not it is acceptable for party leadership.
All this started shortly after Jeremy became the leader of the party, and colleagues with whom I previously thought to share a similar political vision began to expect an investment on my part and that I would take positions that I had never accepted, whether it was national security or the single European market.
When I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - they follow up on insults on the social media asking for my withdrawal, reporting the politics of the centre and telling me that I should not be part of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I certainly know that I am more fortunate than other colleagues because my comments to me tend to be of a political nature.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to face a torrent of sexual or racist abuse every day but who are not intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of levels of insult.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer in a tolerant environment and with every move of distrust or amendment of the selection rules, the party is restricted.
In the last two years, I have been given a lot of advice, inviting me to lower my head, not so openly expressing my opinions and everything would be "good".
But it's not about doing this that I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, provoked by the inquiring of the Thatcher government that had left my secondary school class literally to fall apart, I have tried to defend better public services for those who need it most, as local councillors or government minister.
I have never hidden my political opinions, not even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be in any way distracted by my political positions and by the points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who have promoted the motion on Friday, I would like to say that when the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will harm family cores, companies and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy talking about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But actually the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, who are members of the Labour Party or less: I am proud to serve you and promise that no threat of exclusion or political opportunity will stop me from acting in defense of those I consider to be your best interests.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose: a Father struck the scale
Two late attempts might have somehow off-balanced the final result, but there is no doubt that Air has deserved the triumph in this exceptionally fun game of Tennent's Day Championship.
I'm now at the top of the class, the only team hit on ten.
In the end it was their superior defense, as well as their courage, that pushed the home team and coach Peter Murchied had all the reasons for being satisfied.
"We have been tested in our games so far and we are still beaten, so I must be happy," said the coach.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "We must recognize the merit of Ayr, they have made better use of our opportunities."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute goal, converted by Frazier Climo, but brought the Air to the advantage, but a yellow card for the Scottish player Rory Hughes, released by the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to speak the numbers and Jason Baggot caught an unconverted goal.
Climate has increased the air distance with a rigor before, just in half time, to signal and therefore to convert a goal alone to bring the air to 17-5 at the interval.
But Melrose well started the second time and Patrick Anderson's goal, converted by Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
There have therefore been a long interruption due to a serious injury by Ruarid Knott, which has been extended, and at the beginning, the Air is once again given advantage thanks to a goal of Stafford McDowall converted by Climo.
The Deputy Captain of Air Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and Melrose made the man pay in extra with a non-converted target of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a moment of strong pressure.
However, the home team came back and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow banner for a contrast with Climo without ball, from the touch of the rigor, MacPherson marked a touch down behind the air advancing mixture.
Climate has converted, as it had done almost since the start, after Rowe had collected the football from David Armstrong's area and sent flanker Gregor Henry to search for the fifth target of the home team.
Star of Still Game looking for a new career in the restaurant sector
Ford Kieran, a Still Game star, decided to move to the hotel sector after discovering he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor covers Jack Jarvis's role in the popular BBC show, which writes and interprets together with the long-standing partner Greg Hemfill.
The couple announced that the next ninth series will also be the final one of the show and it seems Kiernan is thinking about a life after Craiglang.
Standing on lists of official reports, he is Director of Arifingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to make statements, although a Scottish Sun source made it clear that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "successful restaurant trade."
"The sea is ours": Bolivia without a break on the sea hopes that a court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol a ship's general neighborhood covered with sariam in La Paz.
Public buildings expose a blue ocean flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are decorated with the motto: "The sea is our right.
It's a duty to get it back."
In all Bolivia without a drop on the sea, the memory of the lost coast and now in hand to Chile after a bloody conflict on the resources of the 19th century is still alive, as is the desire to swallow the Pacific Ocean once again.
These hopes may have reached the highest level in decades, while Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the leap, a spirit of unity and serenity and is obviously waiting for the result with a positive attitude," explained Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will respect the judgment of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, in the hope that the Aia Court will welcome Bolivia's claim that, after decades of intermittent dialogue, Chile is obliged to negotiate, guaranteeing Bolivia a breakthrough on the sea of State competence.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia - who is facing a controversial battle for the next year's elections - has a lot of dancing with Monday's judgment.
"We are very close to our return to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will find it difficult to decide in favour of Bolivia and that it would change little if it did.
The United Nations organisation based in the Netherlands has no power to allocate the Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice reached just six months after the final proceedings indicates that the case ‘was not complicated’, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from advancing the Bolivian cause, the past four years could have delayed it.
"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morale's belligerent rhetoric has failed any good intention of Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations to some extent, but it will be very difficult to hold discussions as a result of what has happened.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia to the Aia, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making process would be particularly accelerated.
On Monday, Bolivia will be able "to enjoy extraordinary opportunities in relations with Chile" and will have the opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual advantage", he explained.
He also denied his Morales - one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - he is using the maritime issue as a political escalation.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," she added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen without confidence in the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has stated that his nation will never carry out nuclear weapons disarmament if he cannot trust Washington before.
Ri spoke Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to have faith in the promises made during the Singapore summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments arrive when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be planning to relaunch diplomatic talks in standby after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri explains that it is an illusion that the continuation of the sanctions and the opposition of the United States to a declaration of the end of the Korean War can never put North Korea on the knees.
Washington forbids issuing the statement without first taking important disarmament actions.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread scepticism about Pyongyang's intention to give up an arsenal that the country probably considers the only way to ensure its own safety.
Pompey is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Parisian fashion shows present the latest trend in huge covers that will soon be in a high fashion shop near you
If you want to expand your collection of blankets or completely block the rays of the sun, do not try again.
Valentine's and Thom Browne's stylists have revealed a series of crazy oversize covers for their spring-summer 2019 collection that impressed the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have made fun of Instagram this summer and these stylists have sent their exciting creations on the passageway.
The main piece of Valentino was an exaggerated beige hat decorated with a large lead-like edge that submerged the heads of the models.
Other oversize accessories included unjeweled anguria, a witch hat and even an pineapple - but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of weird masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colored masks have sewn lips and look more like a representation of Hannibal Lecter than at high heights.
One creation looked like a complete dive with masks and glasses, while another looked like a dissolved ice cream cone.
And if you continue with the huge style statements, you're lucky.
Style watchers predict that huge berrets could reach you in the streets of high fashion.
Outsize hats arrive on the foot of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a large thesis more than a meter that has been seen on anyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very little practical hat that invaded the social media has sent another huge creation in the passageway: a beach bag in large straw almost as much as the model in the costume that carries it.
The roasted orange raffia bag, refined with raffia fringe and with a white leather handle was the strong piece of the Spring-Summer 2019 collection by Jacquemus' La Riviera at Paris Fashion Week.
Stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I predict that these big hats and beach bags will arrive in luxury shops next summer, because the stylist has had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversize accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scottish independent schools maintain a curriculum of academic excellence and this is continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results at the exams, strengthened by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other collective efforts.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide their students and their parents with the best level of service.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further higher education, chosen careers and their place in the world as global citizens.
As an area of education that is able to develop and adopt a personalized school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular subject and demand within schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message will reach his brain.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, the message will come to his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English only if we want to create trust relations with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's exams, we can see that languages are above the graduates, with the highest rates of success within independent schools.
68% of students who have studied foreign languages have obtained the highest votes.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS schools, showed that 72% of the students received the highest vote with praise in Chinese, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish obtained the highest vote.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as basic skills for children and young people, who will undoubtedly need them in the future.
Currently, languages, as a matter choice, are considered at the same level of STEM materials (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in the study plans of independent institutions and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the United Kingdom Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that the reasons for the difficulty of covering jobs are attributable in 17% of cases to a lack of language skills.
For this reason, language skills are becoming increasingly essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
With ever-increasing work opportunities that require language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of your chosen career, if you have learned a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future with life skills like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically lead a multilingual person to competition.
With a survey of YouTube among over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% was unable to speak a foreign language at a sufficient level to maintain a conversation, and the French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
For this reason, it is so important for children today to invest in language teaching.
The knowledge of more languages, particularly those of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a valid job.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages taught.
Several schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom by looking at 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with the teaching staff specialized in this area.
The Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and provide them with the necessary skills for success, whatever their future.
It is not possible to deny at this point, in a global trading system, that languages continue to be fundamental to the future of the country, and this must be reflected in teaching.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut with the Lakers Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans waiting for LeBron James to make his first entry with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the pre-compiled opening game on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it still has to be set for how many minutes it will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Laker reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for a limited number of minutes.
After the first week training, James was asked what his plans were for the programme of six pre-component Lakers games.
"At this point in my career I don't need friendly games to prepare me," he said.
The moment of meeting a West Virginia of Trump, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump from early tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, at a rally.
This is the first meeting of the five scheduled for Trump next week, including stops in friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of confirmation suspended for his choice to cover the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump will try to create support for the next midterm elections as the Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress in the November elections.
When will Trump start and how can you follow him online?
The start of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can follow the start of Trump in West Virginia online via live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about the hearings this week of the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who became the thesis due to allegations of sexual violence with an early confirmation vote by the Senate suspended for a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
But the main purpose of this series of beginnings is to help the Republicans who have to face the November elections to get a little push.
Thus, President Trump's campaign has stated that these five meetings over the next week are aimed at "energizing volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority holding the Senate and the House of Deputies," which is located in Reuters.
"Congression control is so crucial for its programme that the president will travel as many states as possible while we end up in the most busy season of the campaign," said a spokesman for Trump's campaign in Reuters, asking to remain anonymous.
Programed for the Wesbanco Arena of Wheeling, the beginning of tonight could appeal to supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the coverage of the Pittsburgh media," standing at West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the state in which he won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate to the Republican Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is in line in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to try to push him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, standing in Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team shows the courage to fight to keep hope alive until Sunday's individuals
After three unique sessions, Saturday afternoons could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The bike of the oscillating pendulum is a completely invented sport concept in which players firmly believe and never like in competitions like these.
So where would the bike be now?
"They had a six-point advantage and now they're four, so I'd say we're keeping a little bike," Jordan Spieth said while he was away at the end of the day.
Europe is, of course, in favour of four further points with 12 others at stake.
Americans feel they have a little wind in favor, as Spieth said, and they have a lot to hope for, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and each one boasts three points in four.
Spieth was spitted from tea to green and he's giving the example.
The festive gouts became stronger as the game continued, sinking a crucial putt to match the accounts to the game four, when he and Thomas were under two points after two.
His whore who made them win the 15-hole match was welcomed with a similar scream, which tells you that he thinks the American team isn't out of the race yet.
"You really have to make it all up to you for your game," Spieth said.
It's all that each of these players can do now.
18 holes to make a point.
The only players with several points of Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unmistakable version of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable couple in Europe are four to four and cannot do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only couple not to pull a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogey Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the ninth door Friday morning.
That path, and the way their energy seems to flow from and towards the hot crowd consolidates the certainty that they are the players to beat Sunday, and there would not be a more popular player of Fleetwood or Molinari to suggest a possible European victory while the sun hovers over Le Golf National.
Preferably both on different mouths at the same time.
However, the speeches of European glory are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made it soon to reach Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four-ball in the morning, when he was together with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogets on the first nine holes have melted the Spanish and Swedish in a hole from which they have not even managed to climb far.
But on Sunday, there's no one to help you get out of your mouth.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to observe from a distance through interactions between couples, advice that they give and do not give and how the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has gained an important advantage in the final day but this foursome session has shown that the US team has the courage to fight, which some, in particular Stateside, have doubted.
Europe with an advantage of 10-6 in the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a solid advantage in the final day of the Ryder Cup after completing the fourball matches and Saturday's foursomes with an advantage of 10-6 on the United States.
The inspired couple made up of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the load with two victories on a Tiger Woods in difficulty to take the score to Le Golf National at four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, in an attempt to preserve the lost trophy in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an irregular American team in the morning's fourball, winning 3-1.
The U.S. has more resistance in the fursomes, winning two matches, but they have not been able to recover the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from the 12 teams on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first great European to win four consecutive points while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second couple to win four points from the four openings in Ryder Cup's history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into the fourballs, they worked in a great way to beat down Woods and the amazing American Bryson Dechambeau with an even cleaner 5-4.
Woods, who was drawn for two Saturday matches, showed occasional bluffs of genius but lost 19 of his 29 matches in the fourballs and the foursomes and seven rows.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning's fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson's side in the foursomes to beat 2+1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - number one and three of the world's rankings.
However, Europe has not achieved all the results expected in a pleasant and ventilated day south-west of Paris.
The three great winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the reference for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a grinsy 2&1 victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourballs and then returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes, losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history a team came back from a four-point gap passing to the individual, although as the owner, Fury's team needs only one match to defend the trophy.
After being the best second for two days, however, a Sunday contract seems to be out of their reach.
North Korea absolutely rejects unilateral disarmament without confidence
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea declared to the United Nations Saturday that the maintenance of sanctions was undermining the country's trust in the United States, that in such circumstances it would have absolutely refused to renounce its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho stated on the occasion of the General Assembly of the World Organization that North Korea has adopted "significant measures of good will" during the past year, such as the stop to nuclear and missile tests, the decommissioning of the nuclear testing site and the commitment to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We do not see any response from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no security in our national security and in these circumstances we absolutely refuse to disarm ourselves unilaterally for the first time."
Although Ri has re-used the lamentable notes concerning Washington's resistance to "in phase" denuclearization with which North Korea would be rewarded on the basis of step-by-step actions, his statement was important because he has not completely rejected unilateral denuclearization as already done by Pyongyang.
Ri made reference to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump during the first absolute meeting between a US president in charge and a North Korean leader, held in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim undertook to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees to North Korean security.
North Korea has sought a formal final agreement to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has stated that Pyongyang must first renounce its nuclear weapons.
Washington is also opposed to appeals to alleviate the severe international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The US insists on the need to "have a denuclearization first" and to increase the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive manner and even oppose the "end of war declaration," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can put us on our knees is an illusion of those who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is increasing our distrust."
Ri did not refer to programmes of a second meeting between Kim and Trump that the US leader had announced to the UN at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last 5 months and added: "If the counterpart of this issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the USA, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be at this point dead."
But also, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from that of last year's UN General Assembly, when he said it was inevitable to point out the US territory as an objective with North Korea missiles after "the evil president" Trump had called Kim a "missile man" engaged in a suicide mission.
Before the United Nations Trump, which had threatened to "completely destroy North Korea" last year, he praised Kim for her courage in undertaking the disarmament path, but declared that there must be much more to be done and that sanctions will remain in force until North Korea is denuclearized.
Wednesday Trump said he didn't have a deadline, saying "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated Thursday to the UN Security Council that: "The respect of the Security Council's sanctions must continue with strength and with no exceptions until complete, final and proven denuclearisation is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously supported North Korea's control sanctions in 2006 in an attempt to undermine the funding of nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompey met with Ri at the edge of the UN General Assembly and then declared that he would visit Pyongyang again the following month to prepare a second summit.
Pompey has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
It was distributed by Pyongyang in July claiming that progress had been made, but a few hours after North Korea had accused him of having submitted "demands from gangsters."
North Korea had committed itself during a meeting this month with Moon to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States had adopted "conformity measures."
He stated that Kim had explained to him that the "conforming measures" he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had committed to Singapore and actions towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students follow a course on how to get sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has moved all its students to sleep more in an attempt to contrast the growing male culture to study for full nights fed by caffeine.
A university student found that university students number one in the world often have no idea of the basic concepts of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed the course, which he considers to be the first of this kind in the United States.
He had the idea of starting the course after a conference that had given rise to the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
"At last a girl came from me and said to me, 'Why is this just told me now, when I'm last year?'
She said no one had ever told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me very much," she told The Telegraph.
The course, given for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits can help academic and athletic performance and improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director general of health services at the university, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffered from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The course of one hour provides for a series of interactive activities.
In a section there is the image of a bedroom, where students can select cup of coffee, tents, gym shoes and books to get to know the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performances are influenced by sleeplessness, and the importance of a evening routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the effects on the health of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride related to "night in white to study" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students lead to the lack of sleep to be a growing problem.
Sleeping enough and with a good quality sleep should be the "secret weapon" of the students to fight stress, poverty, anxiety, explained and should even help avoid fatting, as sleeplessness carries the brain in an inedia mode, making people constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian student enrolled in the Faculty of Chemical and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler to develop the course, after following one of his lessons last year during his first year at Harvard.
He explained that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course aimed at the entire campus.
The next step, hopefully, will be to ask all graduates to follow a similar study programme before enrolling in this competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advised students to set a wake for when they should go to bed, as well as for when they should wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic displays and LED lights, which can send in tilt the circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal is to defeat Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another attack of depression out of the house with the goal of Dolly Menga who relaunched Steven Gerrard's disarmed team to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
Ibrox's team was looking for the first victory out of the 4-1 triumph of February in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team hit the second defeat of Gerrard in 18 coach matches leaving his team at eight points by the leaders running from the Ladbrokes Premiership, Hearts.
Menga marked seven minutes before the interval and a short-inspired Ranger formation never seems to be able to compare.
As the Ranger descends to sixth place, the Livingston jumps to third, and only behind the hibernian because of the goal difference.
And there might be more problems coming up for the Rangers after the Calum Spence Guardian was cured for a head wound because of an object apparently launched from the outside of the house.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which quickly exceeded Air in the half-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose the usual training that broke a point at Hearts last week and would have been satisfied with the way his well-prepared team suffocated its opponents every time.
The Rangers may have dominated by the possession of a ball, but Livingston has made better use of the balls at its disposal.
They could have signaled just after two minutes when Menga's filtering passage in the first time sent Scott Pittman to the door of Allan McGregor, but the middle camper missed the opportunity.
A deep-rooted punishment football by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only pull on the side of the second floor.
The Rangers took control but it seemed to be more hopeful than convincing in their game in a rigid area.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought that he should see to it that he was going to have to give up a rigor at the end of the 15th following a meeting with Steven Lawless, but Arbitrator Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian demands.
The Rangers managed to pull only twice in the first time, but Ibrox Liam Kelly's former porter didn't get worried about Lassana Coulibaly's head beating and a soft shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the Livingston opening goal at the 34th minute may have been unexpected, no one can deny that he has deserved it even because of his commitment.
Again the Rangers failed to manage a football placed deep in Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher filtered the ball into Scott Robinson, who kept quiet about choosing Menga for a clean conclusion.
Gerrard acted during the interval replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and the change had an almost immediate impact as the wing infiltrated a ball in Morelos, but the exceptional Kelly threw herself off the door line to block it.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors exactly into the kind of game they love, with Lithgow and Halkett collecting one long ball after another.
Holt's team might have increased the gap in the final stages, but McGregor objected to stop Jacobs before Lithgow pulled out of the corner.
The replacement of Rangers Glenn Middleton submitted a final request of rigor after a crossing with Jacobs but Thomson refused it again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our lunch "Sunday Morning": 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today and the CONTEGGIO continues... the day on which the future physical Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that made the device known as Geiger counter.
A solid point of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a pillar of pop culture, when in the 1950's film "Bells of Coronado," interpreted by those unbelievably credible scientists cowboy Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to identify radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones you can really feel the effects of atoms released by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "She's just cracking right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, only a few days since his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new vaccine against cancer can teach the immune system to "see" the malignant cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise malignant cells as part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, and their laboratory alteration
They can therefore "see" a common protein to many types of tumors and are thus re-injected
An experimental test of this vaccine is giving promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine who teaches the immune system to recognise malignant cells has seen her ovary cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells by a patient and their laboratory alteration so that they can "see" a common protein to many types of cancer, called HER2, and therefore these cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of the United States based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
The HER2 protein "promots the growth of various types of tumors", including that in the breast, the ovaries, the lungs and the colon-right, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar procedure for the extraction of immune cells from patients to "teach" them how to hit the tumor cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.

It didn't go well.
Kanye West was enrolled in the study during a Saturday Night Live score after a final performance during which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would be candidate in 2020.
After interpreting his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a mahout, he started a fuss against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Many times I speak in white and they say to me, "How do you like Trump, he's a racist!"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he explained.
The SNL started the show with a scene whose protagonist was Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star took Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Commission against the allegations of sexual violence presented by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it has not been transmitted, the record of the Philippe in West has been loaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock himself is trying to get around West with the publication.
In addition, West complained to the public about having spent a bad time in the backstage because of its cover.
"I got bullied in the backstage.
They said to me, "Don't go out with that joke."
I've been bullied!
And so they told me I'm a marginalist," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see the submerged place?" and he said, "I'd wear Superman's coat because that means you can't tell me what I have to do.
Try love."
His comments generated boards at least twice by the public and the members of the SNL cast seemed embarrassed, Variety said, with a person who told the newspaper: "On the study there was a death silence."
West was invited to replace the last minute of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West has performed many with a performance of the song I Love It, wrapped in Perrier's bottle.
West received support from the group of the conservatives TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: GRAY FOR HANDING TEST TO MASSA."
But the show director Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "what it is and this is just wonderful."
"But I have chosen NOT to reward anyone (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his "art") who I think is embracing a voodoo ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
And so it's us," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now "the person previously known as Kanye West."
This is not the first artist to have changed his name and is following Diddy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper's friend, Snoop Dogg made himself known as Snoop Lion and, of course, the lost musical legend Prince, who had changed his name into a symbol and thus in the artist previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder for killing in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The defendant will have to report to Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Office of the Public Prosecutor.
The Star of Sword Throne Kit Harington attacks toxic maleity
Kit Harington is known for his role as fighter Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Sword Throne.
But Actor 31n attacked the stereotype of the male hero, claiming that these on-screen soils often make boys believe that they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview at The Sunday Times Culture, Kit claimed that "something went wrong" and reflected on how to manage the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married the co-star of the Spade Throne, 31 years old, has allowed himself to worry a lot about this problem.
'I am personally concerned, very at the moment - what was our mistake with masculinity?' he said.
'What have we taught men as they grow up in terms of the problem we are witnessing now?'
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for the increase in male toxicity due to its extremely male characters.
He continued: 'What is infuriated and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and on the streets, which makes boys think they have to be in this particular way of being human?
I think this is one of the great dilemmas of our time - how can we change things?
'Cause of course something went wrong for young people.'
In the course of the interview, he also admitted that he would not interpret any pre- or follow-up of the Sword Throne once the series was completed next summer, stating that he had "completed with battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will play the main role in the Revival of True West of Sam Shepard, the history of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a rapist.
The actor has recently revealed that he considers the meeting with his wife Rose the best thing that happened with the Sword Throne.
"I met my wife during this series, so she gave me in this sense my future family, and my life from now on," she explained.
Rose interpreted Ygritte, the object of Jon Snow's love, the character of Kit, in the fantasy series winning the Emmys.
The couple married in June 2018 in the holding of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% of new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people with HIV and AIDS.
Over 820,000 people are affected by these diseases, according to health authorities.
About 40,000 new cases have been reported already in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of the new cases are due to sexual transmission, which marks a change from the past.
In some regions of China, HIV has spread in the past as a result of blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has declined to almost zero, according to the Chinese health authorities during a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people affected by HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 units.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an urgent problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was criminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Because of the country's traditional values, some studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are caused by inadequate protection during sexual relations within such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its commitment to managing the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of the staff has stumbled the data of the GOP senators, and speaks of "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
On Saturday, the U.S. MP filed charges against a member of his staff concerning the publication of personal information by three U.S. republican senators in the Wikipedia legislative pages.
The Democratic Member of Los Angeles has stated that the statements have been promoted by opinionists and websites of the ' ultra-right wing'.
"Bug, lying and still spreading lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published would include home addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was published online on Thursday, issued by an anonymous Campidoglio during a hearing of a commission of experts on charges of sexual violence against the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The news leak happened after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservatory sites such as Gateway Puntit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the post source was associated with the Waters office and issued information regarding a member of the Waters staff.
"This falsified accusation is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been rescinded as a result of these false and trendy accusations, has not been in any way responsible for the escape of such information.
This falsified accusation is completely false and an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly generated online criticism from the former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"This lie is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This implies that he does not have the character to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't be angry.
It must not be provocative.
He must not question the accused's reasons.
It must remain calm and serene."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by the detractors of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate on the run to overthrow Waters in the midterm elections, expressed his views on Twitter.
"Great if confirmed," he tweeted.
In his statement, the Waters stated that his office had alerted "the competent authorities and the forces of the order of these trendy statements.
"We will ensure that those responsible are exposed," he continued, "and that they must respond to all their dangerous and harmful actions for all members of my staff."
Review by Johnny English still hits - the parody of the spy with a Rowan Atkinson undersized
He is now used to looking for references to Brexit in every new movie with a British touch and this seems to apply to this revival of Johnny English's comedy action, which began in 2003 and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English - The Renaissance.
Will the veiled self-governing on how bad we are doing be the new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English from the face of rubber and the eyes out of the orbits has obtained his license to cast things for the second time - and his name indicates more than anything that is a comical creation developed for countries of non-anglophone filmmakers.
Of course it's the stupid secret agent that despite his strange claims of glamour has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pizza of that kind that contributed with a single note to the theme of Gloria's moments of the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
This is a character originally based on the traveler and mysterious international man that Atkinson once interpreted in the now forgotten TV ads of Barclaycard, who left the chaos behind.
There are one or two nice moments in this last release of Johnny English.
I liked Johnny English that he was approaching the helicopter by wearing a medieval armor and the elites were pulling briefly against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is obvious, but humor seems quite undersized and strangely superfluous, especially now that brands of "series" such as 007 and Impossible Mission now offer comics as an ingredient.
Humour seems to be directed to children rather than adults and for me the crazy accidents of Johnny English are not as original and targeted as the gags of Atkinson's mute movies when he interprets Mr. Bean.
Immutable news now is the fact that Britain is in serious danger.
A computer hacker has been infiltrated into the British spy supersecret web network, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, with the neglect of the agent in charge, a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the drop that makes the vessel go wrong for an alleged and troubled prime minister, who is already suffering from a lack of political impotentness: Emma Thompson does his best with this character like Teresa May but there is not much to work on in the copy.
Her intelligence consultants inform her that every single active spy has been compromised and that she will have to recall someone who has already retired.
And this means that the poor Johnny English, who now works as a school leader in a chic establishment, but who also teaches in an official way about how to be an undercover agent: here you can appreciate some nice gags, when English offers a school of rock espionage course.
English is released to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meets with his former sufferer Bough, again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, married to a submarine commander, a girl role of the high society where Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a waste.
So the Batman and Robin of Disasters for the Secret Services of His Majesty are again in action, to meet the beautiful fatal woman of Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletin.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling dangerously into the network of the billionaire charismatic technology that claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: left Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their hate of ridiculous adventures: traversed by chameriers, they set fire in a French restaurant; they set fire to hell by secretly introducing themselves to the luxury yacht of Volta and English creates pure anarchy while trying to use a mask of virtual reality to take a mesmerise with the inside of Volta house.
All the scenes are certainly designed for the last sequence, but as exciting and exuberant, there is a lot of TV for children throughout the story.
Everything is modest enough.
And as with Johnny English's other films, I couldn't help but think: couldn't the British film industry assign Rowan Atkinson to a role that makes his talent right?
The Labour Party refuses to be drawing up a plan so that the British can work four days a week but be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical program that would allow British citizens to work four days a week, even though they are paid for five.
The party would like the main companies to transfer the savings obtained by the revolution of artificial intelligence (IA) to workers by offering them an extra rest day.
In this way employees could enjoy a three-day weekend, keeping the same pay.
Some sources have stated that the idea would be compatible with the party's economic programme and with plans to propel the country in favour of the workers.
The transition to a four-day day was brought down by the union congress as a way for workers to benefit from the evolving economy.
A senior Labour Party member said to The Sunday Times: "A review of the political line is planned by the end of the year."
"There will not be a day to come, but a four-day working week is an in-line aspiration with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy for workers, as well as with its industrial strategy as a whole."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support a similar idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day working week in the context of the 2017 general electoral campaign.
In any case, this aspiration does not enjoy the unanimous support of the Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not part of the party's political line and is currently not the subject of discussion."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of the Labour Conference last week to detail his vision of a socialist economic revolution.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "faceless leaders" and "speculators" in public services companies.
The plans of the shadow Chancellor also imply that the current shareholders of the water distribution companies might not recover their entire stock package, since the Labour Government could implement the "deductions" on the basis of the behaviours considered unlawful.
It has also confirmed plans to include employees in corporate boards and to create funds for inclusive participation, so as to transfer 10 per cent of the net assets of private sector enterprises to employees, which end up in the annual dividend pocket up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could make them change their mind
The FBI investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has referred the final vote for his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raises the question whether the findings of the government agency can influence or affect any of the republican senators in providing their support.
In an interview that's going on Sunday's wave, Scott Pelley's "60 Minutes" correspondent asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it's possible that the FBI bring to the light something that could make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than her colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said it as I came to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after what happened, who came out of that charge, and I said, "Did you do it?"
It has been resolved, determined, unmistakable."
Graham's vote, however, seems carved in the rock.
"I have clear ideas about Brett Kavanaugh and they could resist a bombing charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett vigorously denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And whoever you named couldn't prove it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything new in change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that sees the display of a large star cart and has an equally remarkable mission: to end poverty in the world.
At the seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people turning to the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy performance like that of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real purpose of the event, that of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
To receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the public of the concert had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, send email to a world leader, make a phone call or any other significant way that would contribute to raising awareness of their goal of eliminating poverty.
But exactly how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been now that it remains 12 years to achieve its intended purpose?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is really a genuine way to persuade people to call for action, or is it just another example of so-called "clickivism"- people who feel really making the difference simply by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has claimed to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, committed for a lot of different purposes.
It states that these actions have contributed to encouraging global leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than $37 billion, aimed at influencing the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In the early years of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements made by their actions, of which at least $10 billion was already disbursed or used as funds.
The group estimates that so far protected capital funds have had a direct impact on some 649 million people in the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and performers based in the United Kingdom, committed to "help children grow to the maximum of their potential", with the promise to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help eliminate malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens just like you, we can ensure that social injustice or malnutrition become a footnote in history," the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition Tracey Ulllman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group has also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions have been implemented calling for the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government has announced the expansion of funds for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the FAQs on his website, which asked: "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and hard path - sometimes we will frame and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of those who will perform this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to implement "a block" and hinder Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
Washington can, if necessary, use its Navy to prevent Russian energy sources from being available on the market, including that of the Middle East, has revealed the Secretary of the Interior of the United States of America Ryan Zinke, as mentioned by Washington Examiner.
Zinke has confirmed that Russian involvement in Syria - in particular, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they live in the Middle East is because they want to negotiate for energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern side of Europe," he said.
And according to officials, there are ways and means to confront you.
"The United States has the opportunity, thanks to the Navy, to ensure that nautical routes remain open and, if necessary, to implement a naval block, so that their energy is not placed on the market," he said.
Zinke turned to the agreement on the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that self-defines the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's strategies to negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are, in fact, the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to make a financial lever and replace fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "a little versatile", with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
Statements have been made because the Trump administration has been involved in a mission to strengthen the export of its natural liquid gases to Europe, and to replace Russia, an option that is the most economical for European consumers at all.
To this end, officials of the Trump administration, including the same President of the United States Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the North Stream 2, a project of "inappropriate" pipeline which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the North Stream 2, a $11 billion gas pipeline, designed to double the existing capacity of up to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economical project.
The Cremlin object that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply guided by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, following a September meeting in Moscow with Rick Perry, Secretary of Energy of the United States.
The position of the United States has triggered the negative reaction of Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's industry-wide organization, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to remain out of the European Union's energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I see as a big problem that a third state interferes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider seriously" to run for the presidency in 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts
Senator of the Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would take "serious consideration" to run for president following the mid-term elections.
During a city assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he could consider candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and set up our poor government, and this implies having a woman at the top," he said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take seriously the appointment of President."
During the Warren City Assembly, he said about President Donald Trump, saying he was "bringing this country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Warren was explicit in criticizing Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, appointed by him to the Supreme Court.
On Friday, Warren wrote in a tweet: "It is natural that there is a need for an FBI inquiry before the vote."
A survey published on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren's electors do not believe that they should run in 2020.
58 per cent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not compete, according to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32 per cent supported such a candidacy.
The survey has achieved greater support for a candidacy by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent in support of a potential candidacy and 48 per cent in return.
Other names of high profile democrats discussed on a potential candidate in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, as reported by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Palin at Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after falling into September
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night
"What's happening to my son, what's happening after he's back, I can put it in relation to other families that experience the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorders and some of the injuries that our soldiers bring back," he told the public at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said, of his son and other war veterans, "they return a little different, hardened, wondering if there is respect for which their soldiers and pilots, and every other member of the army, have dedicated themselves to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of assault and domestic violence on a woman, which interfered with a report for domestic violence and possession of weapons of fire under drugs, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States and the District of Colombia support the challenge for new asylum policies
Eighteen States and the District of Colombia support a legal battle against a new U.S. policy that denies asylum for victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 States and the District of Colombia presented a memorial friend curiae in Washington on Friday to support an asylum-seeker who challenged this policy, as reported by NBC News.
The full name of the defendant in the Grace v. Sessions appeal that the American Union for Civil Liberties presented in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She stated that her partner "and her violent gang members" abused her, but the U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20th.
She was put in a standby position in Texas.
The prosecutors who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum candidates in the United States, as nations that face increasing problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reopened a decision taken in 2014 by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed an application for asylum to immigrants without documents fleeing domestic violence.
On Friday, the Attorney General of the District of Colombia, Karl Racine, stated that the new policy "misses decades of state, federal and international law".
"The federal law requires that all requests for asylum be judged on the basis of the various and particular circumstances of the request, and a similar prohibition violates that principle," says Ambitus curiae.
Within the memory, prosecutors also objected that the policy banning the entry of immigrants damages the US economy, affirming the clear likelihood that these will become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary manpower".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judges to no longer provide asylum for victims fleeing from domestic abuse and gang violence.
"The asylum is accessible to those who leave the country of origin because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality, membership of certain social groups or for political opinion," Sessions said on June 11th, as part of the announcement of the political line.
Asylum has never been designed to alleviate every problem -- even all the serious problems -- that people have to face every day throughout the world.
Desperate attempts to recover in Palu while the death budget doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming more and more desperate.
"There's a lot of tension," said the mother of 35enne Risa Kusuma, as she comforted her little boy in a evacuation centre in the devastated city of Palu.
"At any moment there's an ambulance carrying bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
The residents were seen returning to their destroyed dwellings, rubbing between their frigid personal effects, in an attempt to recover anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were shocked.
Some of the injuries, including Dwi Haris, a victim of a back and back fracture, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where the patients were treated outside due to the continuous strong outpourings of assistance.
His eyes filled with tears as he recounted the feeling given by the violent earthquake that shook the room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor of a hotel.
"There was no time to save us.
"I've been crushed between the walls, I think," Haris reported to the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife yell for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "making prepotences" with "advertising"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page advertisement on a U.S. newspaper, publishing the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to advertise.
Last Wednesday, President Donald Trump referred to the announcement paid by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the newspaper with the highest sales in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US congress elections of 6 November, an accusation China rejects.
The prosecution moved by Trump, regarding the fact that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections, noted what US officials reported to Reuters as a new phase of a Washington-based escalation campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a escalation trade war that has seen them adapt their duties to their imports.
China's return duties at the beginning of the trade war had been designed to strike exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, as Chinese and US experts have said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and previously long-standing governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods in China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register Sunday, "now increases those prepositions by publishing advertising on our free newspapers."
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the beloved American tradition of freedom of speech and press, placing a fee advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, in the building on the road here in Beijing you will find few dissident voices and you will not see any real reflection of the disparate opinions that the Chinese people might have on the problematic economic path of China, as the media are under the firm grip of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
She added that "one of China's most daily signs has issued the offer to publish" her article, although she has not stated that the newspaper is about.
The Republicans are alienating the female electorate before the mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh case, analysts warn
Since many Republicans at the end defend Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court and are on their side in dealing with various charges of sexual harassment, analysts have indicated that there will be a negative reaction, especially by women, during the future half-mandated elections.
The agitation in this regard has been extremely high, and many Republicans have already officially shown their desire to proceed with a vote.
"You can't withdraw these things," he told The Hill Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last minute's insistence on an FBI investigation would be enough to put the angry voters in place.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow or November," she said on Friday, according to Washington, D.C., Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior consultant and national spokesman for the progressive MoveOn group.
On Friday morning, protesters repeated the slogan "November is coming!" during their protest in the Senate Chamber, when the Republicans who control the Judicial Commission chose to continue with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as reported by Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats are going to the stars," said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst.
"People say they were already high; it's true.
But they could be higher, especially among the indecisive periphery and young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who often do not vote, even though they do not appreciate the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which provided details of his allegations of sexual harassment against the candidate to the Supreme Court, analysts had assumed that a negative reaction could have been observed if the Republicans had continued with the confirmation.
"For the GOP it has become a confusing set," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Republican Committee, according to NBC News, at the beginning of last week.
"It is not only about the vote for the committee, the final one or if Kavanaugh is to be put in a tank, it is also about how the Republicans have managed the situation and how they have dealt with it," he said to the news channel Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect Democrats.
In any case, Americans seem to be somehow divided between the person to whom to believe following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a lower percentage in favour of the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of the interviewees certainly or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent declare that they certainly or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that Kavanaugh probably lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently conducting investigations into the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one of the other prosecutors, Deborah Ramirez, as reported by The Guardian.
Last week Ford testified under oath, before the Senate Judicial Committee, that Kavanaugh had assaulted him in Hebrew when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez argues that the candidate to the Supreme Court exposes his genitals during a party during the studies in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a New Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, an inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that tries to rival with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend of technology, Inrupt, is a company that brings its origins from the open source Solid platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what people can access and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked about the intention behind Inrupt being "dominating the world".
"We have to do it now," said the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "online personal data store" or an POD.
It can include lists of contacts, things to do, calendars, musical libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available on a single browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of the online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user who can have access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal enhancement through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to John Bruce, CEO of the company, is to provide adequate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers in the staff involved in the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology programmers from around the world will be able to revive their decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team won't say "Facebook and Google if you introduce or not a complete change where their business models are completely wasted from one day to another.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to seek commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built from Solid".
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Commemorated the Ecclesiastical of the Great War with Victoria Cross
The only Church of England ecclesiastical to be awarded a Victory Cross during the First World War by combatants was commemorated in its hometown after 100 years.
The Lieutenant Colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann, received recognition on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellengise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a Chechen and never knew that he had achieved the highest level of British military honor.
On Saturday at a stand in Rushden, in Northamptonshire, his two grandsons opened a memorial latte.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said he was "magnificently symbolic" that the stone would have been opened exactly 100 years from his grandfather's award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion beyond the Canal of Saint-Quentin "through a super-fitty fog, under the heavy fire of the camp and war machines".
Then he hurried towards the line of fire and with the "largest gallantry" he made the line advance before having run with a single-handed cannon and landed three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German uncle on October 4, 1918 - just one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never be up to and something that makes him more humble".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown of flowers after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he felt really honored to have a role in the parade" and added "the value of a true hero is shown by the support he will receive from many people".
MMA fans stayed on their feet all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they caught Peppa Pig
Imagine, you've been up all night looking at the famous Bellator 206 just to see you denied the vision of the main event.
The San Jose program included 13 fights, including six on the main card, and had to be broadcast in the UK during the night, directly on Channel 5.
At 6:00 p.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet, the television viewers in the United Kingdom were stuck when Peppa Pig appeared on the screen.
Some remained based after being awake until the early hours of the morning specifically for combat.
On Twitter a fan described the transition to cartoon animated for children as "a kind of bad taste joke".
"The government regulation provides that at six o'clock in the morning that content was no longer appropriate, so we had to switch to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of Bellator for marketing and communication, when asked for transmission.
"Peppa the pig," "yes."
"The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they would work on programming to include viewers from the UK in the future.
"I believe that when I think about the replay, I think we can probably find a solution," said Coker.
"But there are six in the morning of Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution before Sunday of our time zone, Monday for them.
But we're working.
Believe me, when the program changed, a lot of messages came and nobody was friendly.
We were trying to solve the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you, next time it won't happen.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six - as we do in the normal way - and we have tried to get both for the fans, and we have just discussed it.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "less" because of sexuality
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to anyone because of his sexuality - but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he came to high school, that "not all are like me."
Speaking at the first point of Desert Island Discs of Radio 4, presented by Lauren Laverne, she said that she had made her voice hear about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also stated that being a parent made him less important to win the Olympics.
The practice of presenting the old-fashioned program, Kirsty Young, has taken a number of free months for disease.
Presenting himself as a marginalist in Laverne's first program, Daley declared that he had felt "less" anyone else as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable that he liked both the boys and the girls".
He said, "Today, the feeling of feeling less than, and feeling different, was the things that really gave me the strength and energy to succeed."
He wanted to prove to be "something," he said, so that no one would be disappointed if by chance they had discovered their sexuality.
The two times bronze medal at the Olympics became a high profile LGBT activist and used his face in the Australian Commonwealth Games this year to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he had made his voice heard because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three times the world's champion said that being in love with a man - the US director Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 - "was a surprise."
Daley married Oscar's winner, who was 20 years older than him last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When I was so young" - he went to his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar high and low.
Both became parents in June, of a child named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" was changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about the fact that 'I had to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 years after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father didn't accept the fact that he was dying and that one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you won't be from these places so you can be in the first row, Dad'," he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and until he actually stopped and died, I had not yet realized that it was invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics, winning the bronze.
"I only knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life - swimming in front of a house audience in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song - Heather Small's Proud - which had a special meaning for him in the preparation for the Olympics and still brings him the ocean skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The Mickelson shape put in a bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will mark a record Sunday when he will play his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to get back in shape to avoid becoming a miserable stone.
Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for a 12th time in record, was put in a bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and the foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has often been for the United States, the five times the champion spent the day between making a cheerleader and working on his own game in the range, in the hope of correcting what torments him.
Never having been the strongest driver even at the end of his career, the 48 year is not the ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National, where the lost route regularly penalises the wrong hits.
And if the course by itself wasn't quite encouraging, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, faces the accurate British Open Francesco Molinari champion, who collaborated with the novel Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points below the beginning of their 12 individual games, start with a boiling start, Mickelson's game could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his own man, not that he could say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a pack on his back, put a hug around me and said he'd be ready for tomorrow," Fury told me.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It's a Hall of Famer and has added so much to the teams in the past, and this week.
I probably wouldn't have imagined him playing two games.
I had imagined more, but this is the way it went and this is the way we thought it should go.
He wants to participate, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record on Sunday for most of the games played in the Ryder Cup.
It could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that has never reflected the heights of its personal record.
Mickelson has 18 winnings, 20 defeats and seven equals, even though Furyk said his presence has brought tangible goods to the team.
"It's funny, sarcastic, argumentative, likes to play people, and it's a fantastic boy to have in the meeting room," he explained.
"I also believe that the younger players had fun to sit down against him this week, something that was fun to watch.
He's done a lot more than playing"
The Captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a good advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the individual meetings of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a distraction.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 meeting in Valderrama, where the team, led by Seve Ballesteros, despite a five-point break from the Americans, reached the target line with a minimal advantage, winning 141⁄2-131.2.
"I continue to repeat that we had a good advantage in Valderrama, we had it in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but little," said Bjorn (in the photo) after seeing the 2018 class win, Friday for 5-3 and yesterday for 10-6, at Le Golf National.
"So it'll be history to prove to me and my team that it's not over.
Tomorrow we need to give the maximum.
You have to go out there and do everything the right way.
It's not over until the points are marked in the sink.
Our goal is to try to win the trophy, and that is what we need to focus on.
I always focus on the 12 players of my team, but I know who's on the other side: the best golfers in the world."
Happy the way his men raced in that difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never have overcome it.
Tomorrow's a different challenge.
Tomorrow is the turn of individual performances, which is something else.
It's nice to meet a teammate there when things are going well, but when you're just your golfer skills are hard to prove.
This is the message you need to deliver to players: tomorrow, you have to get the best out of yourself.
Then you forget about your partner because he also has to go there and pull out the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, counterpart Jim Furyk will be looking for the best individual performance in his players, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who have collected three points on four.
The same Furyk was found by both parties at those big meetings of the last day, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn before losing against the European "Miracle of Medina".
"I remember every single word," he commented in answer to the question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, led his players in the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but we want to leave right away with the right foot we did in Brooklyn and in Medina.
When the game starts to take a certain fold, the pressure increases in the intermediate games.
So we organize our consequent training and classify the boys in the way we think it is appropriate, because tomorrow we will try to do magic.
Thomas was given the task of driving the opponent and facing Rory McIlroy in the top match with, in order, the other Europeans, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, in the first half.
"I chose this order because I think it covers the path to the end," Bjorn said about his selection for individual meetings.
The new military ship of Germany has been postponed again
According to local media, Germany's latest military fleet would have to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old military ships of the cold war times, but there will not be at least until next year due to faulty systems and a cost burden.
The Rhineland-Pfalz commission, the admiral ship of the new baden-Württemberg class, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which cites a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the military Navy in 2014, but worrying issues after delivery have tormented the destination of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class ships.
They will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-air and anti-native missiles as well as some hidden technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, in fact it should be possible to use the new brakes up to two years away from national ports.
However, the continuing delays imply that innovative warships, which are said to allow Germany to project its excessive power, will become obsolete when they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The F-125 Frog accident reported last year, when the German military Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time the military Navy returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
It was little known about the reasons for the refund, but the German media have noted a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that have made the ship useless if used in a combat mission.
The deficiencies in the software were particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg class ships will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors, just half of the staff of the older Bremen class ships.
Furthermore, it has emerged that the ship is definitely too heavy, and this reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future updates.
It is believed that the Rhineland-Pfalz, of 7,000 tonnes, is twice as heavy as similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project (including equipment training) is becoming an important issue.
It seems that it has reached EUR 3.1 billion (US$ 3.6 billion) from the initial EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems involved in the new frigates become of particular importance in the light of recent alerts concerning the reduction of German naval power.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, parliamentary commissioner for the Armed Forces, admitted that the military Navy actually "has no means of being used".
The official has stated that the issue has deteriorated considerably over time, since the old unarmed ships have not been replaced by new ships.
His regret is that none of the baden-Württemberg class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust spyes on the secret life of the bats
New research carried out in a holding of the Scottish Highlands is aimed at revealing how the guns use the view to seek food.
It is hoped that discoveries can shed light on the behaviour of the only existing flying mammals and guide future protection activities.
The study of the scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and surprising pips, as well as brown ears and daubenton pips at the Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special registrants will be located in key locations around the property to track the activities of the pistols during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using portable detectors.
The analysis of the sounds recorded by an expert will determine the frequency of beeping and the manner in which each species is treated.
A map of habitat and a report will then be produced to create a detailed picture on the scale of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS nature conservation consultant, hopes that the results can reveal what habitat areas are most important for the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows, and how best to maintain the forests for pips and other related species.
The population in Scotland and the United Kingdom declined significantly in the last century.
Pistols are at risk because of construction and development works that are interested in trespoli and ruin the habitat.
The wind turbines and lighting can also constitute a threat, as can the wet paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The guns aren't really blind.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to identify insects and obstacles on their path.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes the guns very seriously.
Ten qualified experts conduct regular investigations, inspect the warehouses and sometimes perform rescues.
The organisation even set up the first reserve of Scotland to be used only for pipelines in the Threave region of Dumfries and Galloway, which hosts eight of the ten species of pipelines in Scotland.
The holder's manager, David Thompson, claims that the property is the ideal territory.
"We've got a wide area for pistols in Thrave," he said.
"We have ancient buildings, many secular trees and a good habitat.
But there's a lot about bubbles that we don't know yet, so the work we're doing here and in other properties will help us understand more about their need for growth."
It underlines the importance of controlling the whistles before driving maintenance within the properties as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single mother rabbit may kill up to 400 females and small ones, perhaps by spraying away a whole local population.
Pistols are protected and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, disturb them or destroy their trims.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish responsible for the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn about our pistols and for many of our species we don't know how to pass it on to their populations."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape while lawyers cause the German weekly
Christian Ronaldo has labeled charges of rape against him as "false news", claiming that people "want to advertise" with his name.
His lawyers are preparing to cause the German weekly Der Spiegel who published the charges.
The Portuguese attacker of Juventus was accused of having raped an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel also noted on Friday the charge of payment of $375.000 to keep silence on the incident.
In a video on Instagram directed to its 142 million followers, in hours following the accusations, Ronaldo, 33 years old, broke statements like "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false," says the five-time Ballone d'Oro directed to the camera.
"They want to advertise themselves through my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous for making my name, but this is part of the game.
I'm happy and everything's fine," he added the shoemaker smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to bring charges against Der Spiegel, defined as "an unacceptable reporting of suspects in the private sphere".
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the footballer would ask for compensation for "moral damage to the extent corresponding to the seriousness of the violation of privacy, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights in recent years".
The event would have taken place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a discotheque, Ronaldo and Mayorga would be back in the shoemaker's room, where he submitted him to anal violence, as reported in the statements filed with the District Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga argues that Ronaldo would have kneeled after the accident saying he was for "99 percent" a "brave boy" disappointed by "one percent".
It appears from the documents that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had had sexual intercourse, but that this was consensual.
Mayorga also declares that she had gone to the police and hospital, where her injuries were photographed, but that she subsequently agreed to a conciliation agreement as she felt "terrorized by the returns" and worried about the prospect of "being humiliated publicly".
The 34-year-old is now trying to renegotiate the agreement, claiming to be still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to pass to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the crash, and this summer he will join the Italian Juventus with a contract of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK will regret the loss of car manufacturers forever
The United Kingdom "needs to repay forever" the loss of its world leader status in the construction of cars after Brexit, said Industry Minister Greg Clark.
He also added that he was "anxious" about the statements made by Toyota UK to the BBC regarding the possible exit of Britain from the EU without an agreement and the consequent momentary block of production in the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Minister Clark.
The Japanese Automotive House argues that delays at the borders, in the case of a Brexit without agreement, could affect jobs.
Burnaston's factory, in which Toyota Auris and Avensis are built, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production in our factory will stop," said Marvin Cooke, Director General of Toyota in Burnaston.
It raises concerns among other English car manufacturers for the EU's exit without an agreement on the operation of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, argues that after Brexit will shut down its Mini plants in Oxford for a month.
The main concern concerns the risks in the supply chain encountered by the manufacturers in the case of Brexit without agreement.
The Toyota production line is managed on the basis of the concept "just in time", with parts arriving every 37 minutes by English and European suppliers for cars in order.
If, on 29 March, the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement, there could be difficulties at the borders that would cause delays and a lack of parties.
It would be impossible for Toyota to have more than one day of inventory value in its Derbyshire establishment, the company said, so production would be stopped.
Minister Clark argues that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely thought to avoid these problems at the borders".
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that will allow us not only to enjoy the current success but to take this opportunity," he told Today's BBC Radio 4.
"The test, not only from Toyota but also from the other car manufacturers, is that we absolutely have to be able to continue what was a chain of great success distribution".
Toyota has not been able to say how long production could stop, but in the long term it warns that additional costs could reduce the competitiveness of plants and potentially jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is responsible for the union delegates of the plant, says that the workers are strongly concerned: "On the basis of my experience, once the jobs are reduced, they are not reintegrated."
A spokesman for the government said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could still be postponed, says the White House.
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Justice Vice-Minister Rod Rosenstein could be "remunerated for a week", while continuing the debate on Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller who investigates Russian interference with the elections, the links between Trump's advisers and Russia, and the possible obstacle to justice by the President.
The possibility that Trump could fire the Deputy Minister of Justice, thus endangering Mueller's independence, has fed Washington's gossip for months.
During the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a chemist to record the talks with Trump and try to remove the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House and shouted he himself to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Wednesday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said that "I would rather not" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid overlap with the hearing of the Senate Justice Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual violence, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's training of the FBI's questions against Kavanaugh, further delaying the final vote of the Senate.
On Sunday, Trump's spokesman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "A date has not been established, it could be this week, I imagine it will be another week considering everything that is going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I'll keep updating the press."
Some journalists might contest this statement: Sanders does not have a briefing with the press at the White House since September 10.
Driver Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of briefing is not due to an advert for television journalists "that are showing up", although he said, "I do not disagree with the fact that they are showing up".
So he made me think that the direct contact between Trump and the press might be more frequent.
"The president has several sessions of Questions and answers from any president before him," he said, adding without quoting the evidence: "We have checked the figures."
The briefings will still be there, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this, as in the last few weeks, and this will replace the briefings with the press and you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
The press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown the reason by giving a free-wheel talk, and at the same time a curious one, in front of a group of journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to the European workers of the Scottish NHS to express his concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working at Scotland's NHS to express their gratitude and hope that they will stay after Brexit.
Mr Freeman, Member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter with less than six months in advance of the UK's entry from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to meeting the costs of registered status (satisfied status) requests for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Minister Freeman writes: "All summer there have been ongoing negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on Brexit, which will lead to autumn decisions.
But the British Government has also prepared itself in the event of an unagreed scenario.
I know this is a period of great concern for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate my appreciation today for the contribution made by all staff members, regardless of nationality.
Members from all over the EU, and not only, provide valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, benefiting patients and communities to which we offer a service.
Scotland is certainly your home and we strongly want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie was surgically operated after a head injury
The defender of Tennessee State Tigers, Christian Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency surgical operation after reporting a head injury in the Saturday match against the Vanderbilt Commodores in which the team lost for 31-27, as Mike Organ of The Tennesseen newspaper reported.
Technical Manager Rod Reed told reporters that the incident that caused the injury occurred shortly before the interval.
"He got close to the shipyard and he fainted," Reed said.
The first rescue staff and medical staff have given Abercrombie the oxygen on board camp before putting it in a barrel and taking it away for further tests.
A director of Tennessee State reported to Chris Harris of the Nashville WSMV, Tennessee, that Abercrombie underwent surgery at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "not yet reported on the type and amount of damage" and that the Tennessee States are trying to understand when it was injured.
Abercrombie, a student in the second year, is on his first season with the Tennessee States after he moved from Illinois.
He had made a total of five rounds before leaving the game, which brought his total season to 18 rounds.
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher bull tax for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher bull taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Labour Plans
The maneuver will neutralize the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters
The increase in bull tax will be applied to taxpayers who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Treasure plans to collect up to 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be subject to higher stock taxes for the purchase of property in the United Kingdom and the additional cash flow will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The maneuver will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters with the promise of providing more affordable and higher income accommodation.
The increase in bull tax will be applied to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional resources will be supported by the Government's initiative to combat the phenomenon of homeless people.
The surplus, which is added to the current ball tax, including the high levels introduced two years ago on the second houses and on the real estate buy to lets (bought for rent), could be more than 3%.
The Ministry of Treasure provides that the maneuver can collect up to 120 million pounds a year.
An estimated 13% of the new buildings in London are purchased by non-resident citizens in the United Kingdom, increasing prices and making it difficult for buyers to enter a first house in the real estate market.
Many of the country's richest areas, especially in the capital, have become "phantom cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the state.
The new policy arrived a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a cut on the ball tax to help the younger people with the purchase of the first house.
He accused the major construction companies of keeping the prices of the properties high by acquiring the land without using them and encouraged Prime Minister May to give up the quotas on affordable accommodation to settle the British "immigrant dissatisfaction".
Mr Corbyn has announced an excellent series of proposals for reform of the housing market, including checks on rents and the elimination of undeclared landmines.
He also wants to give the council more powers on the construction of new properties.
Prime Minister May said: "Last year I said I would be committed to restoring the British dream, which is that life should be better for the new generations.
And that means restoring the real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it would not be right if the purchase of a house was equally easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and for foreign companies, as it is for British resident workers.
For many people the dream of owning a house has become too remote and the dignity of the homeless remains a reality."
Jack Ross: "My greatest aspiration is to guide Scotland"
The technical director of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "maximum aspiration" is to become a manager of Scotland before or after.
The Scottish, 42 years old, is attracted by the challenge of solving the North-East team currently in third place in League One, at three points from the top.
It is reached the Stadium of Light this summer after being guided by St. Mirren during the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I was in series B and that's all," Ross said to the BBC Scottish Sportsound program.
I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my father as a child and it's something I'll always remember.
However, this will only be possible if I succeed as a team manager."
The predecessors of Ross at the lead of the Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former technician of the Alloa Athletic argues that there is no desire to follow such important names, in an equally important team, having previously rejected the proposals of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me at this moment is measured by the ability to bring the team back to Premier League."
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, we can say that it certainly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task, but I think I'll only be able to make the team go up."
Ross's career began three years ago, after a period as a coach in Dumbarton and 15 months as a replacement coach of the Hearts.
He then helped Alloa save himself from falling back to the third level and took St. Mirren from the back of the Championship's championship championships, the following season.
Ross claims to feel much more comfortable now than during his football career in the Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical teams.
"It was probably a real turning point," he recalls regarding the direction of the Alloa.
"I really thought the manager's role was made right for me, more than the player's.
It seems strange because I worked well, earned a living, and had some good results.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with weekly.
I still deal with them in terms of stress and pressure, but management seems good.
I've always wanted to lead and now I'm doing it, I feel much more calm than I've ever been in my life."

According to one study, the right time for a painting is 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave has brought more incassions to the English public in difficulty and more concern to the restoration services.
Data show that pubs and bars have seen an increase in sales of 2.7 per cent in July, while the inboxes of restaurants have dropped by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, of CGA's commercial consulting company, put together the data and commented: "The persistence of the sun and the long stay of England to the World has made it possible that the month of July followed a path similar to that of the month of June, when the pubs were over 2.8 percent, while the restaurants were hit more severely.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the June restaurant is worse in July.
The pubs and bars in which you drink have been the most solid, with a homogeneous increase above the drop in restaurants.
Even the pubs where you eat have suffered heat, but not too much like restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars managed the sales of drinks are 6.6 per cent a month, while food consumption dropped by 3 per cent".
Paul Newman, an analyst in the recreational and reception sector of RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting events remain the main factor when it comes to retailing.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to fight, although a decrease in sales of 4.8 per cent per annum will be particularly serious in addition to the ongoing cost pressures.
The long warm summer could not have come in a worse period for the restaurants and only time can tell if the most moderate temperatures, which we enjoyed in August, will give us a necessary response."
The overall growth of sales between pubs and restaurants, including the new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the decline in the roll-outs of the brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales monitoring company for pubs, bars and British restaurants collects and analyzes performance data through 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over 9 billion sterlings, and is the industry reference company.
A child on five owns social network secrets account that hides parents
A survey reveals that a child over five, some of only 11 years old, has secret accounts of social networks that hide to parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the "Fake on Instagram" pages
The news has reinforced the fear that sexual content is being put on hold.
20 percent of students said they had a "main" account to show parents
A child in five, some of whom are only 11 years old, creates social networks accounts that keep adults hidden.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in the "fake on Instagram" account, a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has reinforced the fear that sexual content is being put on hold.
Twenty percent of students claimed to manage a "principal" account to show their parents, while maintaining a private account.
A mother who accidentally discovered the secret site of the 13th-century daughter found a teenager who urged others to "strange me".
The research, the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of private schools, showed that 40 percent of boys between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, and half of them have allowed to keep private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eliid Doyle will be "voice for athletes" to the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilid Doyle was elected non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Council during the National General Assembly of the Administrative Authority.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete of light athletics and President Ian Beattie described the nomination as a great opportunity for those who manage sports to benefit from their wide international experience in the last decade.
"Eilidh enjoys a deep respect for the Scottish, British and world athletic community and we are sure that in Scotland the athletics could bring a huge advantage by bringing it within the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I don't see the time to act as an athlete's voice and hope to be able to contribute and help drive sports in Scotland."
The American, a winner of 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games and four Olympic Gold Medaglies, as well as currently an opinionist of the BBC, was unable to walk following a transitional ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time could tell if I'd been arrested and to what extent.
It was an extensive job, but I got caught up in everything, learned to walk again, and today I'm moving agile!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!".
The advertising of a shooting sets against mothers and cows and divides online opinion
A producer company of a tornado shared its opinion online with an advertisement that compares mothers who breast-feed and cows that are raised.
To mark the launch of what is defined as "the world's first silent and unbearable shooting", the consumer technology company Elvie launched an advertisement in the form of funny music videos to show the freedom to express itself as mothers given by the new shooting.
Four real mothers dance in a herd of cows on a track that includes songs such as: "Yes, I shoot my milk but I don't have one thing" and "If I hadn't noticed, these aren't nipples but my tits".
The choir continues: "Take it out, throw it out, feed the children, throw it out, throw the milk out to my lord."
However, advertising, published on the company’s Facebook page, has caused online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video generated different reactions among the viewers, many of whom supported that it highlighted the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"A sad decision is to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they also have to remain pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their children are stolen a few days from their birth," someone wrote.
The Elvie stripper wears discreetly under a mother's dress
Someone else commented: "Early traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use it to publish a comic book for mothers who will continue to hold their children?"
Someone else added, "It's really pointless advertising."
Others have defended her, and a woman has even admitted to finding the song " fun".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I'm still breast-feeding myself, I'd like one.
When I used the trigger, I felt like a cow.
Advertising is a bit irrevocable, but it is not far from reality.
This is a great product," someone wrote.
Another person commented: "This is a fun advertisement dedicated to mothers who use the tie (often in the workplace or in the bathroom) and feel like "little."
Its purpose is not to praise or judge the domestic industry."
At the end, the protagonists of the video show that they danced with the discreet tyrant in the regiment.
The concept to which the campaign is inspired is based on the idea that many women who use the tie feel like cows.
However, Elvie is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be infiltrated into a nursing home giving women the freedom to move, hold the children in arms and even go out while they are milking.
Ana Balarin, Mother's partner and ECD commented: "Elvie's tie is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
Comparing the women who use the tie to the cows we wanted to highlight all the challenges of this practice by showing in a fun and easily recognizable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new tie is able to ensure."
This is not the first time Elvie's been reporting.
During the London fashion week, the mother of two children presented herself on the stylist Marta Jakubowski's walkway wearing this product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent on the Texas border
The number of migrant children has increased exponentially even though the monthly crossings of the borders have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the rhetorical hard and political line of the Trump administration have made it more difficult to trust these children.
Most of those who relied on them were usually illegal immigrants who now fear to reinstate the possibility of staying in the country by offering to do so.
The risk was increased in June when the federal authorities announced that the trusted potential and other adult members of their families would be fingerprinted and that the data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had offered to hire children alone.
Later, the Agency confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Almost 80% of the people who offer to hire children or belong to the families of these people are illegal in the country and most of them are criminals.
We are therefore continuing to hunt these people," Albence said.
To try to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules, some of which will have to appear in court within one month of the firm, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard period, according to those who work in the reception points.
Many will appear in videoconferencing rather than in person, to speak their case of legal status at an immigration judge.
Those who will be considered unfit for aid will be expelled quickly.
The longer the children remain in trust, the more they are at risk of anxiety and depression that cause violent attacks of anger or attempts to escape, as they say those who work in reception points and the relationships that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Those who support this position say that the probability of this happening is even higher in a large structure like that of Tornillo in which, due to its size, it is easier to ignore the signs of children's discomfort.
They add that moving children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or greet their friends could make the trauma that many are already facing worse.
Syria intimates the U.S., French and Turkish employment forces to withdraw immediately
In his speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also invited Syrian refugees to return to their homeland, even if the war had already reached the eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces illegally occupy Syrian soil with the intention of combating terrorism and will "be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately without setting any conditions," he said in front of the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where since 2011, there have been more than 360,000 deaths and millions of people have had to leave their homes.
He reiterated that Damascus will continue to "fight this holy war until it has freed all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from "any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and support the Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the field in this country destroyed by the war.
On the problem of refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions are favourable to their return and accused "some Western countries" of "incuting inflamed fears" that push refugees to stay away from their homeland.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to intervene to facilitate their return," he said.
"That should only be a humanitarian problem is politicized."
The United States and the European Union have announced that aid for reconstruction will not be allocated in Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a coscinet area in Idlib, the last major rock fortress of the rebels, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has avoided an extensive attack by the Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem nevertheless stressed that the agreement has "precise deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action will target the jihadists, including the fighters of the Al-Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, who will "be eradicated".
The United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to be able to soon convene a new committee of government and opposition members to extend a post-war constitution to Syria and prepare the way for the elections.
Moualem has set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the work of the group should be limited to "revision of the articles of the current constitution" without any interference.
Why Trump will be awarded the second term
Based on this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators may hope, its presidency should not end prematurely because of an impeachment or scandal.
In what will undoubtedly be "the finale of the most dramatic presidency of all time!"
At the moment, there's no sign of the viewer's bending.
Since 2014, the percentages of the first night are more than doubled up to 1.05 million on the CNN and almost tripled up to 1.6 million on the MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the first evening, in fact increasing from 1.7 million to four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show program has exceeded the percentages of the network reaching 3.5 million viewers in the evenings with the most important news.
"It's a fire to which people are attracted because it's not something that can be explained," says Neal Baer, showrunner of ABC's television series "Designed Survival" who tells the story of a cabinet member who suddenly becomes president after an attack that destroys the Campidoglio.
In Scovell, an expert writer of brilliant comedy and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", he has another theory.
It remembers a taxi race in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he'd vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
He said, "Why does he make me laugh?"
So chaos is a source of entertainment.
Of course, unlike any other television program, Washington's layout can determine the future of Roe vs. Wade's sentence, whether immigrant families can meet or not and the health status of the global economy.
However, to stop following the news is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it goes well beyond the duty of informed citizens to follow for the sixth hour a group of experts who discuss Bob Woodward's in-depth research for his book "Peara", of Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather jacket ("a dress full of anxiety" commented The Washington Post) and the implications of the disgusting descriptions that Stormy Daniels makes of Trump's anatomical parts.
For example, I won't be able to watch Super Mario without thinking.
"Part of the reason why what makes a reality show is that every night there is novelty," says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of "Pawn Stars", regarding the performance of actors and daily developments of Trump's show (in contrast with N.F.L. which commends Kim Jong-un).
You can't lose an episode, otherwise stay back.
This week I went to find Mike Fleiss on the northern coast of Kauai and although it was a sunny day with almost 30 degrees, he was locked up at home looking at MSNBC and meanwhile he was recording CNN.
He failed to get out of the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate's judicial committee and in the face of the uncertain future of the Supreme Court.
Fleiss commented: "I remember when we were doing all those ridiculous programs and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization."
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

External cash flow in the race for the most closed elections of half-managed
It is not surprising that in the 17th district there is a cash flow due to the alignment of a congressional district which has made it possible that two members in charge are now running for the same place.
The recent redefinition of Pittsburg's suburban district brings into play Democratic Representative Conor Lambb, who won his place in another district during a special election held last spring.
Lamb is running against another member in charge, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Pennsylvania that overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that in the old districts electoral colleges were unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of the republicans.
The 17th district race sparked a campaign characterized by fierce opposition between the financial branches of the two major parties, namely the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a victory of measurement in the special elections in March for the 18th Congressal District of Pennsylvania.
That place was occupied by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump awarded the district for 20 points.
Political opinionists have given democratics a slight advantage.
The United States thought to penalize El Salvador because it supports China, then changed its mind
Diplomatics have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017 a rather friendly meeting took place between the President of Panama Juan Carlos Varela and President Trump who also had a hotel in Panama until the partners forced the leader group of the Trump Organisation to leave.
Officials of the Department of State have decided to include the heads of the American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following the "recent decision not to recognise Taiwan anymore", said the spokesman of the Heather Naurut department in a statement issued at the beginning of the month.
However, the decision to apply sanctions was made only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million from Americans in aid to control drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on visas, would be of concern to the Central American country with a high percentage of unemployed and killed.
After a number of internal meetings, officials from North America and Central America left a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in trying to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials made it clear that they intended to continue with the conference, thus definitively abandoning any sanctions imposed on El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has been tasked with chairing the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, to demonstrate the importance that the administration attaches to this meeting, the diplomats say.
And the three American envoys returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without receiving further messages of reprisal or punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton at the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials and two diplomats who agreed to speak, in an anonymous manner, of internal decisions.
What they told was confirmed by an external analyst near the administration who nevertheless wanted to keep the anonymity.
Study history
In the report he will publish, Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller could accuse Trump of obstructing justice, which seems to already have sufficient evidence.
According to what is said, Mueller's investigation aims to shed light on Trump's possible collapse with Russia during the presidential campaign.
If Congress were to pass on to the Democrats, Trump should respond to these charges before the voters and perhaps to a jury of its own while preparing for a new candidacy.
The unknown are many and I do not intend to say that Trump's fall is inevitable, as it is not that of his counterparts in Europe.
In both sides of the Atlantic, we will have to make choices that will determine how long the fight could last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to organize a coup d'état against Hitler if the Western powers had stopped him and supported the Czechoslovakians in Monaco.
On that occasion, we failed to escape the opportunity to avoid the years of carneficination that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points where the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans have to deal with different things right now.
What would happen if Trump decided to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's position has been complicated ever since this newspaper reported that last year it secretly suggested submitting Trump to interceptions, questioning his ability to cover up the role of president.
Rosenstein argues that the news on The Times is not true.
"How will we react if the FBI's new investigation into Brett Kavanaugh will not be complete or impartial or if it will be confirmed to the Supreme Court in spite of credible allegations of attempted rape and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that will ask Trump to respond to his actions?
If we do not overcome these tests, democracy will have to prepare for a long winter.
But the lesson I learned in Prague makes me think we'll do it.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, moved to America, and, 60 years later, she sent me to light the candles of the Sabbath with the candle.
With such an inheritance, I can only be optimistic about the future."

Graham Dorans dei Rangers is optimistic about meeting with the Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the convincing match against the Villareal in Spain, would give them the best opportunity to qualify for the Group G of Europe League.
Although due to an accident at the knee, the central camper Graham Dorrans played his first match of the season right on the occasion of the 2-2 match with the Villareal, he believes that this result can allow the Rangers to do great things.
"For us it was a positive result because the Villareal is a good team," said the 30-year-old player.
"We faced the game convinced of doing good and took a point home.
Perhaps we could have won in extremism, but, all in all, the balance is a good result.
They were better in the first time, while in the second we played better.
As far as Thursday is concerned, it will be another great European evening.
We hope to win the three points but it will be a difficult meeting because our opponents have achieved a good result in the last match. I am sure, however, that, thanks to the support of the public, we will not fail.
Last year was certainly difficult because of my accidents and changes at the club level itself but now the sensations are positive.
The team is in shape, the boys have fun and the preparation is good.
So we can forget the problems of the last season and think about the future."
Women are concerned about the long-term costs of assistance
Although those involved in the survey have clear ideas about the type of assistance they would like to receive, few have addressed the issue in the family.
About half of the nationwide interviewees said they had talked to their wife about the cost of long-term assistance.
Only 10% said they had spoken to their children.
According to Holly Snyder, vice president of the insurance sector on the life of Nationwide, "people want to be a member of their family to take care of them, but do not face this conversation".
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to attend if you do not communicate for a while what you want.
If you have a consultant, decide with him and your family where and how you want assistance, because these factors can be decisive for the costs.
Involve a financial consultant: you can advise how to pay the costs you will have to deal with.
The choice of long-term assistance funding may include a traditional insurance policy or a hybrid life-saving policy to cover these expenses or continue to pay for insurance until you are able to do so.
Prepare all necessary documents to avoid legal battles at your death.
Designate a health care prosecutor so that a person you trust can supervise medical care and make sure that professionals satisfy your wishes if you have not been able to communicate.
Also evaluate the possibility of a search for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and make sure that your accounts are paid if you have not been able to do so.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your old parent is being taken urgently to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write this information in detail so that you can always be ready.
"It's not just a financial issue, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Prepare for any event."
Man hit several times with an air gun compressed in Ilfracombe
A man was hit several times with a compressed-air rifle while he was on foot after spending the night out.
The victim, a quarter-year-old, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit by the chest, abdomen and one hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as "accidental action".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
He's not in danger of life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official sources, at least 384 people died as a result of a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. The victim's budget is intended to rise.
Communications have been interrupted and the aid authorities have failed to have any information from the Dongala Regency, a zone north of Palu near the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated by Palu.
Here are some essential data on Palu and Dongala in the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi Centrale, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi and with a population of about 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
When it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regiment that extends over 300 km (180 miles) of coast in the north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The regent, an administrative region dependent on a province, had about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of support for the economy of the Central Sulawesi province and, above all, of the coastal region of Dongala.
The extraction of nickel is also an important activity in the province, but it is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesia Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
Another tsunami struck the western zone of Dongala in 1996 killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the so-called Pacific fire belt area and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the strongest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December a very strong earthquake on the western coast of the province of Aceh north of Sumatra caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries killing, along the coast of the Indian Ocean, 226,000 people, including over half of Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: a magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern area of Giva, the most popular island in Indonesia, causing a tsunami that broke out against the southern coast killing almost 700 people.
2009: a magnitude 7.6 earthquake fell near the city of Padang, capital of the Western province of Sumatra.
The victims were over 1,100.
2010: a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands, away from Sumatra, causing a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: a slight earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya in Aceh regiment causing destruction and panic in people who recalled the devastation of the earthquake and tsunamis in 2004.
In this case there were no tsunamis, but more than 100 people died under the mattress.
2018: a strong earthquake hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia killing more than 500 people, most of whom in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former Alaskan governor and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested with the charge of aggression.
On the basis of a statement issued Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, Palin, 29 years old, by Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence, for having obstructed the complaint and for resisting arrest.
According to the report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he ripped her phone off her hand.
Palin was transferred to the Mat-Su Pretria Facility centre and his bail was set at $500, based on what KTUU reported.
According to the television network, it appeared in Saturday's judgment and declared itself "safely innocent".
Palin is at risk of being charged with three first-degree crimes, namely detention up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He was also assigned a second-degree punishable offence with a day of detention and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time Palin's been charged with criminal acts.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to signal the alleged assault.
The case is currently being examined by the Veteran's Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic aggression, having prevented the complaint of the crime and possession of a weapon while he was drunk in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her with a fist on her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterinary groups in 2016 for linking the violent behavior of the child to post-traumatic stress syndrome following the period in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
The electricity network and the communications network do not work, and the budget of the victims is intended to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck far from Sulawesi Centrale, which is north-east of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Social media broadcast videos that show the moment of impact.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu.
Federal Prosecutors Ask for the Extraordinary Capital Penalty for Suspects of Terrorist Attacks at NYC
The federal prosecutors in New York ask for the capital penalty for Sayfillo Saipov, author of the terrorist attack that caused the death of eight people: a rare penalty that since 1953 has never been committed for a federal crime.
Saipov, 30 years old, is accused of using a Home Depot rental van to flow on a cyclable track along the West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan area by investing pedestrians and cyclists in October.
On the basis of the conditions for the request for capital punishment in the southern district of New York, to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov has "intendedly" killed the eight victims and has also "intendedly" suffered serious bodily injuries.
According to the court document, both of these defendants may lead to the death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, a large federal jury issued Saipov 22 prosecutors who included eight charges of murder with criminal association, usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and a charge of violence and car destruction.
The attack called for "a real planning and pre-meditation," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov brought it to an end as "atrocious, cruel and devious".
The preliminary notification states that "Sayfull Habibullahevic Saipov has caused damage, injuries and losses to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco".
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been ten years since New York's southern district persecuted the last case of capital punishment.
The man mentioned in the trial, Khalid Barnes, was accused of the murder of two drug traffickers but was eventually sentenced to death in September 2009.
The death sentence was last executed in New York in 1953 for the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, husbands and wives accused of conspiracy through espionage and criminalized for passing information to the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg spouses both died on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, the native of Uzbekistan, showed no sign of repentance in the days and months following the attack.
The police say in front of the investigators they were proud of what they did.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that he had decided to complete the attack after watching video of the ISIS on his phone.
He also asked the police to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
In the case of the 22 chief tax officers, it has been declared not guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, was said "of course disappointed" by the decision of the accused.
"We believe that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt and condemning it to ecstasy without any possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's group of defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Member of the Tory Parliament states that NIGEL FARAGE must conduct the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today swore to "mobilize the popular army" during a protest at the Tory conference.
When one of Parliament's members of Theresa May's party suggested that he should deal with the negotiations with the European Union, the former leader of the UK's Independence Party said that politicians should "feel the pressure" of the Eurosceptics.
In March, Conservative Member Peter Bone said in Birmingham that the United Kingdom "would already be out of Europe" if Farage was the Secretary for Brexit.
But the challenges that May has to face in trying to reconcile the positions of its deeply divided party have been underlined by the Torys in favour of staying in Europe who have participated in a separate protest against Brexit in London.
The Prime Minister is trying to implement the Chequers Plan between Brexit's supporters' attacks, of those who want to remain in Europe and the European Union.
The Allies insist on continuing their efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the strong collective reaction, and forcing Eurosceptics and Labourers to choose between what May proposes and "chaos".
At the start of the organisation Leave Means Leave held in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to leave the Chequers Plan.
He suggested that the task of conducting negotiations with Brussels should have been entrusted to Farage.
"We would be out of Europe by now," he said.
Members of Parliament Wellingborough added: "I am for Brexit but we must abandon the Chequers Plan".
Explaining his opposition to the European Union, he said: "We have not fought world wars to be helpful.
We want to be able to apply our laws in our country."
Bone rejected the views that the public opinion would have changed since the vote in 2016: "The idea that the British have changed the idea and want to remain in Europe is completely false."
Parliamentarian Tory Andrea Jenkyns, a supporter of Brexit, also participated in the court and told reporters: "I just tell the prime minister to listen to people.
The Chequers Plan is not appreciated by the public in general, the opposition will not vote on it and does not enjoy the favor of our party and our activists who turn to the streets for votes to allow us to be elected.
Let's lose the Chequers Plan and start listening."
In an incisive message for May, he added: "The prime ministers can keep their place when they keep their promises."
At first, Farage said that politicians should be able to " feel pressure" if they intended to betray the decision taken with the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't let him."
In a message for the enthusiastic crowd he added: "I want you to feel the pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We intend to mobilize the popular army of this country that has voted for Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, those in favour of staying in Europe marched for the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour start in the city centre.
An executive number of activists pushed the Tory against Brexit's flags after the group was formed this weekend.
The Labourer laughed at the conservatives for the security problems they had with an app from the party at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who say they can install IT systems and all the technology for the Canada Plus Agreement, for the border without attractions and for trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's all a farce.
A good Brexit doesn't exist," he concluded.
Warren is seriously thinking about running for the presidency.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November elections he will think seriously if he applies for the presidency.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democratic Senator of Massachusetts on Saturday spoke about his future during a city assembly in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, often criticizing President Donald Trump, is a candidate for the November re-election against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
The assumption that could challenge Trump in 2020 was already in the air.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with voters in the form of a city assembly since Trump settled in.
One participant asked her if she was going to run for the presidency.
Warren replied that it is now that "women go to Washington to regulate the government, and this implies that a woman takes the highest charge".
Arrested for the murder of the LSU Sims player
The Baton Rouge police in Louisiana on Saturday reported that they arrested a suspect for the murder of the LSU's Wayde Sims basketball player on Friday.
Baton Rouge's police department announced the arrest of Diteon Simpson, 20 years old, at 11:00 on ETNews.
On Friday he had broadcast a murder video asking for help in identifying a man visible in the sequences.
Sims, 20 years old, was hit and killed near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims reported a gunshot wound to the head that caused death," said police chief Murphy J. Paul on 247Sports.
Wayde intervened to defend a friend and was hit by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene of the crime in possession of a gun and that he had hit Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and detained in a state of constant detention at the Parish Police Department of East Baton Rouge.
Junior player of almost two meters grew up in Baton Rouge, last season Sims competed for 32 meetings of which 10 were to be held with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after victory on Sebastian Vettel thanks to the team's orders
When on Saturday Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of his partner Lewis Hamilton, it was immediately clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would have severely conditioned the race.
From the pole, Bottas goes well leaving Hamilton to defend himself against Vettel's attacks in the first two rounds.
Vettel stops first at the boxes leaving Hamilton in the group's tail traffic, which could be decisive.
Mercedes pauses the next turn back into the track behind Vettel. Hamilton, however, surpasss it after some wheel-a-wheel actions in which the Ferrari pilot tries to prevent the passage inside by risking to end up after a double move to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen leaves from the last row of the grid but at the end of the first round is already seventh on the day of his 21st birthday.
Therefore, guide the race for most of the race without stopping at the boxes for the change of tires and try to finish quickly to overcome Kimi Raikkonen by winning the fourth place.
At the end, however, it must stop the pit at the 44th round and in the remaining 8 rounds it is not able to increase the step and overcome Raikkonen, which reaches the room.
"It's a hard day because Valtteri worked very well all weekend and was really nice to let me through.
The team did an exceptional job to win the first and second positions," Hamilton said.
A bad example of body language
Early on Saturday, Senator Diane Feinstein was surrounded by President Donald Trump for his insistence on not revealing the contents of Christine Blasey Ford's letter that accused of attempted rape of the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
During a commission in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what is happening in the Senate proves that people are "mechanics, bad and lying".
"What can happen and what is happening in the last days in the Senate where people are angry, mean, bad and lying," he said.
"When there are clear signs that the news is being disclosed and those responsible say, "Oh no, it wasn't me.
I could never do that."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you get the news?
Remember your answer... did you reveal the contents of the document? - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't do it."
Wait a minute.
We discovered it...No, we didn't do it" he added by imitating the senator.
The letter in which the Ford accuses Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July and the content was disclosed at the beginning of September, but Feinstein denied that the indiscretion was intertwined by his office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's accusations, but I didn't reveal his story," Feinstein told the committee, as reported by The Hill.
"He asked me to keep the confidential information, and I did."
But his denial is not credible for the president, who, during the beginning of Saturday night, commented: "I tell you, this is just a bad example of the body's language.
Maybe he didn't, but this is the worst example of body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidate to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of attempted sexual offence by three women, the president suggested that the democrats are using these charges for their own purposes.
"They are trying to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the evil, the evil. They don't care who harms, who must pass over to regain power and control," said the president as reported by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars recovered after the defeat of Friday in the Elite League match against the Belfast Giants by winning the return race for 5-3 Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants immediately took advantage of two goals on the shootings of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the house team to the bet before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the advantage.
Francois Bouchard marked the match for the Dundee before two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen decreed their victory.
It was the third defeat of the Elite League season for the men of Adam Keefe who had won the match with the Dundee for 2-1 on Friday night in Belfast.
The two teams have already met four times this season and the Giants have won the first three matches.
Dwyer scored the first goal at 3:35 on Kendall McFaul's assistant, while Beauvilier doubled after four minutes on David Rutherford's assistant.
In what was a fairly animated first time, Sullivan brought home team in departure at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt provided the partner's assistant to Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer decreed the advantage for the Giants by marking the second goal of the evening at the end of the first time.
The home team went together and Bouchard rejuvenated the bet after a strategic maneuver at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran contributed to Nielsen's action that led the Dundee to the advantage for the first time in meeting at the end of the second time and decreed the victory of his team by marking the fifth goal in the middle of the last time.
The Giants, who have lost four of the last five meetings at this point, will play the next home game in Milton Keynes on Friday.
Flight controller dies to allow hundreds of passengers to escape to the earthquake
In Indonesia, a flight controller will be hailed as a hero after he was killed to allow an aircraft that carried hundreds of people to take them safely.
More than 800 people are dead and many are scattered because of a very strong earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday causing a tsunami.
Heavy relief escorts continue to interest the area and many are intertwined among the maceries in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues had fled to save their lives, twenty-one Anthonius Gunavan Agung remained in his place in the control tower of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport of Palu, which was trembling.
He wanted to make sure Batik Air 6321, which was on the track, was able to take off safely.
So he threw himself out of the control tower when he thought he was going to crash himself.
He died later at the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesperson Yohannes Sirat said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, as reported by the Australian ABC News issuer.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It's really sad news for us," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities fear that the number of victims can reach the thousands and the national disaster disaster disaster agency will indicate that access to the cities of Donganga, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The count of the dead is intended to increase because many bodies are still under the mattresses and it has been impossible to reach many others," explains Sutopo Purwo Nugroho's spokesman.
Where up to 6 meters have destroyed Palu, where a mass burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are transporting aid and living.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance carries bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-arkets are packed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is doing its best to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
The situation is already tragic, but it could be much worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the men of the country's army: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation activities.
Are you ready?", according to CNN.
During the year Indonesia had already been hit by earthquakes in Lombok, where 550 people had died.
Aerial Disaster in Micronesia: Air Niugini now claims that there is a dispersal after the lagoon crash
The airline that fell into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, after stating that all 47 people on board between passengers and crew members had managed to save themselves, now argues there is a dispersion.
According to Air Niugini news, updated on Saturday afternoon, a passenger misses the call.
The airline has confirmed that it is in contact with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for further details on the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local vessels have saved the other passengers and the crew after the incident while the aircraft was trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
According to official sources, on Friday, seven people were transported to the hospital.
The airline states that six passengers were taken to the hospital on Saturday and are all in stable conditions.
What has caused the incident and the exact sequence of events is not yet clear.
The United States airline and the Navy claim that the plane is rushed into the lagoon because it did not reach the track.
Some witnesses claim that the plane crossed the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane arrived at a very low level.
"Ed was really a fortune," Jaynes said.
Jaynes then explained that he and others, walking in the water that came to life, were able to reach the emergency exits of the plane.
He added that the flight attendants got themselves panicked and yelled and that he was slightly hit on the head.
According to the U.S. Navy, even some sailors who were working nearby to arrange a bridge have helped by using a dome to transport people on the shore before the plane crashed in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicate that in the last two decades 111 people have died in aircraft incidents of the lines registered with PNG but none of them have involved Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the night of the woman burned alive
On Saturday we concluded the presentation of the evidence of the accusation in the new process against an accused man who burned a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
The analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone data to rebuild the movements of the twenty-nine accused Quinton Tellis and the ten-nine-nine victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
As reported by The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed to have recovered the location data from several cells that demonstrate that, contrary to what she said, Tellis was with the Chambers the night she was killed.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with the Chambers during the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke with Sanford.
Sanford went to court Saturday and testified that that day wasn't in town.
When the public ministry asked him if Tellis was telling the truth saying that that night was in Sanford's truck, he confirmed that he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency is that Tellis has said to know Chambers for two weeks when she died.
Cell phone data indicate that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that after the death of the Chambers, Tellis removed the messages, calls and contact information from the Chambers from his phone.
"He canceled it from his life," Hale said.
The defence will begin its final argument Sunday.
The judge provides that the trial will take place later on the same day.
The High Breed: what is the hip-hop conscious?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative vision of this kind by inserting positive messages into its tracks.
The The High Breed Group, from Bristol, argues that the hip-hop was far away from its origins when spreading political messages and reporting social problems.
Instead, they want to return to their origins and make again a kind of conscious hip-hop.
Artists such as the Fugees and Commons have recently grown up in the United Kingdom thanks to characters like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
A New York father quoted a couple in court for having fired her with a "racist" text
In New York a father quoted a couple in court for discriminating her after receiving a wrong text in which his mother complained that she was "another black".
The couple refuses to be racist by comparing the request to a real "storage".
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, mother of two children, expressed his disappointment when he discovered that the new father, Giselle Maurice, arrived for his first day of work in 2016, was black.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER NERA," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Faxman in a message for her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after having noticed the mistake, Mrs. Plasco-Faxman "embarked" fired Ms. Maurice, saying she was not happy with their former father, an African American, and was expecting a Filipino.
She paid Ms. Maurice the day she worked and sent her home with a cab.
Maurice mentioned the couple in court and, to be fired, she asked for compensation for the beauty of 350 dollars a day for the six full-time work months for which she was initially hired, even without a contract.
"I want them to understand that they can't behave like this," he said to the Post Friday, adding, "I know it's a discrimination."
The couple responded to the charge of racism by claiming that the Maurice's dismissal was the only thing to do because they were afraid they could not trust her after she had offended her.
"My wife sent you a message in which she said something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist people," said Joel Plasco's husband.
"Would you trust your children with someone you've been escorted with, even if it's wrong?
Your baby?
I don't think so."
Comparing the request to a true "extortion", Plasco has said that the wife has been born for just two months and is in a "very difficult situation".
"There can't be a person like that.
It is not very kind of behavior," the financial consultant added.
While the legal case is still underway, the public opinion court has brought complaints against the spouses on social media by strongly criticising them for their behavior and for the logic followed.
A letter reveals that the editor of Paddington feared that readers would not appreciate a talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was accepted, comments on the letter as follows: "It is not easy to get into the hands of those who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's fun now that we know the great success of Paddington."
Claiming that the father, who was working as a cameraman at BBC before writing the book for children inspired by a playwright, would not have responded well to the rejection of his work, adds that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was a bit "sad" after his death last year.
About Paddington, who she describes as "a very important member of our family" adds that the father was modestly proud of his success.
"He was a pretty quiet man, not a supposed person," he said.
"But Paddington was so real to him that he behaved like when you have a son who achieves a goal: you're proud even if it's not yours.
I think he interpreted Paddington's success this way.
Although it was a creation of his imagination, he attributed the merit to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my daughter's phone that was dying.
Upon landing, the daughter was urgently transported to the hospital of Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad called me several times to tell me that the situation was really serious and that our daughter wouldn't have done it," says Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then he called me to tell me that she was going to die in a few minutes and that I had to say good-bye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of the medications given by the doctors to allow the heart to continue pumping was slowly exacerbating.
She died a little while before and it was over.
I had to sit down and wait knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't complain, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on to it."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, grieving for the loss of her daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers who were not aware of what was happening to her.
"No one knew," he said.
"For all the time I've done nothing but cry low.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane, I felt an incredible sense of solidarity with Nad.
I thought he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two grieving women's tickets to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide are committed to preventing others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys attacked on a bridge in Wales tickets with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and died at 18.
"I don't want no parent to feel like I feel every day," he says.
Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, tells me that his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knows him for his smile.
They always said that it lit every room in which it entered."
But before he died, he left the job because depression had brought him to "a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after he took his life.
Davis says, "I'm still afraid there's a chain effect."
He created the tickets "to let people know that there is someone they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
They don't have to isolate themselves, they have to talk."
Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies for years, lost Mark, his 15-year-old companion, not long after his mother died.
"You never said you felt down or depressed," she says.
"A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude was changed.
Christmas Day touched the bottom. When the children opened the presents, he avoided looking them in the eyes."
He says that his death was a huge trauma that they had to develop: "He lashed the family.
He made us pieces.
But we had to move forward and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain: the FBI has started investigations
"I think that if we could proceed as he asked, or with a limited investigation in time and scope, we could reach an agreement," Flake said Saturday, saying, fearing that the committee itself "lost calm" because of the blockade of the root supporters.
Why don't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI indicted?
Their reluctance is due to the choice of time.
Only five weeks are left for the mid-term elections, November 6th. If Republicans as expected will get a negative result, they will be severely weakened in their attempt to elect the man they have chosen for the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senators under pressure to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and, thanks to him, met Ashley's wife, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI has completed its report?
You will vote in the Senate, which is currently made up of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh will succeed in obtaining at least 50 votes to the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break the indus and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of political refugees in North Korea "decreases" with Kim
A South Korean legislator claims that the number of North Koreans seeking political asylum in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came into power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Ministry of South Korea's unification, claims that refugees were 1.127 last year against 2,706 of 2011.
Mr Park explains that the main reasons are a stricter control of the border between North Korea and China and the highest rates of demand from those who make these people go out illegally.
Pyongyang has not issued public statements.
The vast majority of refugees in North Korea are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, whose border with North Korea is longer and easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers them to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them with strength.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
This month the two countries have already met in Pyongyang to discuss negotiations on denuclearisation which are in a state of emergency.
This after the historic June meeting between the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, in which they agreed in general terms to cooperate to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticised the US sanctions for the lack of development since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of our national security and in these circumstances there is no possibility that we are going to unilateral disarmament for the first time," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi defines Brett Kavanaugh as "historic" and argues that it is not suitable for the Supreme Court
The leader of the Nancy Pelosi minority defines the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh as "historic" and claims that it is not characteristicly suitable to cover this task.
Pelosi expressed this opinion on Saturday in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I think if a woman had acted the same way, they would have defined her as a wife," said Pelosi on Thursday's statement before the Senate's judicial committee.
Apparently excited, Kavanaugh denied the charge of sexually harassing Professor Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At the beginning of his speech, Kavanaugh was in the forefront of emotion, so much so that he could almost scream and with the close throat of the crying while talking about his family and the years at the high school.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's democrats who have defined charges against him as an "absolute and coordinated defamation campaign" organised by the angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelos believes that Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he cannot enter the Supreme Court because he has proved to be prevented from against the democrats.
"I think he has been self-exclusion with his statements and the way he spoke about Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi then raised an objection when asked whether he would try to put Kavanaugh in a position of accusation in the event it was confirmed and whether the Democrats should reach the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I think that if you don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, it's not only not suitable for the Supreme Court, but also for the court that now presides," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Court of Appeal for the Circuit of the District of Columbia.
Peloso added that, as a democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe vs. Wade, because he was considered a conservative judge.
In the hearing for his confirmation, Kavanaugh raised questions about his intentions to overthrow certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi stated that "You cannot send a female person to the Supreme Court and claim that this decision is welcomed in a positive way".
And women have to use it.
It's a right diatribu, months and years of anger attacks from which he can't get out without crying.
"We cry when we leave," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do you?"
And she continued, "She helped me a woman who was leading somewhere. She told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique so when she was angry and started to cry she said to the person she was talking to "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then he went on.
I thought yours was a brilliant idea."
The tears are tolerated as a effusion of anger in part because they are basically not understood.
One of the brightest memories that I have of a previous job in a male-prevalence office is when I once cried for an angry access. An older woman than me, an ice-cream manager from whom I had always been slightly terrified took me for a collar and dragged me along the stairs.
"Don't ever see you cry," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're happy to have you in their hands."
Patricia Schroeder, then a democratic member of the Colorado Congress, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential run.
In 1987, when on a boat called Monkey Business was discovered Hart's extramarital relationship that he had to give up the race, Schroeder, very disappointed, thought there was no reason why he should not have tried to run for the presidency himself.
"It wasn't really a well-balanced decision," she told me, "retiring us 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and there was certainly no need for another one.
Someone called them "Biancanev and the Seven Nanes."
Since the campaign was already in an advanced phase, Schroeder was late for fundraising and swore that she would not have applied if she had not collected $2 million.
It was a lost cause in the beginning.
He found that some of the supporters who had given the candidates $1,000 would only give her 250.
"Do you think I can get a discount?" he asked.
When he had the speech to announce that he would not have launched an official campaign, he was so overwhelmed by the emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported him, disappointment towards the system that made it harder to find money and voters than representatives and anger for the sexual discrimination he was a victim of), which he committed.
"He seemed to be precipitating a nervous breakdown," recalled Schroeder, thinking about the reaction of the press.
"Someone might have thought that Kleinex was my company sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they would have written on my stone.
Maybe "Pianse a lot."
How the US-China trade war could favor Beijing
The impact of the opening up of the trade war between the US and China has been fragile and, while the battle is all but concluded, experts say that a contrast between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, has already launched the first warning this year by taxing the main Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new duties on articles for more than $200 billion (175 billion) of value, which means that taxes will be applied on half of Chinese goods.
Beijing has reacted every time with measures of the same type, recently applying duties from five to ten percent of US$ 60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the U.S. strike and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economic power will soon go back.
Because Washington would have to give up on his demands, but getting public to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of trade war with the United States can have a positive impact on China over the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision by Washington or Beijing can create the initial conditions of an economic collapse in both countries is in fact much more dangerous than what has been recognised so far," says Abigail Grace, a researcher who studies Asia at the Center for New American Security Research Centre.
Syria is "ready" for the return of refugees, supports the foreign minister
Syria says to be ready for the return of the refugees and is looking for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated since the past seven years of war.
In view of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem has stated that the country's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation on the territory is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to recover areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Now there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their maintenance.
According to the United Nations estimate, more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million who still live in Syria need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime would accept voluntary assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept any aid under the conditions or by those countries that supported the insurrection.
Europe conquers the Ryder Cup in Paris
The Europe team won the Ryder Cup 2018 by beating the US team with a final score of 17.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National out of Paris, France.
The United States has thus lost six consecutive times on European soil and have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points that were used to beat the United States.
The US champion Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, launched his tea shot in the water at the sixteenth hole of the pair 3 granting the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer has distinguished himself in all his tournaments by becoming one of the four players of always making a 5-0-0 record since the tournament with the current formula was first debated in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated with a score of 5–4 by the lower Danish player in the classification Thorbjorn Olesen of the European team.
The world's best player, Dustin Johnson, has landed for 2+1 in English Ian Poulter who could have argued his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, who fought eight of them, became the European player who won more in the tournament's history with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It was a difficult year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to have regained the cup.
It is a victory of the team and I am happy to have contributed," said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
Pass the witness to his native John Ram who beat the US Tiger Woods golf legend with a score of 2–1 in the singles on Sunday.
"If I think I grew up looking at his meetings, I'm really proud to have beaten Tiger Woods," said 20-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now the computation of his meetings in the Ryder Cup is 13 victories, 21 defeats and 3 matches.
A strange statistic if you think he's one of the biggest players of all time having won 14 of the main titles, according to only Jack Nicklus.
The US team has been trying to find the fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have played a high-level golf course throughout the tournament.
Captain US Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: "I'm proud of these guys because they fought.
At some point this morning we put pressure on the European team.
We've thrown away this opportunity.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players behaved very well.
We'll reorganize, work with the American PGA and the Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move on.
I'm in love with these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We've put it all on.
But they played better than us."
