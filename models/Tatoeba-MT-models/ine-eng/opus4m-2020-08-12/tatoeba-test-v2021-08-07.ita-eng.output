White pedone to f3, black pedone to e6, white pedone to g4, black woman to h4 - matted chess! This is funnyly indicated in chess circles as "mock mat".
White: Tower in a1, Pedon in b6, King in c8. Black: Pedon in a7 and b7, King in a8, Alpha in b8. The White puts the opponent in the Zugzwang by playing the Tower in a6, after the Black has only two options: take the Tower in a6 or move his Alpha in any other descent on the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, the White makes his foot move from b6 to b7 and kicks matte. In the second situation, the White Tower takes the Black Foot in a7, with the same result.
