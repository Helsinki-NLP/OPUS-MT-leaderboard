At the end of the trade, the Prague bascula stock exchange in the negative
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the Prague Stock Exchange rectified its losses.
Transactions with ČEZ operations reached almost half of the usual daily trade.
On Tuesday, from the beginning of the trades, the Prague Stock Exchange renewed with its wake-up fall, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall of shares on Wall Street.
The response of the market to the outcome of the vote of the U.S. House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the plan for stabilizing the US financial sector, is also perceived at home.
Breakdown of actions in Asia
Asian scholarships are going through a dramatic fall on Tuesday, even though the indexes manage to erase some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng index of Hong Kong's stock exchange lost four percent during the exchange, but later it cleared some of the losses and reduced the decline by almost 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Index Enterprises following the movement of the Chinese shares of Hong Kong stock exchange lost 3.8%, the markets being closed in Shanghai.
Sydney Stock Exchange has lost more than five percent, but finally, losses are reduced to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
"The hesitation about the US rescue action will affect the financial markets of the world," notes Joseph Yam, head of Hong Kong's monetary office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it sets up its own monetary policy, that is, independent of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong have the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries would be at risk of being affected.
Bloodbathing of American Actions
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the draft financial system support, to which it should have devoted up to $700 billion (about 12 billion Kč).
The legislators thus renegotiate the appeal to support President George Bush's project.
According to Bush, the project should address the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the entire economy.
American actions take place on Monday, a bloodbath and the main indices of actions are the biggest drop in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost almost seven percent, having experienced a fall of such a magnitude for the last time in 1987.
The index was already lost during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in freefall.
Congress gave: US government can inject $700 billion into banks
The leaders of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of the financial assistance agreement to the U.S. financial system.
He shall be put to the vote at the beginning of next week.
U.S. legislators made a key turning point in the negotiations on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance of $700 billion (approximately 12 billion crowns) granted to the US financial system.
Success is not so sure.
In fact, before the final version of the law can be published and voted, Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be discussed at the House of Representatives on Monday.
He said Sunday to Reuters Barney Frank, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Regulation of the House.
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should have been submitted to the Senate vote.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a major first psychological factor in damaging financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms by which aid to markets can be effective, it will follow a "dissolve".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have settled our divergent views on the form which should have the package of measures to stabilize the market," said Nancy Pelosi to the Bloomberg Agency.
According to her, the final vote could be held on Sunday.
On Saturday night to Sunday, representatives of the legislators met the American Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give the government a final form.
It should buy from financial corporations the unsold real estate assets that cause financial companies to suffer significant losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
We still have to pursue this plan to restore markets, but I think we are there," said Paulson.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the declining stock markets.
According to the Democratic Senator Harry Reid, the legislators will ensure that Congress reaches a final agreement on Sunday.
They thus wish to calm down investors before the start of trade in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first hourly zone, where Congress' decision could influence trade on Monday.
At the moment, it is impossible to state with certainty when the two Houses of the American Congress will vote, even if the negotiations are not at risk of being blocked, at the last moment, by such a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
However, the law will still be subject to a number of amendments.
The total amount to be allocated to the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars, as President George Bush wanted, must be available as soon as possible.
However, if Congress feels that the program does not fulfil its function, it has the possibility to block the remaining amount, in two stages: first, an additional $100 billion, then, to end, $350 billion.
Mr. Bush welcomed the progress made in the negotiations
Although the President may vote in favour of this decision, Congress has the option of minority voting.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which was to obtain funds for the purchase of bad real estate securities, including the fall in value, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, has been maintained.
"All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to proceed on Sunday to vote, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
US President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said that Mr. Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bipartite effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of gold parachutes
The chairman of the Banking Committee of Senate Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of the contributors against losses, the agreement on decommissioning, and the progress of the timetable plan.
The new law also provides for the limitation of such gold parachutes for the directors of the companies participating in the programme and establishes a committee to ensure the supervision of the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on the issue and made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and be effective for both the market and all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also provides for assistance for real estate owners, who have problems paying.
The government should negotiate new leases in the case of mortgages it will buy, while reducing debtors' monthlys and allowing the latter to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological assistance
According to the economist head of Patria Finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its realization will be very difficult.
"And this is due to the fact that we do not know what the mechanism and the price of purchasing assets to problems will be.
This point will be crucial to deal with the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," says Marek, this week, to the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan will be adopted now, or at the beginning of next week, it is not, according to Marek, so important.
"It is much more important that Congressmen agree, this week, that they support this plan and that they will devote it to it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, which provides for the adoption of the plan, is most important at this time," Marek said.
Extremely advanced: MP3 players against mobiles.
We'll advise you on how to choose
While almost all mobiles know how to read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only one phone.
It does not prevent enough reasons for seeking an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house a cheap high-end gramophone to put on Maxim Turbulenc's new album.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on a vinyl disc, and, from a quality point of view, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
However, if there are attached vinyl discs in your floors, with art rock, jazz or blues, you dream of at least one such gramophone.
It is the same with music during movements, i.e. compressed music, to say it in a simplified way - music in MP3.
There are also categories based on price and quality.
For one thing, it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a reader, just as a Pink Floyd fan would have a hard time supporting a buyer for twenty crowns on the market.
Here are two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The lifetime of batteries is also crucial
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than a simple music reading, but these are unknown functions, of course, of most of the furniture.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the first functions, phone calls and text messages, he is able to read music and movies, to record the latter, he has a variable-quality camera and may, for example, even be used for navigation.
And if you take the Smartphones and the communicators into account, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no refrigerator can grill the meat and no television will take pictures, we attend almost a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not unfavourable.
The longer the number of functions you use is large, the longer the interval between two recharges will be reduced.
And reading music is one of the most important energy goinfrequents.
It is rare that mobiles that are able to read music for 10 to 12 hours, in most cases this figure is significantly lower.
In this regard, music players (especially the most rudimentary) are much more effective.
In the case of cheap mobiles, tell them that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, it happens to call you from time to time, look for, to be sure, a second reload for work - this is even valid for the most expensive devices.
This problem will not occur for MP3 readers who are capable, following a recharge, of a continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least performing.
Another problem occurs when recording music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices have a USB universal connector, since not all can be directly connected to the computer without a special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but few card players know how to take it without reduction, given the tiny sizes of memory cards used in mobiles.
As for readers, you do not need any software except for iPod.
It is sufficient to complete the music device from the computer through the USB connector.
Most mobile and readers will themselves create a media library classified by the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the style, or then by the user's judgment.
Some devices only display an index with a tree structure, like the Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Crown, intelligent phones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobiles have more know-how
In the choice of a specific device, you are especially interested in the battery life, the memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the ease of command.
If the music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you will listen to it that for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you will have enough of any mobile reading MP3.
Almost all mobile phones are capable of this today.
You are not even obliged to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or the player is able to read.
All can read the MP3 and the great majority of the music that will reach you will have just this format.
It is one of the most common formats and is the exception of it, the vast majority of the devices are also read from WMA-format music.
The AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods) is less common.
High-end furniture also allows, for example, the purchase of online music.
It is enough to visit, from the mobile phone, the corresponding website of the operator (or those of another supplier) and buy the song or album in question.
This service to him alone should be a convincing reason for seeking a musical mobile.
The offer of operators is unfortunate and is limited, in most cases, to fast-acting radio tubes.
The prices are no longer the lowest.
However, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether through GSM, internet, or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their cell phone on their own.
Every time you want to listen to something, you only have to get your mobile out of your pocket, while you have forgotten your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you still have listeners or a handsfree with connection.
If that's not the case, you can use the built-in facilities, which have virtually all the mobiles, but a minimum MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of musical furniture is their price.
The lowest cost is normally less than three thousand.
For a price of three or four thousand crowns, we can have an already very suitable walkman.
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of exit for ordinary listeners.
The price of the best phones and the best tools, also provided by an entrance for ordinary listeners, does not exceed 15 thousand.
On the other hand, readers have the advantage of having an easy command.
Truly, anyone who can secure the control of the most rudimentary readers - who do not necessarily correspond to the least expensive (see our choice).
A minimum function; and the similarity of the order with that of a cassette post, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is evident.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a random-connected mobile Internet, followed by an enormous data transfer invoice.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (the type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
The basic models support in principle only maps with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones even come out with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and you still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Crown, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you must not spend more than 1 100 kroner.
If you are one of the most demanding audiences, choose specialty mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3 and this is how the control's convenience approaches that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles in the walkman series have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that went further in this field.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a battery life (usually 3 p.m., up to 35 p.m.), is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the above mentioned brands.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in Czech Republic is relatively advanced, our operators offering almost the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force classical operators to lower prices.
He may not be missing for a long time.
We have already mentioned on Mobil.cz that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The ČTU (Czech Telecommunications Office), which has reported that the price of a text message was higher in us than in the rest of the Union, has also confirmed it.
Thus, following the last steps of the European Commission in the area of roaming charges regulation, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - SMS sent from abroad will be for some customers of Czech mobile operators less expensive than in the country.
How can prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really like to enter the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, since we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that is far above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this regard, Pavel Dvořák, President of the Czech Telecommunications Agency Council (ČTU), has stated several times that there was no room for another operator in the Czech Republic, he is chorus with the operators.
It is probably true that a classic operator with his own network apparently has no more chance (at the moment, he would find only difficult frequencies).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that has led to a significant price drop, to which the traditional operators should then also react.
However, even before the entry of riots such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, voices similar to those heard at home today were heard in Britain.
However, it appeared that there was still room for such operators and that they could have real success.
We are not obliged to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch, in Poland, of the virtual Mobilking operator.
In just six months, this operator managed to win over 100 thousand customers and become the country's fifth operator.
Let's add that behind Mobilking, there is the Penta financial group, which has, among other things, the U:phone in Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility to focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to function effectively, they need much less customers than a classic operator.
They are, indeed, exempt from construction, operation and maintenance costs of the mobile network, relatively high.
Thus, in the world, virtual operators profile themselves as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often counterbalanced by a limited supply of services.
For example, in Britain Tesco Mobile offers text messages at least twice as expensive as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, placed on an unusual target group can also constitute a good blow to advertising.
Indeed, this operator is specifically aimed at men.
"The true men choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," said David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept could also be used in our home.
Miroslav Čepíký, Vodafone's spokesman, doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
As far as it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the offer of services."
In the Czech Republic, no chance, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but negotiations in the Czech Republic are not very encouraging.
Mobilking's launch will take place in other countries in our area," said Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the Penta financial group.
It thus indirectly confirmed that operators in the Czech Republic were, in any event, not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do their best to ensure that a potential competitor does not appear.
The GTS Novera group, which would thus take a new step to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of business customers, has not been hiding its intention of launching a virtual mobile operator for a long time.
"We tend to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunications services, but also mobile.
And the sooner it'll be the better.
We have already negotiated this possibility several times with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have succeeded in moving forward in the negotiations," said the spokesperson of the Pavel Kaidl Group.
So the future may be promising.
According to non-official information, we may be able to welcome the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
But for the moment, its creation is accompanied by total silence.
"At this point, we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is compared to other very specific markets.
For the time being, no subject provided for a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," said Vlastimil Sršeň of the Press Department of Telefonika O2, in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile Martina Kemrová's spokesperson states in a rare agreement with the statement of O2: "We have not recorded for the moment a viable and bilaterally beneficial project, which could serve as a basis."
And she adds: "It is practically excluded that a virtual operator appears in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
To operate in such a limited time, we should now have a concrete agreement."
Instead, Vodafone directs his attention to the completion of the requests to obtain his own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepíký said regarding this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
This is what we think means the most inputs from the customer's point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to establish a common network for a fast mobile Internet."
Responsible authorities: in phase with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of another operator meant an increase in competition, would have led to a lower price and thus to a lower profit.
What, then, would it be good to facilitate the development of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, operators know that they understand each other in the oven. The joke accompanying the creation of the U.S. is also a witness.
The biggest apparent pressure on ČTU, when the U:phone was created, was the one exercised by T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by information available to the public from the ČTU website.
Today, the U.S. phone is ready to use as an argument not to accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted in this regard: "Competitive competition in the mobile market has also recently been amplified by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
In view of the nature of the mobile market in RT, it is clear that the entry of an additional player would be subject, and especially its services, to high requirements."
But given the attitude of the mobile operators here, the indifference of the Czech regulatory bodies appears to be disconcerting.
However, this is not just the attitude of the ČTU, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
It belongs exclusively to the Agency for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
However, the latter adopted, in view of this problem, its typical position.
"The entry of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator concerned regarding the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been reached for the time being, as the offer of potential stakeholders has not given sufficient priority to classical operators," Kristián Chalupa, in response to our question from the Department of External Relations of the UOHS, said.
A statement thus made would not surprise the representatives of the operators.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, take care that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, such a statement is more than misleading.
Moreover, Kristian Chalupa adds: "In a foreign country, where virtual operators are usually present, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to a lower price of mobile telephone services."
However, pressure in the sense of an honest functioning of the market and a price drop is not apparently part of the interests of the UOHS.
What is actually shocking is the almost touching agreement of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question, if it really is a coincidence, is of course a question.
Similarly, a strictly identical fuel price for all service stations is likely to be due to the accident and the hard fight of competition.
"The Office has not noted, in this regard, signs of anti-competitive behaviour, so it has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position, therefore none has an increased corresponding responsibility for their behaviour on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market for virtual operators are probably missing even the telecommunications regulator," Chaloupa said.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many points of disagreement.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the ČTU, according to which telecommunications constitute, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators have a dominant position on such a market.
However, some law experts suggest a different view of things: in order for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, the consent of the network operator must be obtained at each time.
And the mobile operator logically has the monopoly on his network.
This is how he necessarily plays a dominant role in a particular segment of his activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for ÚOHS that three mobile operators are performing in a similar manner.
However, the complaints of many stakeholders (including GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Retrieval of responsibility on the ČTU is a fairly common turn in communications, by which the ÚOHS washes the hands of the case.
We have already encountered this kind of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recent renewal of the Telecommunications Act did not bring about an extension of the ČTU's powers in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised to improve the situation.
This is something that the representatives of the UOHS must know very well, but their interests are apparently elsewhere.
When no one looks, it can work
In other words, the operation of some sort of virtual pseudo operators, several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies publishing their own mobile phone service price list, but the latter are only partially public.
In most cases, it is a matter of companies dealing with multi-level marketing.
Personalized mobile phone services are offered, for example, by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms are generally only available to the electorate.
The magic tower consists of the fact that the company before the operator is a classic business client, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, it obtains special price offers (and other).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If what you are saying happened, it could be a violation of the contractual conditions that we would consider and which could result in a conclusion of collaboration with the company in question," replied Martina Kemrová to our question regarding this problem.
However, it is not likely that an echo of such activity will not be achieved until mobile operators are responsible.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, there are thousands of customers.
No operator shall, however, oppose such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms bring them non-negotiable benefits, and, at the same time, by opposition to genuine virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepíký points out the possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are used only by a percentage of negligible customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it as regular customers of mobile operators."
That is precisely what should appear strange in the ČTU.
In addition, another question was raised at the UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes on such a procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the UOHS has relatively broad powers to disclose such an activity, and if it does not wish to follow the operator's explanation, which claims that there is no idea what would happen, their contractual conditions prohibit it.
When we're no longer the most expensive country
As we have mentioned many times before, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a significant decline in the price of services.
However, in virtually all countries where virtual operators appeared, classical operators were increasingly, more or less, trying to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were almost the same - too small, or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
It is precisely at this level that, in developed countries, regulatory bodies were involved, which did not defend the interests of mobile operators, but those of their clients.
Both by formal measures and by informal pressure, they ended up obtaining the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are dealing with this issue in the way of a hot potato that is being decomposed by transmitting it to a close target.
As a result of the experiences we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that confusion in their skills is more than profitable in these cases.
But let's not throw the stain after the cognac.
If the queue information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear at our home, the Czech mobile market may be moving.
If one of the operators accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it would be difficult for the UOHS to remain indisposed to the rejection (to discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech Hymne has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of the Day of Czech Nationality, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new records of the national anthem Kde domov myj (Where is my country?).
The gym was re-registered by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, an interpretation with hearts and an instrumental version.
The Chant is provided by Kateřina Kněžinková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremaš and Jaroslav Krkek are the authors of the hymn arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bélohlávek considers Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had already entrusted to Český razhalas (Czech public radio), he chose to interpret solo versions of singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I tried to make sure that the two singers, as well as the choir, had a good speech, so that we could understand the words well, that they sing simultaneously," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov myj held for the first time in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the theatre of states) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse des savetiers), the original Czech play by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of František Škrup.
It has become popular and people have spontaneously adapted to it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couple naturally became an integral part of the national anthem.
It will remain one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" hymne sound
Public transport (MHD) in Prague will introduce the hole in their ticket system on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be included in the history of Pražský Dovravní podnik (the Prague Transport Agency) as the date on which the first passengers will enter the metro, trams and buses, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, the latter is accessible to nearly one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day or 90-day fee (this one will be valid from 1 January 2009) and both have it recorded on their chip card in the information points and offices of the Dovravní pondnik (the Transport Agency), located in the metro stations Muzeum, Mostek, Nádraži Holesovice, Andel, Roztyly, Latvian, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
From yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy online coupons on the web pages of the Dovravní podnik: www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred people enjoyed the service during the morning.
Those who will start using the online store can definitively forget the holes in the metro stations, where they had to wait for patience in long queues to get paper tickets.
In fact, they will purchase their coupon online and will be registered on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"In these contact points, there is a gate with trained staff available to passengers, who will help interested people with the purchase of the internet and will also record the coupon they bought on their card," said the spokesman of the Martin Opatrný project.
Alongside libraries, it will also be possible to record electronic coupons on Opencard in automatic distributors installed in the lobby of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, recalling the machines to compose tickets and the passengers may have already noticed them in the Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be twenty-four," said Opatrný.
An auto will control the coupon instead of the driver
The machines that will work from tomorrow are easy to use.
Just insert the Opencard chip card and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in the surrounding city.
It means in the periurban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which mainly use the inhabitants of the municipalities of central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In the integrated trains in Pražská integrovaná dovora (integrated transport in Prague), controllers are equipped with card readers, using which they establish the temporary and zone validity of the coupons," explained Filip Drápal of the Ropid organization, who designs the time of transport in common Prague.
Periurban buses are equipped with integrated card players in the driver's box.
It is therefore necessary not only to show the card to the driver in the case of the boat, but also to place the Opencard at the place indicated on the side of the box.
This is how the driver controls the validity of the recorded coupons.
"Where the passenger would need to verify the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing simpler than to ask the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not take the periurban buses and will not remember the date on which their coupon expires may re-enter the automatic distributors, initially used to record the coupons on the map.
Here, on the screen of the device, information about the validity of their document will be displayed.
The Sutes demanded a referendum in the United States
In 1945, the Germans of the Sudets demanded that Shumava be integrated into the United States.
This is the result of a letter filed in the collections of the Jihočeská vedecká knihová (The Scientific Library of the South Bohemia).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some German Sudettes groups allegedly addressed the President of the United States with such a desire.
This comes from, among other things, a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of Jihočeská vedecká knihovna.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in the letter the American president not to allow "shumavská župa" (forest region south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation well and we really want to be sure that the words declaring that American troops come into German territory not in oppressors and enemies, but in liberators," is written in the letter, signed "People, to whom the fate of the Shumava is at heart."
Since the accession to Czechoslovakia is not allegedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - only of brutality, indifferent attitude, incomprehensibility, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take into his hands the protection of the Shumava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a foreign state, which oppresses and destroys minorities and which has contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of the 4 million inhabitants," says the letter.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States doubted the opinion of the Germans of Shumava, he would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to determine whether its inhabitants wanted to be part of the United States, or to live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given the present knowledge of post-war history, appear somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it well illustrates the expectations of the Germans of the Sutes of the time.
While at least the Czech Germans had to question whether the question of their expulsion from the Republic would arise, very few of them had such an opportunity.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to obtain a certain type of autonomy for the Sutes.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms it.
During the war, he was, as a German of České Budějovice, engaged in the Navy in the Baltic States.
At the end of the war, he was captured by the English and placed in the capture camp in the Holstein region, dozens of Czech Germans came to see him to learn the Czech language.
"They believed that once they returned home, the Czech would benefit them," says Chalupa.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war believed that, following the Beneš Decrees, he would not be expelled from the Republic.
You don't think about it. You pay!
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
One way to characterize the emotional media campaign is to launch, on Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport.
Minister Aleš Rébíček's office believes that it will discourage drivers from a dangerous behaviour on the part of the pilot.
This 150 million-dollar campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the Internet, but also on tracts.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and driving alcohol.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
She especially wants to touch the conscience of young drivers, motorists, pedestrians, without forgetting the professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
It also testifies to the slogan "blooding" of the entire campaign:
You don't think about it. You pay!
The phrase "You don't think about it" is written in capital letters on the registration plate.
Then, in a blood bottle, there's the phrase "You pay."
Which must symbolize that one can pay for life a moment of carelessness.
The spots will "hand" the spectators until 2010.
The Department has inspired similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images can be seen in common with drastic images of the victims of accidents.
He believes that this will lead to a decrease in the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The Sugar and Fouching Strategy against Drivers
"What goes with the drivers is the sugar system and the faucet system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by winning time, when they grill a red fire.
Fuck, it's the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be recalled to the drivers," says Martin Kořán, the transport psychologist of the Na Homolce hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, says the psychologist.
The panels that indicate the danger to drivers are, according to him, already less effective.
"When a static panel that warns against a danger is installed, it will probably soon merge with the environment and let's not notice the driver," Kořán said.
Olmert would make the exchange of peace almost all the occupied territories
Ehud Olmert, the President of the Israeli Interim Government, spoke in favour of the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published on Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all (occupied) territories, or all," said Olmert daily.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the Israeli territory), because without it, peace will not be made," he added.
He admits that the possible return would include East Jerusalem.
"He who desires security in Jerusalem, and above all does not want tractors and bulldozers to break his feet, as this has happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert noted by alluding to the two attacks in the city in July, during which several people were killed and dozens of people injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historic places" located within the Old City.
"He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
That won't work," he said afterward.
Retirement of Golan's heights
Olmert also expressed his support for Israel's retirement from the Golan, which he believed was an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a retirement of the Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up in order to obtain the Golan.
They will have to renounce their current relations with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shiite movement); they will have to renounce the constant support they give to Hamas (the Shiite movement), Al-Qaida (the terrorist network), as well as that of Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq," said the Prime Minister.
Questions that arise after the accident: The stewards in the accident because they are illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance is forbidden
In the context of the tragic accident of the Student Agency bus company near Padoue, Italy, the question arises whether stewards and passengers can move within the bus during the journey.
"If the law was to be strictly and formally respected, the activity of a steward is contrary to the road traffic law," says Karel Hanzelka, the spokesperson of the Department of Transport.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostess was lost, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the bus path.
The young girl was at the moment unfortunately sitting next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two other seats at her disposal.
However, the car can have an accident, even abruptly braking, also when the driver serves the coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matters is whether the bus is based on its technical record with standing or not seats.
If this equipment for standing places is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
The long distance buses Student Agency do not have standing seats; this was confirmed at Aktuálně.cz by the director of Radim Jančura.
"It is a matter we have dealt with with the ministry and, at the beginning, it prohibits any movement of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we got that passengers can go to the toilets during the trip provided they have their own seat," he revealed his position.
The law ignores stewards
"There is no uniform legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal prescription is involved in this role.
On the other hand, there is no legal requirement for the carrier to offer services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term of vehicle receiver; it does not define its rights and duties," adds Hanzelka's spokesman more ambiguity.
Josef Pokorný, the director of the Department of Road Traffic, considers, on the contrary, that the law deals adequately with the problem.
"All depends on whether the bus has permission to offer standing seats in its approval.
It's all in there," he said.
Buses are divided into urban areas, where there are standing places and a limited maximum speed, interurban with higher standing places and a higher permissible speed and long standing coaches with the highest permissible maximum speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Horín, an expert at BESIP (road safety) in transport, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"In a regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of service in aircraft.
Moreover, it is not certain when a turbulence will occur and the hostess of the air can catch his head."
"But if the car had suddenly stopped, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
Same way as in a city bus or a tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of the drivers by internal requirements," he said, and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jancura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer stewards services.
He hires two hundred.
Even after this accident, the Director does not consider their profession to be a profession at risk.
"However, as soon as I have the impression that this is a risky profession, I will remove it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and their newspaper on board.
This would also reduce costs," he said.
The security concern is the reason why the director of Asiana Alexei Litvine, in comparison with SA, provides a very small number of lines in his vehicles.
"We don't have hosts.
Soon this will end with a fatal accident," he said, a year ago, at Týden.cz.
A Great Tragedy Has Come
A young host from the Plzeň region, who had been working for society for two years, died during the accident on the line of Naples.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop band without using a flashlight and blocked the road to the bus.
The driver of the driver tried to avoid it by a sudden maneuver, but he slammed it on his right side.
Janchura refuses that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards have been sold.
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these places, they are blocked."
The company plans to file a complaint against the truck driver.
For the compensation of the young girl's family, the agency will not wait for the judgment of the court, but with regard to financial compensation, it also relies on the defendant.
An amendment of the law?
No view
An amendment of the law, which has been being developed for more than one year by a group of thirty experts from the Department of Transport, could provide clarifications on the movement of drivers on board the bus.
"But it has not reached any conclusion on this point.
In fact, it is not too interested in the bus, but rather in the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the laptop to the steering wheel," says expert Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of stewards to be a fundamental threat to passenger safety," concludes Hanzelka's spokesman, stating that the control of the safety of the vehicles is under the authority of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfs are based on Frankfurt.
The main words were not lacking in the letter addressed by the WestLB Steering Committee to the household employees.
From a union of the entities of the Düsseldorf financial institution to the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt, "the central institution of the financial markets of the Sparkasse financial group" could be, according to the public e-mail made Monday.
The WestLB would provide a double-competence block of sustainable productivity in such a case.
To sum up, such a relationship could be the decisive signal to other concentrations in the Länder banking sector.
What does this look like when a steering committee intends to demonstrate its capacity for action in difficult times?
Because WestLB, wounded, is still under heavy pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, which has only recently made it clear to the Government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time was counted in the search for a future solution.
However, it has been a matter of some time already - also on the side of Frankfurt - of a relationship of some form between the Deka bank, which knew Sparkasse's customers through their investment funds, and WestLB.
The head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas reported in the presentation of the figures in the late August that he saw no sense in the merger of the Mainzer Landstrasse house with a Land bank, whether Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Deca Board of Directors, each half of which is supported by Länder's banks and savings fund groupings, has commissioned the Steering Committee to conduct talks with WestLB for joint commercial activities.
It could then be the flow of the financial market, or parts of it.
However, the talks are only beginning, it is said in the financial space.
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, which, with its 3000 employees, is one of the most important employers in Frankfurt's financial position, is at stake when it comes to consolidating the savings fund sector.
In 2003, it was believed that the Deta-Bank could merge with the Bank of the Land of Rhineland Palatinate and Halbab.
However, nothing has emerged from this field bouquet.
The plans had barely been made public that the government of Hesse had taken a stand against any participation of Hellaba in them.
Afterwards, the other two houses did not join.
The Bank of the Land of Rhenania Palatinatet was attached to the Bank of the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new approaches to the grouping of the Deca-Bank with Länder banks.
Finally, however, Günther Merl, chairman of the Hellaba Steering Committee, spoke against any commercial strategy of merger with his bank.
Regardless of this, the feeling appears to be widespread that the grouping of different public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the elections to the Bavarian Parliament have been held, a union of the BayernLB with the Bank of the Bade-Wuttenberg Land could be realized first.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure that forces new mergers is to increase, the potential partners will gradually escape it.
In the South, she would now be a junior partner, although she has so far been better able to withstand the crisis than the Munich and Stuttgart banks.
The Hesse-Thuringe Savings and Transfers Group, which owns 85 percent of Helaba's capital, has, on the other hand, pulled a lock at the beginning of the year on any union with WestLB.
The NordLB would remain strict.
However, such geo-strategic reflections reflect only one facet.
Another aspect raises the question of how the different commercial models of each of these banks can be arranged.
In June, Merl stated that the crucial issue, namely the commercial model for the future capacity of Länder banks, had not been resolved by the German group of savings and transfers.
In the end, a WestLb landing might take place, a landing that is obviously not desired here.
This is also the case in the letter of the Steering Committee in place: in any case, a 'global solution' for the establishment would be envisaged.
In what way will all of this be put in the same basket with the union of certain entities with the Deta-Bank still to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, for the first time, for Luca, for the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanied him as a little friend, and so nothing is the same, he said.
Behind them, almost a ton of five litres of beer from the Kaiser brand, there is a well built barbu that shows about 200 visitors to the beer festival which its deep taste can produce.
Elena taps Luca first, then kiss him.
From Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, from the road station near the Puorta nova station, four buses take off tonight at 2345 hours, 'destinazione Monaco, festa della brewra', arrived scheduled at 630 hours.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, in one of the buses traveling exclusively from Brazil.
In a parking lot, South Americans sing gold and already next to their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And also noisy, says Marco Guarda, it's not for Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long double coat of fake fur and glasses to large silver fittings.
For five years, they've been going to the beer party, already three times nothing but this year.
They go out at night, they stay the day at the party, and they come back at 22:30.
Spending the night there would involve unnecessary expenses, Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, broken in accordance with the Bavarian purity law, sickness insurance and a responsible German-speaking group - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
And the buses are already running in the night on the Autostrada direction `Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything gets calm in the bus, the travelers sleep.
That's better, they'll still need their strength.
Breaks will be made in Bressanone, and Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian registration plates will take a while before Munich, on Highway 8.
When the Marco group finally arrives at six o'clock in the morning as planned on the parking lot near Thérèse, almost 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco has a final speech, explains the plan of attack.
First of all, take a cup of the little yellow casket.
It is written on the left 'Beer Party', in Gothic, and next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency `conocerssivaggiando.it'.
Second: 'When the doors of the chapter of the beer open, we're short', Marco yells in the morning.
'Run!' Run and reserve the places at the bottom of the tent.
'Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow tapes on the same banks, we have to distribute them in the room!'
The chop, cries Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the delivery!
Show the security officers that we're doing well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!'
Third: 'To come back here tonight is ten and a half hours!' Understand?
And that's it, it's gone to the beer party.
On the road, some nine of the yellow shells on the trees to find the way, the panels and even an election poster from a large Bavarian popular party.
We tend to be ready for the return.
This is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the 'weekend of Italians'.
There are no precise figures; there are 50,000 people who travel through the Alps and sink into the beer kiosk, 10 percent of visitors would have come out of Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are strengthened by seven South Tyrol policemen, by Italian volunteers who support the Bavarian Red Cross, who produce statistics on countries where Italians occupy the first place in front of British (60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by Italians is the tent of the Hofbräu brewery.
Insomnia Nights for Hypo Real Estate shareholders
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance insisted only a few weeks ago.
What a chance the politician used the word “relatively” and that he slipped that the German banking sector would not be spared by the crisis movements.
This one actually happened this weekend.
The financing of the Bavarian real estate Hypo Real Estate (HRE), next to the DAX, receives a billion credit from a consortium of German banks to protect themselves from market turbulence.
One person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters on Monday that the aid appropriations were issued up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hippo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
The money comes from both private banks and public law banks.
In the background, it's Depfa's daughter company that supports the losses.
The state finance was, according to a newspaper article, refinanced in the very short term for long-term projects for which it had borrowed money - which is no longer possible since the lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95 per cent to 2.37 million euros, and the equity rate had also been slightly reduced from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
Current and net profits from financial transactions were, compared to the same period, the previous year, falling to zero, the profits from the allocation of fixed loans and securities as well as the settlement of provisions in credit operations had fallen by more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
And it is only through the significant profits from the reimbursement of lower accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the repayment of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for the companies in Group that the gain deficit of around 16 percent has been moderated.
After privatization in 1990, the former state finance had at first misinspected industrial real estate credits, which had then been affiliated to the Aareal bank.
Because of the low cost of conventional state funding, Depfa had subsequently become more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects between private investors and the State (Privacy-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the subsidiary, the Hypo Real Estate must carry out amortizations that should have an essential material effect on the group's profits and losses, which is still quite dim.
The fact is that dividends have been amputated.
By 2007, they had already been jailed by two thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate is, since the purchase of the Depfa, a very important state investor and infrastructure.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on refinancing on the inter-bank market as it has no client deposits.
With the failure of the Lehman Brothers Investment Bank two weeks ago, the allocation of loans between banks has again increased considerably, banks having accumulated their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs a short-term means of refinancing for a portion of all Depfa's credits every year -- about EUR 50 billion.
According to a communication from the Hypo Real Estate, the group's need for funding is covered by medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of the international financial markets far beyond its current state of play.
Other sources say that refinancing would be secured through the funds by the end of 2009.
The chairman of the HRE Georg Funke Steering Committee explained, on the other hand, that the Hypo Real Estate group should no longer use medium-term financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Establishment for the Supervision of Financial Services (Bafin) are based on the principle that the capacity of the Hypo Real Group on the Market is now assured.
The bank's shareholders and creditors have no more than to wait for it.
However, given the dynamics and the importance of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not unthinkable, however, that funding should not be used as a whole.
But the opposite can no longer be avoided.
After the bank is, according to the latest reports, still at the doors of insolvency Sunday evening, this rescue for the least temporary will not be able to reassure the minds anymore.
The course of action fell from 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
The course of obligations, on the other hand, is particularly good.
While debt to the first head has barely moved, second-level loan rates are slowing down.
The most affected are the investment funds of the former Württemberg Hypo subsidiary and those of course who have a lifetime beyond 2009.
The obligations of the Hypo Real Estate Bank had previously seemed to be an alternative speculative investment, and their value should now be considered as dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net toughening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself that led to the crisis in the institution by the purchase of the Depfa Bank.
As long as the emission institutes, governments and less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it can be assumed that the withdrawals can take place over time.
Or what nobody can expect at this point - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of renewed noises of partial nationalization, the probability of approaching security today has become a simple founded hope.
This should include nights of insomnia first and foremost for long-term creditors on the decision to separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can always use what they have drawn on to provide a deferral of losses for the coming years on the income tax of the capital of the automatically collected stock exchange gains.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box in Bento
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, has to present herself for the first day at the Tachibana High School, the girls start to laugh: the German is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knew this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Exchange Log, she speaks of Japan.
"The first day of course in Japan.
What was I excited about?
Already on my way to school, I was scared.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and take the train for 40 minutes to the Tachibana High School.
I have to find the way alone, fortunately I didn't lose.
The beginning of the courses does not seem to be as strict as ours in Basse-Saxe.
The students show up after eight hours, until nine hours less than twenty, a table tour begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the course started, it was for me to introduce myself.
I am not at all like to speak in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I had not yet the school uniform, I put on an old mother's underwear, as well as a shirt, blue shoes and black leather shoes.
So in this manner, I introduced myself to the pulpit, and I tried to say everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class made all the low classes, laughing and making signs, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him through my sleeves.
It belongs to the vocabulary essential to the survival of the Japanese age and means "mygnon, chou".
Then I quickly slipped to my place.
The girl next to me made me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor for the corresponding woman to sit next to her.
The rest of the time was quite calm, but when the gang resounded, I was assaulted in the rules.
Everyone was talking better, laughing and asking me a lot of questions - in this case, it's hard enough to understand Japanese.
During the break, they all left their Bento.
My foster mother had also made me this kind of lunch box - that's really different from the poor Germans.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, small sauces, a combre salad and algae, fruits and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I'm eating right here in Japan.
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste.
What's certain is that everything's really good.
All right, except maybe the fresh confectionery salads, bro!
The Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and is then prepared especially carefully - in the hope of getting a little better knowledge of the boy during the break.
I read it in my mangaes.
I'm curious to know if I could observe it here, too.
"Why Japan especially?" asked my friends when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
I've always said:
"Maybe I'm fascinated by it, what"
After all, reading mangas, that's what I've preferred for years.
And in order to better understand the mangaes and culture that is there, at one point, I also began to learn Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a low for traditions, customs and customs.
And here, we give them a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is severe, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have feelings
A rat or a coward ran into danger, does that mean he also feels afraid?
The neurophysician Joseph LeDoux is convinced of this: many animals also have sensations.
But how can we check that he proves the same when he behaves the same way we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to have proof of it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else who has so far been able to prove it all the way we cannot prove that other human beings have a conscience.
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the issues of feeling or in general of consciousness, we will enter hard-to-practice fields because hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it kills, flees or attacks.
Human beings behave in the same way, so some scientists deduce it from a comparable subjective life.
However, I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make the transposition of our subjective life to that of difficult animals.
One aspect is that the circuits associated with the human consciousness almost always include the prefrontal Side Court (due to its participation in the short-term memory and in the management and enforcement functions).
This vast region is much more developed in human beings than in other primates and seems to be completely absent in other beings.
Therefore, for these aspects of our conscience, which depend on the Court of First Instance, including the conscience of whom we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being differs even from the other primates.
Another significant particularity could reside in the linguistic nature of man: a large part of his existence is related to language, which often means that his conscience depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even though the conscience should not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that the animal conscience, whatever its way it is produced, would probably be much different from most of our state of conscience.
That is why it is so difficult to determine what the consciousness of other animals can look like.
If this, internal and subjective, is neither measured nor, because of this particular Hardware, analysed on the basis of our own experience, then its observation poses serious problems.
Most of my developments refer to the contents of conscious life, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more readily accessible scientifically.
Animal consciousness processes could be considered without taking into account their content, and that is exactly what happened during short-term memory studies of primates, particularly with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nervous correlations of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Curiously, this approach also underlines the weight of the Court's prefrontal in the realization of visualization.
But what's the result for the emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as fear is activated in a conscious brain of its own activity.
What we refer to as "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its suites, such as the reactions of the body) takes away from the living memory.
Thus observed, emotions are closely linked to the cortex regions that characterize the primates and especially the Man.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our evolutionary nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to blame them to others than ourselves.
On the contrary, Antonio Damasio thinks, for example, that feelings from primitive activities are born in the regions of cortex and brain stem cortex, as well as Jaak Pankseep, which nevertheless concentrates more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could be fully involved in transversal feelings in all kinds.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I think it is indemnible.
Pankseep argues that what appears as fear in men and in rats is likely to be as sensitive as that in both cases: how can we check whether rats and men feel the same when they behave similarly?
A coward ran into danger, but if he feels afraid?
In my view, similar behaviours are not enough to prove identical vecus.
Of course, the nervous comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, whereas the cafards do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem the source of the sensations?
And even if we could prove this for Man: how could we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cafards (who knows?) have feelings.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably completely different from ours (since the human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
In all cases, progress is being made to the extent that the same is being achieved in rats and in humans.
Since I don't explore language and consciousness in rats, nor the sensations, I don't know if they exist.
We could think of this as short-term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly squeezing against a wall.
I'm actually a pragmatic emotional.
Platinum, President of the EUFA: a deadline for thanks for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government considers the UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise, in collaboration with Poland, the European Championships," Wasjunik announced.
"But it's not amnesty for our country.
The work is just beginning, and there is still much to be done in both countries."
In the timetable for the construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts run after time.
The number of stages for the European Championship could possibly be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work at maximum speed," said the President of the Ukrainian League Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA has constantly been watching us."
An even more radical measure was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, an independent administrator.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that PZPN will not be able to act in the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish PAP Press Agency.
"We made sure in a letter to the UEFA President that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer."
Several members of the First Division League have already been convicted of manipulating compulsory relegation in the previous season; ultimately, the League's beginning has even been reported at the last minute.
Dennis Quaid angry counter-attack
She wanted to make the promotion for a new film, talked about her private life in an interview - and now she's bored with her ex: the Hollywood star Meg Ryan raised the veil on her ex-adult Dennis Quaid.
It emanates - and counterattacks.
A Late Rose War for the former Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid couple: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are delivering themselves to a humiliating battle - both in view and in the south of the world.
Last week, Meg Ryan expressed himself in an interview for the American InStyle newspaper about the causes of marriage failure: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
She would have been aware of the extent of the fraud only after the divorce.
The reason for this stripping of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - there is a story of an adult.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to her husband's qualification as an infidel fell clearly: it would be "Monstrious," he said to the "New York Daily News", 54 years old, that "Meg repeats once again the history of our relationship and manipulates it."
It would be more "suffering", that "the punishment and disturbances that cause a divorce for each child should be re-opened in public" for their 16-year-old son Jack."
While Ryan has lived alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
So his answer was: "In any case, my life continues.
I'm happy to have a wonderful family that's going for the best."
Flight tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, hotel flights and nights were less expensive than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel nights would be beneficial - this is the result of a study by the American Express Financial Services and Travel Provider.
The company analysed its booking data in the first half of 2008 and, following an increase in prices in the first quarter, established a net decrease in profits in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, hotel nights have already been reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities examined further by 6.9% on average compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was mainly in Paris and Rome, where travellers were paid from 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this would be for American Express in the low dollar course that led to "the desire for low-income travel of American tourists".
Financial places such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices are up 26.3 percent, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was rising in the first quarter:
As the price of kerosene increased, economic-class passengers paid on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-mail flights, very fuel-consumers, even increased to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, economic-class ticket prices dropped by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, in business-class and in first-class, however, price variations were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen 11.9 per cent, in the second quarter, by 23.6 per cent.
German domestic flights were even divided by two according to this study.
The reasons for this fall in prices would be on the one hand slowing economic growth, the firm explains.
The request would yield land in many segments of the travel market by plane.
On the other hand, there would be an increased pressure on competition from the "Open Heaven" Treaty, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe.
The sign of the trend is the abolition by airlines of non-profit routes, as well as the high number of airlines that would have deposited the balance sheet during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies only in Europe.
HSV bat Gladbach 1:1
With a simple purpose and methods, the Hamburg SV becomes the first of the ranking.
In Borusia, Luhukay has still not been able to find a functional eleven.
From Kristoff Klein. Agrindir. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player will only come late into the game and his shot failed against the target frame.
His message was precisely formulated, he was out of his lips persuasively.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," Siffla Hermann Rieger said in the corridor of the Hamburg arena.
There wasn't much going on in the clothes, half the time was over, and most of them took their place.
Rieger has been the physiotherapist of HSV for nearly three decades, enjoying a great reputation as well as former protagonists.
And that is why his request was received at strategic locations.
Assistant Coach Cornelius Jol has acquired and lifted the thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of the chief coach of Hamburg Martin Jol.
Do the orders seem to have been similar: and let it skip with this second purpose!
There was a lack of practice.
"Everything wasn't very nice to see today," Marcel Jansen later said.
Bastian Reinhard would have been "also more relaxed".
This 1:0 (1:0 in mid-time), the Hamburg team owes it to a hit of the head successful by Mladen Petric (at the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak Gladbach players could not harm the weak Hamburg players.
"It was a bad victory," said Marin Jol.
The Hamburg SV will celebrate on Monday its 121th anniversary.
Already on Saturday afternoon, the supporters celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional ranking tables on the giant screen that indicated their club as the first of the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We can take back," said Marcel Jansen.
It is doubtful that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictable nature of the first League than the domination of its HSV.
The team with its late arrivals - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen debauched from the FC Bayern - is slowly forming, but it does not shine yet.
"We need more charm and more dribbles," Jol demanded.
After the vote failed
On Wall Street, the fear goes around.
The first news of the rescue plan's failure has temporarily dropped Dow Jones by 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day of all history.
Later, the Dow Jones got a little caught up.
About 20h30, the world's most important stock exchange index cost 10,579 points with a very high drop of five percent.
The Nasdaq technology exchange index was 1548 points with a decrease of more than seven points.
The most losers of the Dow Jones were at that time American Express who lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could be reported any more of the benefits.
Bank Goldman Sachs' shares charged a decrease of almost ten percent.
Just a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffet joined the company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds must be mobilised to buy what is called spent mortgage papers.
However, the amount must not be paid once but gradually.
On the other hand, the State should recover options on the actions of the financial company that may be exchanged in relation to the course evolution in order to reduce the burden on the Public Treasury.
Courses of action in Europe and the United States
The billions of aid to banks in Europe and the United States did not address investors' concerns.
The course of action of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax to the bottom.
The U.S. Dow Jones index collapses despite the rescue of the state's financial market.
Spectacular decreases in Hypo Real Estate and Commercial Bank courses led to a serious deficit in Germany (Dax).
The stock of Bavarian real estate has now lost three-quarters of its value in spite of the federal government's rescue operation and private banks, the Commerzbank has charged with a decrease of more than 20 per cent.
The Dax clearly slipped below the important psychological bar of 6,000 points and costed 5,839 points with a 3.7% deficit.
In the world, the markets for shares have fallen to the knees.
In New York, Wall Street was working with significant losses.
The investors feared that the US Government's $700 billion heavy rescue plan could not be enough to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10,809,25 points lost in the first opening hour 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The House of Representatives of the United States intended to vote on the rescue plan, and the vote in the Senate should follow on 1 October.
The other European scholarships also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index charged a decrease of 3.2 per cent at the time, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 per cent.
In Asia, the main Japanese index Nikkei fell to 11.743.61 points after an increase of 1.26 percent.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index dropped from 2.1 percent to 18.286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 per cent and closed at 12.595.75 points.
In the MDAX, Arcandor's shares fell after the announcement of an increase in capital.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed 23 million new shares.
The multinational trade and tourism company has further indicated that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter affects flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers in perplexity: dark matter affects the speed of space probes while called gravitational support maneuvers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying into space.
Because of fuel pipelines soon to freeze, death is a cryogenic threat.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused dissertation among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a process of space probes, by which they obtain additional light in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example the Earth.
So probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical skill, as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
This is what researchers have been amazed at for years: flying objects do not always behave 100 percent of the way they are expected under the venerable laws of gravity.
Moreover, irregularities appear at the speed level.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the attraction force of the matter because of the space curve, might not be entirely correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study always believes that Einstein was not mistaken and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support by what is called the black matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also near the Earth," he writes.
Space researchers have only known the existence of black matter for about ten years.
There appears to be an attractive force whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
It, on the other hand, is completely invisible, i.e. it neither sends nor reflects any electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light.
According to scientists, black matter would still be a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their rapists, the kidnapped tourists in Egypt should be released, as did the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs.
The Sudanese shipowners had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the firefight before the release, six hostages would have been killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were kidnapped.
Negotiations for the ransom would already be undertaken.
The Germans are constantly in the kidnappers' collimator.
WELT ONLINE represents the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are clearly free.
This is what the Egyptian state television, the Arab Al-Arabia Arab television channel and the Italian media have communicated in concert.
The Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the Italian Sky TG 24 television channel bulletins: "Our citizens and other hostages have been released.
We're checking their health status," Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanians and their eight Egyptian companions are doing well and are safe, the Egyptian national television announced.
The 19 participants in the tour in the desert should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a firefight before the hostages were released are still vague: as such, the kidnappers would have been close to putting an end to the kidnapping, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army kills six kidnappers without shouting a stop.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," the agent said.
There was no more than to collect hostages," when suddenly, "this surprise" occurred.
Sudanese soldiers had slaughtered six of the rowers this Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and had arrested two of them.
The hostages had demanded from Germany a ransom of six million euros; the money had to be paid by the German woman from one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" stated that, according to a German mediator, the release of hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, rowers wanted to free women's hostages after the ransom payment.
The men had to be detained until the rowers found a safe way to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this story.
Abuse of a father-in-law "who leads to suicide"
A court was informed that years of abuse by her grandfather led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, in the Cornwalls, was imprisoned for six years after admitting eight heads of charge for indecencies.
Truro's court-martial reported that he regularly read his beautiful daughter, Stéphanie Randle, during her childhood, from 5 to 7 years of age.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court was informed that Melle Randle, 34 years of age, committed suicide in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
When she was living in Coventry, Trerise had tied her up and strapped her before forcing her to commit sexual acts, while her mother was working in the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to life in the Cornwalls.
His beautiful daughter went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Melle Randle, a volunteer national trust assistant, was subjected to abuses that had been inflicted twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told Melle Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, that since 2006 he seemed "emotionally dead", and had "lost all hope of life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
We think she killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted the beautiful father of his daughter who had also written a letter of confession that ended up saying, "I regularly attach and bind her."
"I didn't abuse her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You are really weird as a fetishist, your victim must certainly be terrorized, especially at the age of 7.
"This dissident saga ended with the victim's suicide.
And what's even more surprising is that if she hadn't done this, her story would certainly never have ended in court."
He added: "I particularly stress, as his father and mother describe him, the effects of your crime on Stephanie for years.
"Without these, she would certainly be today a happy, promising, and successful young woman."
Condemnation for loss of official data.
The Office Cabinet's ministerial officer who had forgotten top secret documents, in June on a train, will be sentenced by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC said.
The man of the Ministry of Defence was on his way when he forgot two highly classified documents, on a waterloo train.
The documents were passed into the hands of the BBC before they were delivered to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said that this episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
"They will have thought that this case would remain between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Office of the Cabinet," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed shall be charged with a violation of section 8.1 of the Act, that is, the clause dealing with the storage of information.
.The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the departmental officer be placed under the care of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Associate Committee on Secret Services.
The lost documents contained appreciation of Al-Qaeda as well as of the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision, Monday morning and was then transported from home to a secret place.
Building companies facing the B&B invoice.
British construction companies might have to pay a bill of more than £80 million to cover the rescue of Bradford & Bingley.
The Government has provided £14 billion to protect deposits of 2.6 million savings from Bradford & Bingleys.
The interest of this loan will be paid by all companies that collect savings money, including 59 companies in the building.
The Director General of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles, said that it is "irritant" to know that companies and their members will have to pay the broken pots...
The £14 billion loan will be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's mortgages are cleared.
But the interests that are going to increase at the same time will be owed every year to 700 financial companies that harvest deposits .
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC that the 59 companies in the building are included in this list.
It is disturbing to see that institutions that have had prudent behaviour... now have to pay some of the bills of the institutions that were much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is announced that each company must pay a sum proportional to the deposit it holds, and that intermediate companies must pay about 18 per cent of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest of the loan will rise to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to settle the interests of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Commercial Committee of Building Societies, told the BBC that this decision seemed unfair to him.
It is "irritant" to see that institutions that have had prudent behaviour in the resumption of the real estate market must now pay much less prudent institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first years.
"We need to examine all aspects of this case over the next few weeks, to assess the options to be adopted to prevent the building companies and their members from paying this sales invoice," said Mr. Cole.
Interests for 2009 cover seven months, from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010, the interests of the entire year will have to be paid, which could also double.
Since building companies are non-participating organizations, their members end up paying the bill either by higher charges or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases up to five pounds per litre
Jersey people have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy announced that she was going to raise the price in bulk of her milk, from five penny to a litre, from Monday.
This is the second increase in the price resulting from an increase in two Pennys in February, and is the result of a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers must decide whether they go to their turn, increase the price to consumers.
Before the increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey's milk had changed for the last time in 2002.
An ex-Pm from Bangladesh has been denied bail
A court in Bangladesh rejected a claim for bail from the former PM Sheikh Hasina, which is likely to be arrested on his return to the country.
Her lawyers said that the court refused to grant her bail on account of her being sued for extortioning a man, 50 million Taka ($729,000.00) when she was PM.
This case is one of the many charges against him.
Khaleda Zia, the always rival of Sheikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina should be back in Bangladesh for a few weeks, but her party, the Awani League, demanded that the country's provisional military government give her full freedom first.
Correspondents pointed out that the terms of his release were contradictory because if he was allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, he could not see why he could not remain free to return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers announced that she would now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court's order.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request saying that she does not require bail since she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We shall bring an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court"
His lawyers argued that she needed this assurance to return to the country in order to prepare the elections in December
Sheikh Hasina should come back after October 17th, a former leader of the Awami party said.
She was detained last year after the military interim government took over power, but was released in June to care for abroad.
Sheikh Hasina as Zhaleda Zia, no charges they make.
Concerns about the Afghan anti-polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, almost 200,000 children have missed the recent polio immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, the United Nations said.
Last week, the United Nations launched a vaccination campaign in the six provinces.
But she said she was unable to contact children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located in the south.
A United Nations spokesperson stated that despite the pledges of the Taliban not to attack or obstruct the thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses ITV Judicial Battle
BSkyB lost its trial following the verdict of the Competition Commission, which would force it to reduce its participation in its rival ITV transmitter.
The Court of Appeal ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission stated that, in the past, MSkyB's participation had prevented competition and allowed it to unfairly influence ITV.
BSkyB purchased its shares in 2006 following an agreement to prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Office reported that the purchase by BSkyB of ITV parties had raised doubts about the effective independence of ITV, thus encouraging the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin's boss Richard Branson, a group of consumers, and Ofcom's regulator were all contrary to this purchase.
BSkyB reiterated that the pressure to reduce its ITV parts would not be reasonable and that it was, on the contrary, excessive – especially since BSkyB has just renounced its voting rights.
New investigation into the case of U.S. prosecutors.
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to check the issue of the release of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
All of this came from the case report of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, which criticized the actions of certain ministerial officers.
The report was critical of officers of the White House, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political causes.
The Special Prosecutor, Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation have lied to the investigators, thus obstructing justice.
" Serious allegations of potentially unfounded criminal conduct have not been fully confirmed or resolved," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special prosecutor capable of forcing witnesses to testify was one of his greatest recommendations.
The dispute began with the radiation in December 2006 of nine American prosecutors formulated by the Department of Justice of the United States.
At the time, the department had stated that prosecutors had been licensed because of poor performance.
But then it emerged that the licensed prosecutors were not more critical than their other colleagues, which led some observers to attribute political connotation to these licensees.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to the Republicans of Congress, while others would have refused to investigate allegations of fraudulent voting against the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and pursuing judicial proceedings for the government.
It is certain that they can be licensed at any time, but they cannot be for political reasons.
The Chief of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, has been accused of being involved in this licensing case, and finally he resigns.
A number of departmental officials from the Department of Justice also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales's role in this case, stating that he considered him "first responsible" for these dismissals, and ended by "dedicating" his role as leader," which was remarkablely successful not being involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including Bush's former collaborator, Karl Rove, were critical of their failure to cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's team will have to be honored.
The Rock Star Meat Loaf, must be honored at the Q Awards for its epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London next week, declared to be "honored" to obtain this recognition.
The nine-minute and fifty-second song was the hit of the 1977 Meat Loaf album.
This year's Coldplay is presented with a limited selection of four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are songs that transcend things such as time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is definitely a party
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice like that of Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was marketed in the United Kingdom, as a single one in 1979, in the 15th place.
In addition, its Bat Out of Hell album remained in English rankings for nine years, and it was sold to more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, whose real name has been suffering from health problems in recent years, has even undergone an operation to cure her heart beat irregularly, after falling on stage in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Then he was found a cyst in the vocal cords.
A Sombre Street in the City, often forgotten, and maybe Etre Soon in Sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous ones, others only functional.
. And even some veteran taxis as well as long-term local residents do not know how to go to Extra Place because they have never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and is heading north of First Street- not to be confused with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide for 120 long, it looks like a dusty wing rather than an active artery.
. No panels indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the manufacturer of recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to restore Extra Place, and create a smoother transition to shops and shops, which should open in new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-term neighbors, have said to be charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets of the house pasta.
But the Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development of the city that manages the street has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of the neighbourhood owners' committees, representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay issued a proposal authorising the real estate manufacturer to buy the street.
But the committee prefers that the street remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of the Committee 3.
"There are only a few spaces left in the city, and we would like the city to preserve Extra Place," she said.
"They could propose to reinstate and manage it, what Avalon could do, but we wish to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to rebuild the small street and install seats there, some would also be used by a coffee to which the manufacturer would grant space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, the spokesperson for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to exploit the street, it does not necessarily mean that it wants to be the owner.
"The main interest of Avalon Bay is to relook for this abandoned goose, and make it public," she said, stressing that it was the city to suggest the sale."
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for the Preservation of Real Estate, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street, also stressing that the agency's mission was to develop property rather than manage it.
Compared to his more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical impression.
Some believe that Extra Place has been named since 1802, when the legacy of the large farm of Philip Minthhorne's many children was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has been abandoned.
The later entry of the CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, opened in Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photo covering Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia"
"This place was beautiful," said Danny Fields, Ramones' manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of ferrets, halls, bars, posters, sheets and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about the evolution towards the luxury of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble small property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a true rarety - a virtually identical fragment to the city that should be fixed in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (titled "The Book of Contests: A Nostalgic Look at a City in the Extinction Process") tells the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small ass-bag tight, dark day as night, and bounded by the doors of a rusted iron warehouse and Persians, full of newspapers last week that fly along the gouts."
With few exceptions, the street is always the same.
A short rat at the bottom of the street, close to a door that led straight to the CBGB, and which has now become the seat of a store of chic clothing.
Graffiti on the walls, a bottle of beer of 22 ounces empty, lies next to newspapers that are just thrown away.
A few passersby said they thought only rarely at Extra Place, and suggested its development.
Mr. Field, on his side, said that some of the people under him felt that the street was attractive in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "have taken place in dark, wet and disgusting places."
The Bilingual debate: Immersion in English
In this part of the Education Supervision Program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates regarding bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, former member of studies in California, and former director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "not as good as you didn't think. Why do middle classes have to be able to choose their school."
Attracting the favor of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are an interesting example.
Mr. Obama's campaign stresses that "African and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students."
To combat these differences, Mr. Obama's education programme supports, in particular, so many other topics, "transitional bilingual education" for those who learn English.
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to achieve a bilingual education that defends teaching in other languages than English goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in the east of the county of Los Angeles.
The students of this school are largely Hispanic, and low income.
More than one third of students, consisting of many new arrivals, study English.
Among CM1 students, 100% passed the 2008 Maths State Review, an expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students have passed the examination of English-language arts
This incredible success was achieved through another ingredient than that of Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street on analysis, practice, constant capacity assessment and exemplary attitude.
In addition, and here is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, head of Sixth Street, this school has introduced the instruction of the English language "full immersion".
The total English-language immersion focuses on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Melle Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, told me "we had a great success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you went without his class, you would have had no chance of identifying him."
"That goes, does she notice, "it went for us"
Mr. Obama should not take the example of the Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools composed mostly of Hispanic students learning English.
The excellent results obtained by this school speak of themselves; but the policies on education within his party (the Associations for National Education have long supported bilingual education) and his enormous support for bilingual education, obscures Mr. Obama's response.
Although it is favourable for immigrants to learn English, Mr. Obama recently considered this issue insignificant, when he declared that we must all stop arguing about the English language law.
"On the contrary, he will declare, "you must make sure your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should carefully consider the educational models that work, rather than detach them or consider them as insignificant.
Coutte Nete du Oil following the New Concerns of the World of the Economy
Oil prices have dropped significantly on Monday, as people are afraid that the rescue plan for financial markets will not be able to restore life to the economy.
The crude oil operations fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel. The New York Market Exchange, during sales this morning.
Prices have dropped more than $20 per barrel since Monday.
In the last two weeks, raw materials markets have been undermined by Wall Street's financial upheaval, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After learning about an increase of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 per barrel this month, before rebounding to the view of the deep uncertainties of financial markets.
On Monday, investors are again concerned despite the rescue agreement, the biggest of history, concluded this weekend by the leaders of Congress.
The new was mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis would be sustainable.
In the last episode of this financial disaster," Citygroup will buy the bank operations of the Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have nationalised the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Barclays Capital analysts have stated that this weekend's frenetic negotiations, concluded with the rescue agreement, seem to have failed to revitalize the market."
While the economic situation is deteriorating, demand for raw materials, including oil, should slow down.
"The prospect of global equity, interest rates and exchange of markets has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors."
"we believe that the raw materials will not escape this contagion.
"As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand to what extent the American virus would spread globally and particularly in China."
Bank analysts have reduced their expectations for the coming year, given the fall in oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, so they were forced to reduce oil and gas prices by 20 per cent for 2009.
The Feast of the Second Determinant Time for the Improvement of the Team Record.
After spending the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in the Shaun Ellis Jets uniform, the defender thought he had seen everything.
He looked at the second time, when the Jets turned a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like this," Ellis said.
The second time began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals played saltily under dark clouds.
Then the Brett Favre quarterback managed to make a pass to Laveranus Coles allowing a 12-yard touchdown, signaling a precursor of a afternoon during which their relationship made a bond ahead.
Favre found Coles for two other touchdowns, the first when a back corner fell and the second, at 10 seconds of half-time.
"I'm not out of my area" Favre said about all his passes to Cole.
"It's a mediocre player"
"We communicate extremely well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Cole were playing in the trap, the defense fought the Cardinals' quarterback, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, cornerer back, intercepted a lost shot and made 32 yards to the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the balloon escape because of Warner.
In the last change, the loss of Bowens' ball, could well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this property in the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the balloon, Jay Feelly scored 20 yards taking advantage of 34 to 0.
It was best that the Jets were able to mark in time.
"The Jets coach, Eric Mangini, to whom we were asked to describe this madness, said "the second or the third time?"
When the two Jets were told that they had left 21 points undisputed in the third time- Mangini said: "I can tell you that I appreciated the second time more than the third.
"Many points have been marked in a short time."
Gebrselasia rested, beyond its world record.
Hail Gebrselasia, Ethiopian, once again proved worthy of her title as the best background runner of the century, after beating her own record of the world at the Berlin marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory at 2:03:59 from a comfortable race on the course, Gebrselasia beat his record at 2:04:26 last year in Berlin.
At 35 years of age, Gebrselasia won the 26th world record of his wonderful career during which he won the world championship or the world record at any distance from the marathon of 1600 metres.
Last month, Gebrselasia had missed Beijing's Olympic marathon, fearing - it may be exaggerated in today's eyes - that air pollution does not increase its asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promises to run to Berlin.
Under almost perfect weather- sunny conditions, 48 degrees at baseline, 55 at arrival- Gebrselasia won Sunday, now an impressive average of one thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
The track runners such as Gebrselasia and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted to background runners, have contributed to the decline in the marathon record for more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin at 2:06:05 .
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters, suffered shocks at the mall two weeks before, and missed training for a week.
Clearly, the rest allowed him to stay bright, but not rusty.
"I am so happy," he told reporters.
"All was perfect.
I gave myself up last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end, everything went for the best."
He was particularly accused of Kenya, the rival of Ethiopia, of having too much orchestrating his race, avoiding the world stars of the marathon, counting in fact on the rabbits as if they were in a track competition, and considering the world's memories more than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the size of Gebrselasia's capabilities as a background runner.
Sunday Gebrselasia, preceding four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. on my way.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselasia after the row heads disappeared.
A little over three miles from arrival, Gebrselassie made her final climb to depart from Kwambai, which ends second at 2:05:36, improving her best personal record in five minutes.
Kamathis arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year with the seventh time of 2:19:19.
English Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone who won London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She could not participate in Beijing's games because of a low back mortgage, but promised to win Berlin, improving her third marathon, her personal record for almost five minutes.
It runs using a skilled strategy, allowing the group of Ethiopian runners and Kenyans to take a great advantage, then exceeding them about 18 thousand 1⁄2 after.
Askale Tafa Margasa from Ethiopia arrived second at 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenya, ended third at 2:25:01.
In a City in Part, the Orgueil and the Trials of the Black Life
Hidden in the development of its huge park, a few miles from the sun, the brilliant and giant Orlando, there is a small quiet town where the pride and complications of African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first wholly black city to integrate, the children's house of Zora Neale Hurston, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to make our days." The town is five lakes, three shorts of croquet, 300 dark skin, 300 good swimmers, full of goyaves, two schools and no prison."
It has now become a pilgrimage city
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival, which is held every year in Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
And in various ways, the city she describes became tourist thanks to its inclusion in Florida's tourist guide edited by The Depression era Federal Writers' Project- remains a separate place.
She is also independent, worthy, and private that she was not already in the 1930s, when Hurston told her that Florida's rural black population was often reluctant to share her true thoughts with the white man, who "we know so little, doesn't know what he's missing".
Although it is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has also called for an open dialogue on the subject of race, many here remain cautious about the view of foreigners.
"We are very careful about how to tell the story" said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, who has always lived and the oldest parishioner in the city.
"It must be in line with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical model of a black power take and a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
This is a central point, but also an example of a South-South black rural culture - sometimes desecrated, at other times acclimatized - that recalls the birth of American slavery.
What would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville was born with Zora, which everybody here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the whole world through sincere books, full of dialects, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed this city, located just on the exit of Route 17, a road that crosses the centre of Florida, often forgotten, which ends in the chapter of black history and human drama.
Audacious as a big box in life as in literature, Hurston led readers to the property store of the first Mayor of Eatonville, Mr. Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parts.
"passed the road on the left," she writes, "you will find the modern public school brown and white, with its gardens and these well preserved playgrounds whose Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he barely knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned the new widow Dash husband and wrote that Lee Glenn" sells drinks of all kinds as well as anything that can be used to passersby.
So, in almost a hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with a self-government but also with illiteracy, remarrying, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn't like that.
It wasn't really a portrait everyone liked.
Zora described the reality well," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson's young daughters who Hurston immortalized, quoting colorless songs, interpreted by men who rented their beauty."
She added: "Some people didn't appreciate it."
We always remember Hurston as a living and eccentric person, who often returned after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston used to come to town without warning, on board a large Chevrolet, a cigarette to his mouth and wearing pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional costumes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed at her.
"the people were always happy to see Zora," he said.
But he adds, swinging in his backyard chair that gives on Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was definitely baptized, that "she never stayed too long".
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was already a literature star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in a grave somewhere in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no big commemoration, no record for the big public.
I don't think they understood the contribution or heritage she offered to the world," said Valérie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography by Hurston published in 2003.
A crucial moment comes in the 1980s.
Public officials in Orange County wanted to make a five-way highway in the city to replace Boulevard Kennedy, the main two-way street in the community.
Orlando's development has already pushed Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made while Eatonville was just returning from a difficult period of his history.
Forced integration, among other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the dispute over the mix of races led to hatred at the doors of the community.
"At that time, a band of white youths came to launch oranges or objects against the people sitting on the side," said Mr. Franklin.
"a lady is even dead."
They launched a patch of their car" .
In a 1955 letter addressed to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's application for forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education" rather than the glorification of my race."
Residents now declare that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some respects, has diluted Eatonville's cohesion and weakened the confidence of young people.
"The black children had the habit of kissing - I remember well - we kissed our master in the morning, and also in the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, as well as the head of the Eatonville Community Guard, a non-profit group.
It lasted, added, until teachers and students no longer come from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because he's white - I mean there's a cultural demarcation line here," Melle Nathiri said.
Civil rights, moreover, have created space for many other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond the harm, such as she, armed with joyful self-confidence and lines of conduct such as: "How can they get rid of the pleasure of my company?"
That's beyond me."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker went to Hurston's anonymous grave and began to fight to revitalize her reputation.
Five years later, a biography on Hurston produced by Robert E. Hemenway, a real best sealer, reintroduced it into American cannons.
The highway project came just when Eatonville's most famous girl had found her attraction.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors consider it a rescue.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of this highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the inauguration of the festival two years later, and many come back in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the county rejected the proposal of the highway.
"The five-way highway failure, extremely fast, is a real civic pride," said Melle. Nathiri.
Melle Boyd summed up the whole statement that "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been classified as a historic city since 1998.
A single theme library (of course well-known Hurston) will open in 2006, on a beautiful Kennedy Boulevard, refurbished.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time be seen as a rear street during a summer rain day, as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90% black today)
Foreigners who come to discover Eatonville's story, its reason for being, are still being treated with caution.
It is necessary to ask permission for most interviews, and some things – like the walls of the old church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields – should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Melle Jones, a courageous teacher and who has a weak for the bright red, are still afraid that their island community is not well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride is emerging.
In particular, young people tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston considered its entire race: beautiful, problematic and everything, neither better nor worse, but also proud, creative, bossy, crazy and mixed than other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is true of the sincere civic affection that Mr. Franklin's nephew's voice, Edwin Harvey, 18 years old, intends to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or police forces, who need additional forces.
And even for the younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have correctly learned the description Eatonville.
"Most of the people who pass through this area will think, "Oh, this city didn't compare to other people."Alondra Kenon said after last Sunday's Mass.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate history, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, everyone talks frequently about finance.
Even so, nothing has changed.
If the tourists in Manhattan were away from the kiosk and giant television screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they were in the eye of the cyclone.
They could never think that in the glass and bees' offices above their head, the bankers and cover fund managers who monopolies New York spend the worst "day at the office" since the 1929 crack.
The suppliers continue to wander on the sidewalks, with their carts and muffin plates for morning meetings.
The Latinos always pull between residential buildings carrying, like the dead, fifty luxurious shirts hung on a jug on their shoulders.
Office employees continue to make queues to buy their morning sandwiches to the travelling merchants, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 16 and 7 p.m. a.m.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic stories until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Luckily I was planning to work late at noon, because I was discovering my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, 20 people making the queue.
Not in front of the cassier holes, not to remove the species or make a payment, but in front of the customer service gate, where the usual customers ordered their Queques, the tourists asked for direction for the Macy store, and the new customers would open accounts.
Most of those before me, I would later learn from Starr, my "authorised personal banker", all made the line for the same reason as I did.
Not the same, because they had already removed their savings from smaller banks, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They removed their money from the savings accounts called trifts (including a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings funds and their subsidiaries that only function in a state, and who said to treat customers like their families.
In a recent period, 15 of these banks failed.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a $327 capital bank used the bankruptcy syndicate, and while the New Yorkers would come home for the weekend end this Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, saved a $440 million value, desperately looking for a buyer to save her.
The office and the shop employees who are in front of me, excavated by another potential debauchery, have transferred their money to a bank that seems reliable to them, the one that does the most rescue to Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
"I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on Lehman Brothers' phone, the bank that failed, and her late Director General Dick Full, with the same familiarity she might have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lynn, the concierge in uniform of my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my fruit and vegetable merchant.
She told me, following my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings in the money market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take any chances."
Pronounced Muslim graves while Austria is turning to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who left the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the right Belgian Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization of the "city against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday 17 January 2008.
They carry road panels illustrating red-haired mosquitoes.
The Police accuse extreme right extremists of profaning an Austrian Muslim cemetery, on the weekend of the victory of the extreme political parties Right to the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at Traun cemetery, near Linz, between Friday night and this morning; it is according to the police, an organized action.
The criminals painted on several graves, Jewish symbols such as the Star of David; however, the detectives believe that this could have been done to dispel the hatred of extremists towards Muslim immigrants.
This accident could be in some way in connection with the elections.
A spokesman for the Islamic local community has declared to be "deeply shocked" in the announcement of this defamation, which occurs just during the religious month of Ramadan that touches its end.
Austria is seriously thinking about finding its courage, following its oscillation to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties that raised almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, carried out an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered, according to critics, as xenophobes.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 per cent of the votes, led his campaign against the port of crowds and burkas, and even expressed opposition to the food alaha.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European brotherhood" to avoid the climb of Islam.
The two parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and mines, declaring that they would be a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The surveys and analyses carried out just after the elections have defined the extreme right as the country's strongest political bloc, as demonstrated by the majority of young voters who have made the difference, because they are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter forbids travel abroad.
The courts prohibited the rock star glamour, Gary Glitter, accused of sexual abuse of children, expatriation in France and Spain.
The judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after expressing their intention to go to Spain through France.
The police in Kent had granted this prohibition to travel last Thursday after proving Glitter's guilt for sexual abuse of children to the magistrates.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at Ashford's limited court hearing, but was still represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesperson declared " Thursday 25 September at the court of Ashford, the Kent police asked for an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling in France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd wasn't there then."
Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, left to be registered on the list of sexual abuse charges.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police, 7 days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he may punish up to five years' imprisonment.
Kent Police stated that it would not discuss special cases or potential movements of Glitter in the county.
A spokesperson for Kent Police said "Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect our children as foreigners.
"In our view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the United Kingdom because we have devices that can manage any potential risks, much more effectively.
"protecting Kent's inhabitants is the most expensive intention to the Kent Police, and we closely monitor the behavior of those who are charged with sexual abuse in the region, in order to minimize the potential risks to the public."
. Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month, after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of two girls, respectively, aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane to Bangkok from where he would have to board for a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well, and he refused to leave for London.
The Thai authorities blocked him from control of the passports, and eventually he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused to enter their territory, so they were forced to leave Bangkok; the Thai police and immigration officers insisted that they return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport on 22 a.m. and remained there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to Uxbridge, West London, for registration in the list of persons charged with sexual abuse, as requested by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been sentenced to four months in the United Kingdom for detention of child abuse images.
A source from the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was reassured and happy to know that Glitter had been banned from moving to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master outside the scene to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
Neither heels nor outer garments.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, released from all tensions to obtain the relaxed aspect of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in these moments unknown to the general public, where you discover intimate gestures and stolen views of artists who don't care to go on stage.
German Günther Bauer combines the theatre with singers, dancers and guitarists with the less famous artists in "Flamenco - people".
In this project, the photographer resumes the special iconography of the flamenco under different angles.
Even in the programming of the Flemish Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, larger each day", explains the creator, who explains that "Flemenco - people" "may be any one but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage the passion, sadness, joy ... encapsulating the public.
To capture moments of the personality of these artists you don't have to take pictures on stage.
They have a personality and a clean character.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera the instant personality of the stars of the flamenco."
With the "Popular Chant des Mines" festival, Bauer started a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of the camera and the equipment, restores the classic photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of the flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day."
It is not the dance or the song itself, but the personality and character of the artist who takes the audience with his art.
The search for the essence and magic has been the constant work that we are presenting here at the El Fotómata gallery.
The flamenco views such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about sixty artists photographed.
The project has become a flamenco anthology, which will soon be published in a collection book of portraits exposed to the gallery.
Bauer's passion for portraits made him repeat the idea two years ago with the "Old Sports Portraits" ("SportARTProject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves photography of people's portraits, to know them and to be able to enter their lives for a moment longer or less.
I think in photography the portrait is the most difficult kind.
You're facing people, people you sometimes don't know or leave just a few minutes to take a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flamenco - people", is exhibited at the El Fotómata Gallery, located on the 20th Street of the Mata (a parallel street to the People of Hercules) which will be opened until the next 16th of October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "true bold"
The novel takes place in places that no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to move forward the new project he is working on, a novel that has for the main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who has lived in the Congo for twenty years and who has been through the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize Prize for Literature has confirmed yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia, that the novel that currently occupies it is "a real boldness" and that it "all shows that it should not be written".
"If I were reasonable, I wouldn't do it, but I'm going to do it, and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his speech at the Festival of Exchange of Ideas and Thoughts that for four days he saw a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people in the city of Aqueduct.
The author of "The City and Dogs" was the most expected character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award with the majority of the participants, made a full room at Juan Bravo Theatre.
The presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, met with an fascinated audience who did not see the past time during which Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and a great amount of humor, drew the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst for reading" and "to live new experiences"; how he wrote in a "very methodological way" through an intense work of documentation, by correcting and rewriting a part of the text to deal with his "lack of inspiration"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspired his novels.
Hispano-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know whether books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "make people less similar", because the writers were asked "not to let themselves go to freedom" and to assume their vocation.
Bad weather hits the Pozoblanco fair
The flag festival that concluded the bull races at the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after the horse bullies had verified that the arena was impracticable.
In this way, the organisation committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather came on this fair, as finally two parties in three couldn't take place.
Saturday was the rain that prevented the second scheduled bull race.
In the poster, there was José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who should have faced in the arena of Castilblanco
So only Friday's Feast took place
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and was brought in triumph, after making movements of arms against the bull with taste and aesthetic.
The very afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banners planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the undiscovered gradients applauded more than his own struggle with the bull.
Even worse for El Jules, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without any pain or glory.
When his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he sneered at most of the public.

Police officers arrest two occupants of a van and the latter take the escape.
Its load, more than two tons of hachisch, is what to stop them.
Policemen pursued them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A.A. J., according to the information released by the Department of Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual was accused of drug trafficking and falsification of documents.
The incident occurred when different officials of the Alava Traffic Unit carried out vehicle controls on the N-1 at the border of the Municipality of Arminón.
They were prepared to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed the orders, abruptly accelerated and the control began.
The policemen began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometers below the bottom, where the two occupants went down to escape into a forested area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they carried and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hachisch balloons, and then they moved to a police station for a thorough inspection and to weigh the drug.
In addition, the officials found that the registration plate had been "false" since it did not coincide with that written on the grey card of the van, that is why they also accused the prisoner of a falsification offence.
Ertzaintza continues his investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old detainee, A.A. J., has been alerted to take action and will be judged within the following hours.
Activist Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of a drug
The actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the Melrose Place TV series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara, California, for driving under the influence of a drug.
A witness saw him make strange maneuvers trying to get out of his garage in Montecito, after a spokesperson for the California police patrol revealed to the People magazine.
The witness stated that at 4:30 p.m., Locklear "really leaned on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and walking back and forth several times, she rolled on her sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who at first did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and left his vehicle.
This person, at that time, called emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life".
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She had the disoriented air," that's why the agents took her to the drug and alcohol center to do a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress has been cooperative and alcohol abuse has been eliminated from the beginning, although "according to the observation of police officers at first sight, we believe Locklear was under the influence of a drug".
Locklear was arrested for being suspected of driving under the influence of a substance that was not specified and was imprisoned at 7 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left Arizona's clinic where she was hospitalized to deal with a nervous depression.
Callazares asked the Andalusian Federation of the Union Gauche to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The coordinator general and Member of the Union Gauche, Gaspar Llamazares, today stated that it is the regional federation to take a decision on the case of the former counsellor of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after having been accused of performing favourary treatments to members of his family.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said as to the conduct of the political party he will have to adopt within the Municipal Council of Seville.
However, the leader of the Union Gauche has requested that investigations prove "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The Union Gauche has always defended this kind of business so that they have a maximum degree of transparency".
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all officials".
"Mayo's blood," Garci's ossuary.
In inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós's stories, José Luis Garci reclaims the famous battle of the Spaniards against the French in "Mayo Blood", which is the most ambitious film of his film with nearly 15 million euros in budget.
The filmmaker tried "to show the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The film of more than two and a half hours," Blood de Mayo" will be released in the cinema halls next Friday, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid for more than four hours.
A great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci assures us that with this tour he has realized "a dream of a child" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him, three years ago, to make a memorial film for the two hundred years of May 2, which he always accepted when the story held to national historical facts.
The 15 million euros provided by the Community of Madrid constitute a "unique opportunity" for Garci to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothing the atmosphere of a "Spain that has deceived itself into fighting, as the struggle for independence has led the people to rebellions under the rule of Ferdinand VII", he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having obtained funding like for the films "Captaine Alatriste" or "The ghosts of Goya" - more than twice that obtained for "Mayo Blood" - because he was unable to turn a few scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with which he collaborated almost all his career.
The filmmaker of "Wolver has started" influenced his usual way of working, on the stage of the actors, with whom he has the habit of repeating before he starts the tour and to whom he does not make a casting, as it seems to him to be "humiliating" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theater and to the cinema to keep himself informed".
Many actors in "Mayo Blood" repeat in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larranñaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Four times in Oscar (he won one), Garci considers that the three candidate films representing Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, "Mayo Blood", "Seven tables of French billiards" and finally the winner, "The blind turnsols", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "who would deserve to be better known," he said.
Garci doesn't expect a price with this movie.
"At first you think you're working for the poster, and then you realize you're working only for prosperity, and now you're happy to make an extra movie," Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón puts herself in the skin of the Sevillan dancer Tortola Valencia
A Sevillan dancer will also pay tribute to a Sevillan dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florence Tórtola Ferrer) and a Andalusian mother (Georgena Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Triana and will live in London with her family at the age of three.
He was a free and specialist dancer of Oriental dances.
She was a passionate pioneer of the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and pleaded for the abolition of the corset which prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman, who marked the history of the dance in Europe of the two wars, fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the latter proposed to interpret the Sevillan dancer Tortola Valencia and that seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
The titles of his dances made me think of the flamenco.
So "the dance of the butterfly" made me think of a popular Cuban dance and "the dance of the snake" at some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was the same as hers," she says.
The stage was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: the one by Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabela again in one of his performances, as he had done at "The Open Door"; and the one by Professor Matilde Coral, who was exceptionally well prepared to work with the one who was his student.
"Matilde transforms Tortola into a mature character.
I am happy because she has accepted to play a role in my work and it honors me."
The stage was also performed thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were considered divine".
This work also relates, in a certain way, the life of this woman who has been displayed in such distant places, especially at the time, as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she was usually resident in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think it is these women who have a huge influence in their time and now no one knows and appreciates her work," says Bayón.
The show will start at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre
The publication of the "Newly Married Poet's Journal" concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Newly Married Poet Journal" in the Church of Saint Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize for Literature and their death.
In this way, the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-editation of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the travelling exhibition " Juan Ramón Jiménez: This People of Light" which was inaugurated last May and which, after traveling to different Andalusian provinces, will go to New York at the International Congress.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia purchased eight hundred copies of the "Newly Married Poet's Journal", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most famous Andalusian poets.
America please less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was part of it."
This phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "No Malice", and well illustrates the despair of American cinema, and of all America, in view of the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He had the pain to get an Oscar
He hasn't been turning since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
This has been a tough blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what a person feels is beyond expression, and now I have lost a great friend," Robert Redford would cry, "my life and my country were better because of his existence."
No one was afraid to be ridiculous or exaggerated.
One of the fathers of cinema and country died during a particularly dark period, where terrorists and bourgeois markets are afraid, the American estimate has fallen very low, desperately looking for reasons of dignity.
When the times are so hard and there is no reason to live, there is nothing left to human beings but admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He incarnated an ideal of beauty and truth for everyone.
He was Richard Nixon's enemy and the defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of his deceased elder following an overdose and the creation of his own bio-food brand.
It was a victory for a country that had a penalty for committing suicide against a food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration struck Hollywood without paying attention to the nationality and passports.
The last James Bond, English Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, Oscar Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the top of his career.
The bad boy came from Australia, Russell Crowe, who used to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He put us in the top bar," said George Clooney, who may be the only one today who tries to capture the screen as Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious private life and away from the goals.
It is still not easy or possible in the media jungle of our day.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married for 50 years to Joanne Woodward, whom he was loyal even though he did not miss opportunities to be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house if I have a steak in my fridge?" he used to have fun.
In heaven, he is proud to meet his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he has interpreted, he has never been as proud as that of a devoted husband, a loving father, a caring grandfather and a philanthropist," he says.
Madrid in the race for the 2016 Olympics
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize Olympics, after the failure in 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we take the example of the race yesterday: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I've ever had.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would be the subject of a deleterious note.
But let's take a closer look at it from the beginning.
Errors begin with the withdrawal of the dossards, which forces you to move forward.
It's not bad, but if they move you, it would be better for them to give you everything (including the electronic chip for the races).
Well, not.
They made you go there only to take the trigger (first error, move only for this) and (after a long queue) surprised!, there was only the size of the trigger (second error, because I need an XL size)
In what world do we live?
Is it because of the crisis that they have decided to buy that small-size mufflers with less fabric and less expensive hit?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that you have to go there very early to remove the electronic chip, the waiting line is 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave your bag behind at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible since 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long waiting line, the competitions began and we had not yet left our bag behind at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait for more than 40 minutes during which riots and beatings of the barracks took place.
I believe that about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me will not even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the bullet they gave me that, I think, did not correctly mark the departure.
Of course, if they asked me to cite an example of a perfect race, it would not come to my mind.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 J.O.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the conference on Microsoft's Emerging MIT Technologies was presented a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a species of artificial intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move to the company campus) in response to what he was asked to do during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, who are - including remembering which positions they occupy - and listen and hear the key words of their conversations.
But also group them by conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person, but she understands that she does not belong to the group who is talking to her and is not part of the company.
She asks if she's here to visit someone and she tells her she'll answer in a few minutes.
All this without the blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course this is the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example, the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we discussed in addition to a change in Microsoft strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will no longer have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers were sold with the essential instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This is a discovery as Microsoft, after version, has not ceased adding functions and "extras" to Windows.
The change of strategy is welcome.
As a result, Microsoft loses its operating system of importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that Google Chrome is the first step on the part of Google to compete in Windows.
Several people have rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary as this is the essential basis for understanding software and software.
It works the same as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your grandmother.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but it is necessary to see the "death" of the operating system not as absolute truth but as relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People are less and less paying attention to the operating system but increasingly to the Internet browser.
We only light the computer to turn Firefox, Explorer or Chrome, and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than going through windows.
Who uses half of the applications provided with the system?
Who can do the least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain less applications, much less Vista.
Less heavy, covered months, less complex.
For the time being, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services to finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I will show you an example.
The photo presented in this article was taken early this month in one of the rest rooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the drink distributor, a display asks them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not leave at the beginning of 2009 but by the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to start Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
After all, the phone looks more and more like a computer.
But the Android launch is late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso urged him on the Côte d ' Azur, Leonardo di Caprio carrying one in Edward Zwick ' s Blood Diamond, as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola ' s Parrain and is part of the holding of the Muscle Gay Association.
And if we were to list all its apparitions, we could also mention this Mustachu cost that raised weights in a walking circus.
It's not just a simple masculine cotton body blade, milling and without sleeves.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel de Bruxelles stands out among all the others.
First of all, by his flaming name - although known as ' Marcel ' - which has to do with sport since he is named, according to legend, by the boxer ' Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
Marcel is distinguished by his excellent cotton, his unisex cut, his distinctive logo, and the small Belgian flag ( hardly recognizable) that the most well-known body blades have in the neck.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand only produces top tanks.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini-shorts...
Clothing designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even if it's harmful to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to be a young mother; the candidate doesn't bother me"
His huge similarity to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take their new activity very seriously in the fashion.
According to Monica, they are not just beautiful and famous girls who give their name.
It was present at the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new social headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important prices of the fashion that the Spanish house sponsors.
Monica is hot and shy.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have created for Mango for the new autumn season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and the dinner of the Opera in the honour of Valentino.
A very intense day but, at the same time, exciting, awaits us.
On what basis is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The film of the 1950s and 1960s charms us and inspires us much for our collections.
I like to wander around town and watch women dress up, how they combine their clothes, I often do.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very polyvalent woman, aren't you?
I believe that yes, but at the end of the day everything goes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was very young, I liked the clothes; I would like to go to my grandmother's house to look in my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the attraction park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of my dress.
The dancers like to dress very well for the courses and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when you wear clothes, that's when you really put yourself in the character's skin.
All of a sudden, everything's connected.
You haven't been there for 30 years, has it been hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever. My 30s are happy.
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoys life with less problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done all the things I wanted to do since I was little and it has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So you think you're becoming a mother?
Of course, I want to be a mother because my body asks me and, moreover, I want to be a young mother; I don't want to lose this.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I am not worried.
What I'm gonna do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movies, you wait for the different movies you made last year to come out.
That's right, I'm afraid they're coming out.
I, who am a woman from the theatre, am very impatient and anxious, I would like to have everything now, but of course it is not possible.
I look forward to the film 'The Last Hour' and 'In search of the tomb of Christ'.
Let's see what you're thinking.
A few days ago, you started on the pass with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't look at that!
I'm not up on the passageway to make the mannequin.
Simply, Naomi Campbell has called me, I have known her for some time, to invite me to participate in a charity show in London for her association in support of women and the clothes we showed - I showed two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were sold to auctions to collect money for Naomi's NGO.
The people that Naomi is a person of tender affection.
They say so many things about her, I know her, many things are not true.
Plus, that good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to show for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to make a bet, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the third world.
Alcohol repellents will need to install the 'alcohol' system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative sanctions for alcoholism to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the vehicle from starting in hibernation, or if he does not breathe.
The initiative has already been announced last June and is now appearing in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a pilot project that will last a year.
Its aim is to reintegrate the driver by offering him road re-education courses.
The Minister of State for Road Safety but also the Directorate-General for Road Safety and the Institute of Technology for Road Safety will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers arrested for driving more than once in hives, the car resumes.
The alcohol would avoid this because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol rate in thehale and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not breathe first; or when the driver’s alcohol rate is higher than the permitted.
Its cost is more than EUR 1,000 and is in charge of the driver.
In this respect, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced to 65% of the offences during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save life to 115 people every year.
This measure is based on administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, as legal reform can be done by ordinary means, but criminal reform requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have an experimental capacity.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Members will vote on an initiative by the Spanish Socialist Party which proposes to install this system in school buses as it was done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 5:40 p.m., the scheduled official time, the Spanish Air Force aircraft in which the Princes of Asturias traveled landed in the Presidential Hangar of the Benito Juárez Airport of Mexico DF.
The sun was awake to sleep, but its rays were still forced to lay their hands in the visceral guise so that they could see the royal couple coming down from the plane.
At the foot of the staircase, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier, I had asked the taxi driver in the street if he was aware that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to finish their official trip.
- Oh, well, we can't just go to the airport to pick up customers at this time... are you from here or then...?
- No, sir, I'm Spanish, but I lived here thinking for two years.
- Oh, okay...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the journey.
They are several waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military range of 27 Marine soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in marine blue, the Princess, when she has the hair in the wind, is dressed very much and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told him that an orage was threatening.
They make a brief stop with the photographers before passing into the room where the official court is waiting for them.
At the door of the hotel where they live, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a regolo journalist of Mexican television awaits them.
The most prestigious price of fashion
There must be no more suitable place in the world to present a fashion price than Paris and there must be no designer living more extraordinary and good living than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to strengthen the international image of the new fashion talents.
The winner will be rewarded with a price of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, watched her models in Mango's window at 54 Haussmann Boulevard in Paris, and she almost wept.
Certainly it is the second largest brand in Europe that has just been opened with 1,335 square metres of surface.
The first store is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank Stylist Valentino, president of the competition board, made us find ourselves in a luxurious dinner at Opera Garnier in Paris.
As a table next to the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango, seemed even more spectacular.
Having grown up on the heart and making a good heart against bad luck, because of his brother's recent death, Nati put on a mango dress and some ELAH pairs, which cut the breath, and arms on top, arms down with his son Luis - a beautiful man almost two feet high – she accompanied Valentino to her dinner prepared in her honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, as well as the Baron of Rotchil ended the night without a vestion because they had lent it to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who presented herself to the store with a pants and shirt – from her own collection – and who for dinner metamorphized herself by wearing a sexy and black long dress, moved when during the night visit of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the room of the ballet repetitions and recalling the good old time, she caught one of the bars and she made the gesture of a big fold.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the palace's dependencies, but she showed us first on her mobile phone photos of her son.
The next morning, we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another beautiful man moving on his bike – and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his draps, his maids and having asked in advance, that there was no smell in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, there, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to crown everything, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to the librarians on September 30.
The early morning wakes us almost when it sounds at 7:00 a.m., but it's even worse when we think of the rhythm of agitation that puts our present life on.
The office is synonymous with tension and the back pain computer.
Stress represents the evil of the 21st century.
But there are neither one nor two methods to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
But 1001, not one more or one less.
In addition to yoga positions, classical massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott meets in the pages of a book an entire 'menu' of methods adapted to the taste and time of each.
The anti-stress work is entitled ' 1001 ways of relaxing ' and will be at the libraries directly by editor Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to obtain peace in places such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' deduces such belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural income that help you relax.
If adrenaline doesn't cut into your veins to restore your body's balance and if stress has become a problem, it's time to sit in the couch, disconnect from your mind and focus on reading.
Speaking in Sleep
Some kids talk during the night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very awake by telling us something that happened the day before, but to the children who talk during their sleep.
The first time this happens, you may be surprised, but it really doesn't matter.
It is a blessed change in sleep called sleeploquie.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Of course there's more than one who talks during the night.
This phenomenon may appear very sporadicly ( once in life, for example, associated with a severe fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child remembers nothing more.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance
They are often linked to other sleep alterations such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (pipi to bed) or somnabulism, but this is not always the case.
As we have already said, they can also be associated with very strong fevers, stress situations, or overexcitedness.
Anyway, it's a little bit of a study.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
He may speak with a quiet little voice, with isolated words, whispers or otherwise with screams, tears, long speeches ...
If sleepiness becomes very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist to check if there is a problem that causes much anxiety and to obtain an explanation for the problem.
We have said that it is a beneficial change, that is why there is no treatment, unless it is related to another alteration of sleep that can be treated (for example, if it is related to a sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to bed.
Therefore, find quiet games and avoid TV programs or series that are more or less violent.
With children who are very nervous and who have difficulty relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down internally.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as sleepyloquies appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember no more than what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he's talking, he's asleep and he's resting.
Remember that if you are very anxious several times, it is recommended to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in your child.
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), do not have the temptation to question him for information.
You won't get anything, because you're asleep, he's not aware to be able to organize his mind.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, at once pay attention to the way in which you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can question him during the night to know his secrets.
Not even fun.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illustrating... finally
Illhaeusern finally found the way of victory on his land after a long period of neglect.
Without making a big match, the Young and Blacks have created the greatest number of opportunities and have managed to transform one for the win of the game.
The rhythm was not very supported during this meeting where the attackers had had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by the visiting captain Kauffmann, who was playing the lucarnage on a long shot, Illhaeuesern was going to take the elevator and tour Fonderflick away, then with Hirn on top, Romain at the end of the foot or Diebold came to the defense of Denmark.
In front, we were blocked in the middle of the ground and just left Riahi in the middle of the attack.
The beginning of the second half-time would be decisive with first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporal for Denmark, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illustians by Marais, well positioned to resume a ball based on a first attempt by Diebold (53rd).
But the Illousian Butter won't be able to taste his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the clothing a dozen minutes later and leave his teammates in digital inferiority.
But Denmark will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose serious problems to an Illhusian Onze who has just slowed down a bit to "compact" his defense, except in the last few seconds of the game where, after a big sweep, the ball passed very close to the crossroads.
Sarkozy at the Meeting of Angry Fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a tour of Britain.
In view of the demonstration of the strength of fishermen who had seriously disrupted the access of several British and Norwegian ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Guilvinec on Tuesday morning in Finistère to meet their representatives.
The latter promised to welcome it "in a constructive spirit" and hoped that it would "come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general meeting of the "crisis committee" set up by British fishermen to obtain measures against the flow of gas oil prices, which reached a record of more than EUR 1.14 per litre per litre.
According to Elysée David Martinon's spokesperson, the president will "debate with them solutions that can be imagined to help their businesses to regain competitiveness and to secure conditions of employment and remuneration for seafarers".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to stand firm by fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out shell operations in Morbihan and Calvados, which took place about 10 km away.
The port of pleasure of Quiberon was also blocked, but the links to Belle Island have not been stopped.
A filtering dam was launched on the almost island of Quiberon.
The mariners have already demonstrated their determination on Monday by burning tires and pallets from the dawn before the fuel deposits of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement has spread to other ports of the Atlantic and Manche facade, such as the Sables of Olonne, Vendée, where the hives remain, or the Havre, where twenty vessels have blocked the movements of commercial ships.
The fishermen from La Turballe and the Croisic, in Loire Atlantic, stopped in the evening the block of the important Donges Total refinery.
Those in Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the Wednesday meeting in the Department to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday on the follow-up to the movement and its participation in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by national fisheries committee officials, who did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will not throw anything" and "do not want to move to Paris," announced Liliane Cariou, for example, the chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on the pipeline, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but they consider that the cost-effectiveness threshold of a ship is only reached with less than EUR 0,30 per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died of cancer at the age of 83 in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes hailed the cinema legend and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts in 2008
The Brazilian aircraft table on 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that are planned for the world economy.
The fourth global aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 delivery devices, said Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft was delivered by 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, particularly for its aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider giving more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which the U.S. monetary authorities have rescinded, plans to give over 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that had been advanced to it, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is prepared to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and its retired activity in the United States, states the newspaper, which cites sources close to the file.
The Board of Directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to discuss possible transfers, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to separate include its International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% participation in the Transatlantic Holdings reinsurance and its real estate portfolio and its private equity investments, the FT adds.
No final decision has been taken on these transfers, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly implement liquidity to repay the loan of 85 billion granted to it by the Federal Reserve at the risk of U.S. authorities taking 80% of its capital, reducing the current shareholders accordingly.
Analysis Paris Meeting History Morning Meeting History Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic fall on Monday following the rejection by the House of Representatives of the Paulson bank rescue plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen near the 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) sank from 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the strongest fall in his story (684.81 points) had been previously recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of the post-terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, at the dominant technology level, delivered 1.983.73 points to 1,983.73 points and the Standard & Poor's 500 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street collapsed after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the Bank's rescue plan that was supposed to restore some stability in the markets.
By 228 votes to 205, the representatives refused the Secretary to the Treasury Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market was counting on this," she added, fearing that a project adopted within several days would not "be too late".
"If the project is actually moribond (...) then the relay will be passed quickly to the Fed (the U.S. central bank, ndlr) and to other central banks to manage the crisis, which would strengthen the credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, a leading economist at Global Insight.
And with more emphasis on the sense of urgency, "every day that passes brings the fall of a financial institution" to the United States, Mrs. Piegza stressed.
Following the failure of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has rapidly accelerated, prompting emergency interventions for banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, signaling that markets are facing "not only an American crisis, but a global crisis", the FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has grown strongly.
The 10-year-old Treasury return dropped to 3,632%, compared to 3,827% on Friday night, and to 4,161% on Friday evening, compared to 4,357% on the watch.
Obama, winner at the points of the first television dul
In the first Friday debate between the two candidates at the White House, another one happened to know who took it, from John McCain or Barack Obama.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic Campaign QGs proclaimed their own victory in this television duo that would have been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honorable, was not "bright enough" to enable him to see his downfall in the five-week polls of the presidents.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion survey was published on Saturday, awarded a five-point advance in Obama (49% versus 44% in McCain), believes that it was the Democrat who pulled his back from the game.
In the indecisive voters, who count, Obama won 39% of the polls, while 25% of them won McCain, according to a CBS survey.
Obama should be able to confirm its progress on Thursday with the expected good performance of his collister, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She has good instincts," however, Bill Clinton predicted this weekend.
Sept. McCain has never stopped putting forward his undisputed foreign policy experience, while stressing his opponent's "naiveness" on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
" Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he accused him several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to be president," he said.
An angle of attack that has been beaten since yesterday in the Republican television commercials.
Obama stressed that he was the future.
Without disassembling, he proved himself to be concrete and precise.
He put forward his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCanin has still not understood, while Obama, yes," said, this weekend, a democratic spot accusing the Republican of not taking all the measure of the impact of the crisis on the "American of the street".
"During the twenty-nine minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama said yesterday, in front of 20,000 people for an election meeting in North Carolina under a rain.
He did not even pronounce the words "middle class" or "workers." The financial route clearly benefits Obama, which is considered by the Americans as the most capable of saving the economy on the edge of the precipice.
"The coming week could be a decisive turning point," he loved, yesterday, the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to Bill Clinton's during the financial crisis of 1998.
For the democratic candidate, the current debate "is the final verdict of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reaffirming that it would still be possible to reduce taxes by 95 per cent of Americans despite Wall Street's slumps, the Illinois Senator also noted that the realization of a country's potential energy independence by promoting renewable energy was its first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain, he, wanted to build a 45 nuclear power plant park by 2030.
Prudents, the two candidates ignored the $700 billion financial rescue issues (470 billion) adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Did you notice there was an election, you?"
Young people and opponents demonstrated Sunday evening at the top of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislation in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians met on Sunday evening at the closing of the polling stations on the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against President Alexandre Loukachenko's power: "the dictator, resignation".
Some agree that they have not even voted: "What is good, because they will do what they want from my voice," says one youth.
They do not believe that the regime that has done good to foreign observers in order to re-establish language with the European Union is ready to carry out a democratic shift.
Sanctions, including the ban on visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered by observers to be their own.
They weren't in the opposition.
"We were kept away from the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the decommissioning," said Iouri Potemkine, the spokesperson of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"It is a cosmetic change," says Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate to the 2006 president and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and we have the executive power.
If opposition Members enter Parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry to parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals."
The opposition must therefore enter into the political game because "a dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, enters into crisis and we do not reform ourselves, we risk becoming a protector of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is afraid that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the electoral process, does not recognize the validity of the vote.
She stressed that participation figures were too high, and that the generalization of the vote by anticipation (26%) of the voters in Minsk had opened the vote to all manipulations.
"Did you notice that there was an election, did you? asked the social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be not more than five Members of the opposition to Parliament, those who are best suited to power."
The silence of the night falls on October.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission welcome their success.
Interview - Secure return of blood
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice because Hema-Québec became one of the world's most secure and effective blood suppliers.
And above all, he regained public confidence, which had been seriously broken by the blood scandal contaminated in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In February 1994, the Government of Canada launched a public investigation, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, to highlight the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations that such a disaster should not happen again.
While Judge Krever was delaying his report, some provinces then set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee has fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Hema-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to provide all other provinces and territories.
"In 1998, when Hema-Québec started its activities, almost 38 per cent of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Through efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work in the field during the years that followed, we regained public confidence," she said, before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the Quebec population now had confidence in Hema-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in mind that "trust is something extremely fragile".
From its creation on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, many cases of the human form of the disease of the mad cow, a new variant of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, have been seen in Europe, which has held the fort since its founding in 1998.
"And we didn't know at all if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
It was then based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports that when we do not know it and that a serious disease can result from it, in the event of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a brain degeneration that inevitably leads to death, there are exclusion measures.
In April 1999, therefore, the blood of persons who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980 was refused.
However, a few years ago, it was demonstrated beyond a doubt that this disease was transmitted by blood.
This episode thus showed us that the principle of caution applied had meaning."
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV testing technique appeared on the market: the nuclear acid tests (TAN) that directly detect in the donor blood the presence of the virus itself and not the antibody against the virus, on which the tests used so far were based.
The TANs have made it possible to shorten the mute period, which extends between the time the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than a week.
Thus, there has been a substantial reduction in the risk of some donors being infected without knowledge and not being able to detect them.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, a person of 12 million is at risk of receiving blood contaminated by HIV.
"In other words, this means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, this will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission occurs through a blood product.
I believe that today we can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health," says Hema-Quebec, head of management.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Reunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
Hema-Québec must be constantly vigilant," Dr. Décary went on to point out that, in addition to a secure supply, Hema-Quebec must also provide sufficient supply.
"Necessity increases because the population is ageing.
As anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need to be recharged in red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the network of blood donors, which averages only 3% of Quebec's blood donation."
However, any healthy person aged 18 and over who meets the eligibility criteria may give blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14 per cent of people who offer their blood are not accepted because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they travel in a country where malaria is taking place, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3%, we will be able to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Poor people are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this donor network as they grow older and can no longer give their blood.
However, it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but especially to hold them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Today's life is so frowning, we rarely find time to spend an hour giving of his blood," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec provides not only blood products but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that are almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was already considered a biomedical waste is a rich blood in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the establishment of our thousandth sample of cord blood and we are expected to take more than a thousand per year.
We should start by offering them for strikes at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this blood collection program as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot have access to it," because Hema-Québec has no means to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - The Half-final Impact
The Impact of Montreal qualified for the semi-final round of the elimination series of the first USL division, thanks to a victory of 3-1 (4-3 total targets) to the costs of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and final quarter series match with the total targets, at the Saputo Stadium.
Antonio Ribeiro's ground environment marked the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After a first half without purpose on the one hand and on the other, the David Testo and Rocco Plancentino fields marked the other strands of the Montreal training.
Roger Levesque was the only one to play Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember that during the first round of the return series, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in Seattle Bay.
The Impact will be measured at the Whitecaps of Vancouver in half-final.
On Saturday night at Minnesota, Thunder met a 3-1 deficit in the return match to take it back 4-3, but the Whitecaps also reached the 5-4 semi-final round in total.
The Impact should address the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In brief - Victory goal of Kovalev
The trio number one of the Canadians is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the attack in a 3-2 Canadian victory at the Panthers of Florida last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, marked a goal, Plekanec collected two aids, and Kovalev harvested a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparatory games.
Kovalev won the victory by marking the only purpose of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet, Russia has warned.
I need another match to feel comfortable."
"He tried too much in the first period," said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a good ovation."
Charest on the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude the holding of elections before the end of the year
Instead of the general council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tried to be elected at today's partial election.
"Strengthening the limits of our last great northern border": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual force while remaining in the main lines, after the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was designed a sort of Moulin to images.
On three huge screens, there were spectacular clicks of hydroelectric dams, mining operations, Québec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large means such as during the election period.
In the press, the Prime Minister refused to exclude that he would start the elections this fall, even though he noted that his timetable was very busy.
The "Nordic Plan" is the fourth bread of a "vision" that the prime minister claims to have for Quebec, a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on labour with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister simply explained why the North was "a joy to the immense potential", but did not give time, investment amounts, or specific priority in future projects.
All but a few avenues of what could be further developed: including hydroelectricity, forest, but especially the mining sector, doubled by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds", according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This "territory twice as large as France", "it's in our home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it in us, but it is in us," he insisted, as to show that he was asking for a national founder's myth.
Quebec was built much in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the road towards gold in Abitib, the Quebec engineering, the James Bay.
"It's for us, it's our future," he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a portion of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister stated at the press point.
"It is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time and, when the opportunity arises, I repeat this position on behalf of the government," he said.
In addition, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said, speaking of the transition from the northwest, which will open all year round because of the source of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers the occupation of the territory to be a duty.
And the inhabitants of the Territory, First Nations and Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létoureau (former Pakistani MP of Ungava), have already started consultations with thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place of work started.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a time when "a common vision will be given".
The development of the North would also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be "concerned, ordered and environmentally friendly", he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as continuing with that of the former Liberal Prime Minister.
"Like the liberals before us, we have thought differently to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposed the rebaptization of the Beauharnois Centre in the Adélard-Godbout Barrage.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage who made the Pacific Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa who made the James Bay, our party was able to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
In a press release, he called for another reference, conserving that, the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In addressing Eastmain1a-Ruper's hydro-electric barrier project, Charest stressed that its deployment was planned for 2012.
"It remains among us, but I intend to be there," he entrusted his militants, bringing them with nourishing applause.
In fact, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and no doubt in 2009, did not deviate from the possibility of initiating a poll this fall, as permitted by the law.
He stressed, however, that his timetable was fulfilled, including by a mission from the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal Chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that were passed as a letter to the post: PLQ in particular called for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wished that Quebec should appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they should have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcomed the great lines of the Northern Plan with scepticism.
The Pakistani chief, Pauline Marois, pointed out the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal Government, as it came to power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If he had done so, "we would have made more progress today," said Ms. Marois next to her candidate in Jean-Talon (the vote that is taking place today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said to support the adoption of a Northern Plan by the government.
"But what we want is that it's not just a show," said Sébastien Proulx, in place of Mario Dumont, who is returning from vacations today.
Letter - A Dishonored Country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (Irony) at Harper's office, who allowed himself last summer to tell Louise Arbour that she was a "honey" for Canada.
To bring reproach upon this woman who has waged an ongoing fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration as long as the Prime Minister is surrounded by Stephen Harper himself.
We see a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, not to have repatriated its nationals in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that takes no account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a young teenager at the time of the facts that were accused of him.
The only government, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, rejects its word and leaves a child-soldier in inhumane conditions.
The only one who refers to a parody of justice to assess the accused's guilt.
Let us recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, among other things, advocates for the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to benefit from a fair trial in Canada.
It is this same government that closes its eyes on torture: it doesn't matter if a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, no doubt ever after so many years of exactions.
We are not aware of this yet, but we are currently witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", which Harper continues to burn and which sounds so loud in his mouth.
This is the time when there is no morale anymore: we can harm, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the will of a government chief until now (which will be after October 14th...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that promotes the Vertu, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what our country's reputation and dignity was doing.
Shame, Mr. Toews, she's here, in this resignation, and not elsewhere.
Free opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian speech
In its September 17th edition, Le Devor published a letter by Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President of the Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
In pursuing a Orwellian logic, he claims that the world's largest auffering company has tried to defamate six million against three authors and a small publishing house without salt in order to launch a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of defamation prosecutions, but the law.
Without a doubt, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would it be to lead to ruin who dares to support a position against his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and editors of the book Black Canada will have to spend considerable amounts to prepare their defenses and fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the pockets almost without the bottom of the mine.
In these unequal struggles, the tactics are often to ruin the defenders in order to impose a rule on the friendly who will banish the opposition in addition to exasperating anyone who dares to rethink the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in public opinion that she should have presented her vision of the facts.
In contrast to what is being done in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, discussions in Canada usually take place by exchange of ideas and not by striking off the mattress.
It was sufficient, therefore, for the mine to open its books, files and to establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to have confidence in public opinion and rejects the reverse requests and letters of support from Black Canada's authors.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he could both ask for a "public" debate while ignoring the views of the same public?
In the world of the Vice-President, it seems that this word refers only to fat-paid lawyers and not all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In democracy, even detractors have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or you don't want to understand - Barrick Gold is that the public who supports Black Canada's authors and editors do it primarily because it rejects the brutal way of the mine.
This public is ready to hear and judge Barrick, but on the basis of civilized exchange of arguments, and not as a result of what many perceive as a prosecution-bailion (following the "public debate", Barrick Gold has also filed a stay for the Black Canada authors intimidating them to stop using this term...).
In addition to Mr Garver's surreal speech, the pursuit of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
She refused, in block, the right to quote credible sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the same basis for intellectual work.
If it is not possible to study and discuss subjects that are displaced by the rich businesses of this world in a country such as Canada, under repetitive persecution, what can they do?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so in accordance with the scientific standards used by Black Canada's authors.
She has a right to reply.
The university environment, to which we belong, has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and how to resolve conflicts.
The immeasurable continuation of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place mechanisms that limit such abuse.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and the Congress leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US$700 billion plan to stop the financial crisis that has been fading Wall Street for months still needs to be maintained by both Houses of Congress.
In particular, it provides for better control by the electorate of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the public money, new arrangements to contain the number of houses seized due to default of payment, and a right to look at the salaries paid to the managers of the rescue companies.
The American Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, the President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to put the real economy and the ordinary Americans in the current crisis at Wall Street," the democrat explained.
"This is the fundamental point: if we don't do this, traumatism, chaos and disturbances on American everyday life will be huge," said Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had turned into sprints in recent hours because of fear of the effect that would lead to a new failure on investors' mood.
The time limit was the opening of the markets this morning.
In the late negotiations, the two candidates for the U.S. presidential election proved to be more favourable to the agreement, but they failed to express their dissatisfaction with the fact that they were forced to reach this end.
Senator Barack Obama has been awarded the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, including the one to enable owners to maintain their home and the one on the salaries of the directors of the State's companies.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the waves of American television.
Asked about another channel to know if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, said, "I would like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The great lines I've read [show] that it's something we're all going to have to push and with which we're going to be able to move forward.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable," he said.
The 700 billion plan is designed to redeem with taxpayers' money the suspicious, risky and unsold assets of US financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the break-in of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of mortgage loans at risk (subsidies) before expanding to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAAs) and resulting from a freeze of liquidity and the debundation of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans elected to hold the first draft agreement last week.
We believe we have been out of this impasse ever since the Democrats accepted that some "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only provided by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to round up the angles for everyone in Congress, a provision was also added that if the government had to take losses for five years with this program, it could put in place new taxes to help it recover.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first instalment of 250 billion to which an additional 100 billion may be added if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion should be made by another vote of Congress.
In exchange for his help, Washington will obtain participation in the rescue companies that will pay him dividends in the event of profit and that he will be able to resell when the torture takes place.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay the arrest procedures for housing related to the real estate loans concerned by this plan, as well as to set limits on the remuneration and starting allowances paid to the managers of the affected companies.
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to the vote of the House of Representatives today, and to the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green fire.
Votes have indeed continued to rise against this project yesterday, both in the Republican and Democratic camps.
"Of course Washington doesn't understand you," said Republika Scott Garrett, a member of the Chamber's Finance Committee.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But it's not the one that's making use of taxpayers."
Encouragement by a small group at Congress called "the Caucus of Sceptics", Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred leading economic professors, including three Nobel Prizes, have written to us to tell us: we are asked not to press and carefully examine the way to take," he said yesterday.
At the same time, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis in Europe.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for € 11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The intervention of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas reported that it had refused to acquire its full-fledged competitor since it lost EUR 2 billion (US2.9 billion) in the crisis of real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
"It's not about the lost money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In exchange, there is a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It's just something that savers and households now appreciate that the times are uncertain."
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Manche, the British government seemed to nationalize another bank damaged by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take into account all current loans at Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion (75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the UK bank's branches and customer accounts.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an icon engaged
His beauty in the eyes of the azure was long his map attached, some will say his weakness.
Did he get rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor at the charmer's smile?
Yes, and no.
His powder, his sensitivity and a talent that flowed from the source will also have removed him from the register of power that children the true sacred monsters.
But what a great background runner!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at the age of 83, from a lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the fast years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he looked like and for whom he had long been a sort of rival to the screen, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also the apostle of the freedom and breaking up of the dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, of a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother of origin.
Of these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
No ego unmeasured, last quality mark.
Because it was designed by a whole country of the self-made man, of the war fighter of the Pacific, wounded in battle, who at the beginning of the 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing at the theatre, television, soon at the cinema.
The same man who campaigned for civil rights was also the driver who ranked second at 24 hours of Mans in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The shadow zones of this secret, discreet, committed, allergic to show-business cracks also appear with him, which we will not have completely overcome the riddle.
An honest man, in the most noble sense of the term.
The disappearance of Paul Newman sought the vertigo of the filmmakers this weekend, while his great roles on the black screen were intertwined.
More than half a century of a seventh American art in perpetual mutation shows through it.
Back in memory of Butch Cassidy's charming cowboy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejected his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a hot roof suitable for Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we refer to his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone through history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, a criminal, tortured, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me, by Robert Wise, a role to be played by James Dean after his death, who really launched Newman in 1956.
This charming malfrat in the brilliant The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar of the best film in 1973.
In the magnificent The Hustler game of Robert Rossen (1961), he will recapture the character on the return to The Color of Money of Martin Scorsese, which he was awarded in 1987 by his only Oscar on nine nominations.
That face through the ages, it was him.
He's still there.
The eras go through its path.
Young people are especially familiar with it through George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of a little orthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers.
With a final role as sponsor of the Irish mafia in the Road to Loss of Sam Mendes in 2003, the loop was closed.
In contrast to several legends of the film that soon launched the trade, Newman will remain in the ring for a long time, while reporting Hollywood, its gold, its pastes and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humor, "as a challenge living at "the underplaying" judging his performances too supported.
The profession has not always been tender for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles have long been cooked in the pool.
However, he played less often the first young than the marginals: nervous, alcoholic, saladed or desperate, whose perfect traits reflect the derivatives and revolts.
As a director, Newman reveals poorly known facets of his true pudical sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (after the novel of Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, was drawing a final female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose dedicated his film to Harry and Son in 1984, a work of dust and sadness.
Among the tribute rains that reported yesterday on Newman, his great friend and former weapons partner Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very strongly, "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrating traits of the missing actor.
In addition to his career as a legend, a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a Hollywood-based rival.
We have seen a lot of her benign thrones on pots of wine, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process of making a bad taste, though gag at the start.
However, the benefits of these sales were paid to its Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, rather than sit on his myth, he'll be engaged to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and to the end, your father has been incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us to have followed the course of an American artist so lucid and so generous.
Citizen model, sum and up.
What could Zuchlag &amp; make well in their billing factory?
Next, on 8 October, hearings will begin on the ongoing criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, permanently and regularly, which has caused particularly important damage. Other prosecutors have been accused of fraud, such as false and false use.
According to the survey, the money from subsidies was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money of the state and municipalities, about HUF 65 million in total, went on the one hand into the funds of the Fiatal Balldal movement and on the other, into the pocket of some people.
Their method, also made public by the authorities responsible for the investigation, was to touch the money of subsidies obtained by issuing invoices for which no real benefits were provided and thus the associations never complied with their commitments.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they sought invoices on the Józsefváros market, while they were making caches in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that would appear on the invoices, it was decided, inter alia, during the tour in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the testimony of the latter, he had to find pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on which they would make the other invoices they would introduce, inter alia, with the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as with the Municipality of Capital for access to grants.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his associate András Khartoumri, who, according to our information, was mainly concerned with writing the necessary files for obtaining the grants.
During a "circuit of detection", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place provided the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the Biztos Pont Egyesület association.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice drawn up on behalf of the Jobb Jövârt Foundation, which will subsequently bear the name of Együtt a Harmadik Évesredért, was making mistakes in form and background.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night there. However, the invoice mentioned one hundred and thirty customers.
Billing issuers to the buoyant imagination also fell into excess, when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accounts, neither Jobb Jövârt nor Hoppá would appear, according to the information given to the parquet.
The manager of the company, Gy.z. Farkas, said on the hvg.hu website that when the prosecutor summoned him and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew that it was false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in a bad place on the cache."
He added: "In addition to the form, the fact that, according to the invoice, a hundred people had settled there, did not last, since this facility has only eleven rooms, which have not so much space.
In addition, the invoice also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
The invoice issuers have no longer been informed about the travel agencies in Budapest, which are part of their choice, but are only organizing travel abroad. Thus, they have naively indicated that they are staying in Hungary on invoices to settle in cash, which is also against the accounting practices of the agency.
Moreover, as shown in the investigation, they also add VAT on these documents, while the travel business benefits, whose destination is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices drawn up on behalf of the Révfülöp Hotel in Jobb Jövöert's order was incorrect, since the company's benefits do not support a 25% VAT as indicated, but a 15% VAT. Furthermore, the hotel employees only issue printed invoices, while the fakes were handwritten.
The survey of the survey reveals that the "issuers" also made mistakes by mentioning as a performance the transport of goods by road, that the billing company could not exercise, since its profile was the investment council.
Moreover, it is also for vice versa, such as types of inappropriate invoices and false invoices, that invoices issued in order of Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapitvány of XXI. Századi Culturales Egyesület and Biztos Pont have proved false.
As with Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehértó's sports internship, which both refuse to be the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
Nor did the falsifiers pay any attention to the fact that HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was expected to take a meal at their home. According to our information, that is why the liquidator of the company refused to issue this invoice.
Bills prepared in a deliberate manner
Another category of invoice issuers is the composition of those who were fully aware that they were asked to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapest Alapitvány Foundation, at the request of the Fiatal Balldal - Ifju Socialisták group, has established an invoice in order of the Együtt a Harmadik Évesredért Foundation, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the indictment, Collab Kft.'s manager was forced to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, he cooperated with the Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices to the Jobb Jövört Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlas Egyesület and the Vörösfeny Association Egyesület, for an amount of about five million HUF, but after which no benefit was actually provided.
No financial movement has taken place since the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but this has been avoided by the agencies in their accounts.
The following category of billing companies is that of the companies directly related to the accused.
For example, the administrative delegate of the Director General of Delta Trió Kft., dealing with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles, whose social headquarters was in Budapest, but where it was impossible, was Ivan Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, this company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment for about 18 million HUF.
According to the investigation, these equipment would have been purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since September 14, 2005.
The director of this company was a Romanian-born man, to whom Ivan Kubatov would also have obtained documents relating to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
According to what we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices to Atlas, Hoppá and Együtt a Harmadik Everredért Alapitvány, and that he blocked their counter-value.
It is precisely at Ivan Kubatov's request that Romanian masons created the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies worked, which the accused explains because they did not receive employment.
He still serves these companies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused as well as the editor of the company's works of foundation, he established invoices on their behalf, in the order of associations related to Zuschlag, such as Atlas and Y-Generació associations.
Kubatov gave a total of 15 invoices, issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade companies for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecutor thought that 10% of the invoices and VAT were in Kubatov's pocket.
The man even used Szi-Beri Bt. to produce fictitious invoices that were used in the Biztos Pont grant application.
In January 2006, the Y-Generació and Sjövetség Association in Modern Magyarországért introduced a request for a subsidy from the socialist party's public utility agency, Tancsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They have received this subsidy for a double amount of HUF 500,000, but these amounts have not been used for the purposes set out in the application.
To avoid this, five fictitious invoices received from the Works Team Kft. company were presented to the TMA.
These are the invoices that were found during the search carried out in the Office of Arpád Kemexei, in the Ministry of Education.
During the hearing, a portion of the accused will report the method of manufacturing invoices, as she had already done in front of the prosecutor's office.
What might be really interesting would be that the main accused, János Zuschlag himself, decides to remove the veil throughout history.
So far, his views are not very detailed, and although he has promised to tell the smallest details several times, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or if so, the Socialists would have concluded an agreement that in exchange for the repayment of a large part of the 50 million HUF, Zusi would only wear the hat.
Today, the latter is likely to be seen, since applications for his place of residence under surveillance, on the basis of relief of his conditions of detention, fall continuously into the ears of a deaf person.
While those who have caused much more serious damage, and the perpetrators of non-reparable economic crimes, walk freely or at least wait for their own home to end the procedure.
The psychology of overfill: why do we spend more money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the goods.
Researchers in neurological and economics at the University of New York have been able to update the neurological and economic bases of this behavior known and apparently irrational.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be distanced from this type of competition, such as a sale to auctions on eBay, and that is why they prefer to pay too high a price.
These researches have tried to establish a neurological scheme of this kind of "game" with the help of sales to experimental auctions.
One of the volunteer groups was playing the loto, while the other group was participating in a gaming auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance process (IMMf), researchers analyzed the active brain areas of experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the sale to auctions, the essential element of which is the overfilling of a third, the whole under the brain stem, called striatum, was moving intensively at the loss of the part.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the "auto-stimulation" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the escape from the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the economists of this group of researchers continued financial monitoring analyses.
Under these circumstances, three groups met with a partner in various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and they did so.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they were winning from the party, they would receive 15 additional dollars in reward.
While the third group received this $15 before the auctions, members of the group also lost this money, in case they lost the auctions.
The difference between these two groups is that the emphasis was placed on one victory, while on the other, on failure.
By proving the neurologists' hypothesis, the players' team "against failure" were available at higher positions than those of the control group and the "for victory" group.
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any already existing economic theory.
In fact, each of them did not explain the phenomena found in the sale of auctions except for the pleasure of winning and the parade in front of the risk.
Only the methods of neurological imaging have helped to eliminate the contradiction between the two theories, now based on a third explanation." - Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economic Sciences at the University of New York, noted.
Hepatitis: When do we need to consult a doctor?
In the world, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary chronic liver disease is mentioned among the first causes of death.
A hundred miles is estimated to be the patients who carry the hepatitis virus in Hungary, but only seven miles follow a treatment. This is because often the patients do not know that they are carriers of the virus.
Hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but pathogens and diseases are different.
Hepatitis viruses, according to pathogens, are mainly propagated in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tube (e.g.: food or contaminated water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travellers, it is recommended in any way to be vaccinated against viruses A and B. There is no vaccine against C.
Hepatitis A symptoms appear two to three weeks after consumption of contaminated foods, in general, accompanied by a poor general condition, weakness, stomach discomfort and nausea.
Then develops on the skin and white of the eye a visible jaundice, the cells become clearer and the urine takes a darker color. The healing can take two to three weeks.
Around the world, every year, one million people die from the most serious form of this pathology, such as cancer or liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that according to estimates, only one in ten patients receives medical treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, it may lead to a cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients are not aware of the virus, because the pathogen destroys the liver cells in a subtle way. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
Contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: individuals who had undergone a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
Currently, 200 million patients are diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C in the world.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advised to consult your doctor as soon as you notice symptoms of unknown origin.
The disease can be cured, if it is detected on time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, thus the risk of contagion disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
On 30 September, it is the world day of hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 by the organizations representing the world's four corners of the world.
Its aim is to draw attention to the cirrhosis of the chronic liver, caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does one who believes in God feel less pain?
According to the results of a recent research, religious belief would function as a kind of analgesic, which would have already contributed to making the death of Catholic martyrs more sustainable.
The British daily Telegraph published an article in which researchers at Oxford University made an interesting experience by analyzing the extent to which belief in God could influence tolerance to the pain of the human being.
As part of this experience for the least bizarre, 12 Catholic believers and so many atheists were subjected to electroshocks, while each of them observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of the suffering.
Thanks to a human brain palpation technique, it was also found that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for pain regulation.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiences in which academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university.
More specifically, the experience takes place in the following way: an instrument that emits sparks and disseminates electroshocks is set on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experience to look closely at two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady at the Hermine painted by Leonard de Vinci in the 15th century.
Researchers from the origin of this experience hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary evoked a kind of state of faith among the believers, while the choice of the painting of Da Vinci, not very different from the first, had its calming effect.
Experimental subjects spent half an hour in an IRM scanner, and during that time they received 20 electroshocks in four successive parts, while looking either at the religious theme painting or at the more general theme.
The Catholics stated that in the view of the Virgin Mary, they felt as "safe", as if one of whom were "careful" and they "relieved, and peace invaded them".
In view of the painting of religious themes, they reported 12% pain unless they looked at Leonard's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who took part in the experience himself, thinks that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image, in the atheists, provided that the appropriate photo is found.
"We should find an image against which they react very positively, such as a mother or father," said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of these research.
"The practice of faith should change and, in many cases, really change our personality," Wright added.
After these excellent results, there is no more than the question of what would be the effect on the control of the pain of the subjects if we showed the believers a Madonna painted by Leonard or by a painter of the same size?
Would the view of a better-quality Virgin Mary produce better results?
You're what you're talking about.
On the occasion of his tenth anniversary, Google claims that it can be found at the bottom of the pocket of people as well as the sky above their heads. He knows where they have spent their holidays, what specialists they consult and what their centres of interest are.
However, it is not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential persons of society.
While with regard to skeptics drawing up a parallel with Orwell's horror vision, they do not exactly see the essence of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently stated in the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to gather more information about its users. This is necessary so that Google's founders can meet their initial goal that sounded like this: "Let's gather all the information in a system of the world!".
According to Google's surveyed leader, after ten years of global camouflage work, they are always only at the beginning of their goals to be able to process all the information.
To the question: what will it be in five years? Schmidt answered that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What is the best job I could do?" However, software will not be able to answer this kind of question, simply at first sight, until the day they know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear to all internet users that the words used during Internet research, the IP address of the computer that launches the search and the pages then consulted by interested people are precisely listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own research history and consult what they have looked for, what they have clicked on. Thanks to this, in the long term, Recommendations, the program based on the same logic, will be able to provide much more personalized responses, and will submit us products and services based on our previous statements and our registered preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if he sees what my job is? ask users, who are worried about seeing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by the society that can cause fear, and it is not the remorse, fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or possibly the rebellion against the power that can create a counter-reaction among netizens.
However, it is confirmed that the terms sought are not only recorded, but in justified cases they are transmitted to a third party, and in such a legal case, nothing protects the personal rights of internet users.
The most pressing example of recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information he had gathered on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing for identification.
Interested human rights netizens were able to push a sigh of relief last May, when Google, arm down with the EFF legal protection agency, proved its right to the FBI court. According to the ruling, in the future, Google will not always be forced by any of the points of the constitution to disclose information on the FBI's secret request, of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 research terms it had won in relation to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, voted several years ago. But ultimately, it has not been able to obtain the private user search lists, nor the full list of websites and keywords for the past two months.)
Therefore, Google's judgment is quite contradictory: it's fussed by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think their intimate sphere and private domain suffer when they start using Google's services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of rebellion that we manifest against the proud multinational societies of their conservative image.
During this time, the American geek culture and its "surveillance" bringing together the passionate, activists and enthusiastic users of the computer that appear in many countries in Google see the next generation of big companies, the "linked corporation", by opposition to its rival, Microsoft, catalogued as the world's invader because of Windows, and this, even though both are fighting for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification codes, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and the program package, continuously refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, in view of the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that geeks see very precisely the problematic relationship between human rights and the Internet, and what web 2.0, the most famous keyword in recent years, is just behind it.
In fact, web 2.0 is nothing but collaboration, that we deliberately leave traces behind us, and that we use communication channels at our disposal, and while the size of these changes one by one, the essence remains the same: we are exposed.
A young person, in general, can keep a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link them to other benefits, such as Twitter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then he can link them to a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also hold blogs, where they automatically appear their most recent photo galleries that they store on Flickr or Picasa.
While many examples can be taken into account, such as that of the little friend who easily understands the pictures of the morning, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom his unfaithful friend has spent the evening, or that of the company that has licensed one of his employees, nothing but for the sincere opinions he has written on his blog about top management, we can be on one thing: the term private life is totally to be reconsidered today.
He who lives an online life is made up of what he shows himself, and this is how one can define the principle hiding behind the behavior of today's young people.
He wants to hide something, or at least he wants to try to bypass Google's monopoly, he can do it (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using Google's search system, but at the same time leaving intentionally no trace).
The number of people who deliberately don't register on public pages so that they can't be found is not the least. Google's online services, through text processing in image processing, to read information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not connected to huge server parks and which don't fit our best profile, which has existed to this day.
Public opinion awaits, without really hiding itself, the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than $140 billion, Intel $124 billion, or Coca-Cola $110 billion. AdWords/AdSense advertising areas threaten the number of advertising agencies' business, while the services introduced at an increasingly important rate bring serious migrants not only to Microsoft, but to many other software creators.
However, critical observers find, besides all of this, contradictions with disturbing effects: for example, the top management of the company has refused, in its entirety, employees' protests, after it has doubled the price of the parent company and after the company has found it too costly the multiple daily restoration, taken at any time. All this seems to be derogatory to the fact that already in 2006, Google acquired in front of the Chinese government and according to the terms of their agreement, the company detects all the results that hurt the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the company's internal rules, new services are announced only when they can be used. What is certain is that in the coming months and years, they will move the world on new points. While some think that Google's book and magazine scan and archiving project is taking such important dimensions that the company will soon face the U.S. Supreme Court, others tremble before its Health system, because in this, we can build a complete medical profit from our previous analysis results, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google builds up a genetic database can give a good prime material to the next generation of science fiction authors. The novel of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with half a ton of Orwellian, describes the future in which a man could be approached in an ephemeral way only through Google's data.
Two minors helped to eliminate the traces of the double homicide of Ozd
"The police have summoned two minors to question them in the case of the double homicide of Ózd. According to well-founded suspicions, they have helped to eliminate the traces of the crime." - said the spokesman of the commissioner department of Borsod.
Young people have acknowledged the facts that they are being accused of, and they are being charged with complicity.
The two minors, who are young girls, are free to defend themselves according to the information provided by the ICT (Hungarian Telecommunication Agency).
The complicity of killing can lead to detention that can last up to 5 years.
The suspect of Ozd's double homicide, a young man from the 23-year-old corner, was placed in temporary detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicide, committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, it appeared that the 23-year-old man needed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt and that is why he will attract his creditor, on Wednesday last, on a site of Ozd where he killed him, as well as the little girl of this man, who was 9 years old.
According to the ITI, the young man has premeditated his crime. The weapon with which he was going to commit his hidden crimes on the scene of the crime is evidence.
The police are examining the weapons and the circumstances of their use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the stock exchange package of Prague's stock exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Polish had made despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of the new potential owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the State.
99 per cent of the shares are held by the Polish State, which wishes to separate more than 60 per cent of its shares in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest offer that has been made so far for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the best new owner, and did not exclude the fact that this could result in the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated from 5 to 10 billion Czech crowns by market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The most important owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank, with approximately 25 per cent stakes, followed by 14.7 per cent of the Ceská Sporitelna and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 per cent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their comments on Tuesday on the international financial crisis, increasing daily, the leading newspapers of the European press already mention a "second 11 September".
"The global financial disaster, we owe it to the American president," says the newspaper of Rome, La Repubblica. "The president has not even been able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised at the rush, aimed at bringing relief to a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as billionaire Warren Buffett said, it is more appropriate to speak of a second 11 September.
A part of the Madrid press also sees the emissary in Washington.
According to the vision of the newspaper El Mundo, these are the shortcomings of the political direction there that led the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the US financial system is increasing every day, and then the whole world is going to pay the high price.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, however, after the Congress vote, a real threat, which Washington does not propose as a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the void, just when in the history of capitalism, one of the biggest transformations takes place.
We cannot ignore the threat longer - the Geneva Tags-Azeiger is highlighted.
Some states may still have a life-saving job for their titular financial institutions, and through the money of their taxpayers, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if more banks are falling apart from such dominoes, neither financial resources nor new improvisations will be sufficient.
In the long term, we need the European Union's states to take little account of their national selfishness and to centralise control over the divided financial markets.
On Monday, the weak financial institutions received more than EUR 100 billion - recalled the Vienna daily Der Standard, which adds that the fears that European taxpayers will also have to put their hands on the pocket, very deep, similar to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, are becoming more and more realistic.
So far, the EU has not really been dealing with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, crosses, on its own, the old continent.
The "savers" must not immediately strike a hundred billion euros, however it would be fair if they could note where it would be reasonable to touch taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing further damage.
The smart car imitates the bourdon flights
What method would be best to develop technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle, if it is not the simulation of an existing obstacle detector already in nature?
For example, that one of the bees.
In the surprising project presented at CEATEC, which took place in Japan, burgundy bees gave the initial strategic idea to engineers at Nissan, to inspire them on how to design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built a mini robot car, a bio-inspired auto-robot system, of type BR23C, which has been equipped with quality bees, the ultimate goal being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
In its flight, each bee constitutes its own oval-shaped space, which, in fact, looks much like our safe protective shell - explained, during the exhibition, Kazuhiro Doi, the director of the research and development department and the brand's technological public relations.
The eye to the face of the bee plays a key role, since it is able to see in all directions, in an angle of 300 degrees.
To imitate the functions of the face-to-face eye, engineers have approached the idea of the laser telemeter.
It identifies the obstacles in an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 metres before the BR23C, evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the microprocessor, which transforms it into a avoidance maneuver immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it from an angle sufficient to avoid collision.
Unlike any system currently existing, this avoidance process is entirely instinctive.
"If it wasn't so, the mini robot couldn't react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotized car project.
It must react instinctively and instantaneously, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and internal layer of the protective envelope, a layer where the collision is considered inevitable for the moment.
All this process must reflect what the bee does to avoid the other bees.
The process must take place in an eyelid.
Unlike bees, the difference cannot go upward, downward or diagonally, it can only be two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn.
In this way, instead of endless combinations of bees to avoid other bees, in our case, we could only use the rotary movement, acceleration and slowing down as maneuvers at the disposal of the mini robot
The BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and with a higher concentration of energy, making them longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is primary, not data processing, and even less capacity to store.
This mechanism should only treat a few incoming signals per second, and respond to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with intuitive logic based on the data of previous maneuvers. Thus, it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of continuous memory.
There is no need for memory of a capacity of giga-bytes, or even mega-bytes.
This is the first step towards designing a technology for instant avoidance. According to Nissan's estimates, this system will enter serially manufactured cars in the next ten years.
Another application could be incorporated into the GPS satellite navigation system so that it can guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles on its way.
We even gave a name to the baby out of price
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue plan to buy suspicious bank loans, and to use several times, is ready.
In the first turn, half of this amount will be spent.
Reuters announces that during new debates extending until midnight, Saturday, local time on the east coast, Congress leaders have agreed on the disputes that have existed for days and days, around a total life-saving plan of $700 billion.
"We have taken a serious step forward," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the American House of Representatives, who said that there is nothing left but to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, based on the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
The US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said by commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and will be effective, but other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, it is not a question of saving Wall Street here, but of turning the wheels of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets, Sunday evening at 8:00 p.m., Washington local time (i.e. Monday at 2:00 p.m., according to Central Europe local time), but did not cause a spectacular rise in the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote in favour of the bill in the name of the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilisation Act, and then its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke in Pelosi, and then the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are pleased with the progress made this evening, and we deeply appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, the spokesperson of the White House.
In addition, the programme diverges from the initial proposal made by the Bush Administration, which it mentioned that $700 billion had to be spent at once for the purchase of securities on suspicious credits.
The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the adoption of the Act by Congress, probably on Monday. The first one will be used by the Treasury Secretary to purchase suspicious bank claims, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left to the discretion of the President.
The programme will be supervised by an independent agency, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also take part.
The expenditure of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree of Congress.
Under the law, the Treasury secretariat will be able to put in place a combined strategy: at the same time, it will be able to buy suspicious claims, securities on suspicious mortgages and mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" claims.
The departmental authorities have stated that purchases may take place as part of a sale to auctions, but also directly.
The rule allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme, where the Treasury secretariat guarantees the tools of concern for which companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson stated that the law provides the necessary tools to provide $700 billion for the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it is the large purchase of suspicious claims, insurance, or the risk of seeing the system collapse of one or the other important financial institution.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready for the application of the law as soon as it is signed" - he added.
On the other hand, bank leaders in poor positions and waiting for State aid can expect their starting allowances, simply called extra-Atlantic gold parachute, to be captivated by the government.
In addition, the limitations depend on the way in which the Treasury secretariat offers its assistance to the company.
The principle of ceilinging means that if the Treasury secretariat buys in the context of a sale to auctions, they will receive an excess tax on the gold parachute, unless the discredited bank president leaves for retirement.
Immediately after the purchase of suspicious claims, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not excessive.
In order for the picture to be complete, however, it must be added that the existing gold parachutes are not modified. The ceiling only concerns the new contracts, this in order to motivate participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal ceilings will be in force on the appointments of the Directors-General - the chairman of the Committee on Financial Benefits of the Chamber of Deputies, Democrat Barney Frank, commented.
In addition, the State provides for a right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the plan, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they may even be winning in the case as soon as the economy and with it the banks saved fall back on their feet.
The draft law states that in the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal that will determine how the losses will be reimbursed to taxpayers, from the financial sector.
On both sides, there were of course those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That is not why US citizens have given us orders, which does not protect taxpayers' dollars - said the Republican Member of California, Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, thinks that it is the same who is presenting action, as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to increase
In August 2008, domestic industrial sales prices increased by 0.1 per cent over the previous month, and 12.9 per cent over the month of August 2007 - reports the Central Statistics Office of Hungary.
Industrial export sales prices increased by 1.1 per cent compared to July 2008, while compared to the previous year, they decreased by 3.9 per cent.
As a result of the fluctuations in domestic and export prices, industrial production prices increased by 0.7 per cent over the previous month and by 3.2 per cent over the previous year.
Domestic industrial sales prices have progressed only to a lesser extent: 0.1 per cent, compared to the previous month.
The domestic sales prices of the processing industries were only slightly higher by 0.1 per cent compared to July.
In August 2008, the most significant price increase was observed in the leather and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8 per cent), with first of all, the production of bags and belts with a monthly increase of 4.6 per cent, then the production of footwear with 2.5 per cent monthly increase.
The higher prices of raw plastic and chemical materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the manufacturing sector of products and chemicals (1.6 per cent).
This has resulted in a deflation in the oil processing sectors (1.4 per cent), in the manufacture of electrical machinery and equipment (0.9 per cent), and a minimum increase in the wood processing sector (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
The other sectors of the processing industry have recorded an increase of between 0.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, which represent an important weight in national industrial production, prices have risen by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in the gas price established by the authorities since 1 July.
In a 12-month comparison, taking into account the domestic sales of the processing sectors, these are the prices of the oil processing sector that have experienced the most significant increase (32.4 per cent).
In the manufacture of metallurgical products, an increase in prices of 13.2 per cent was observed, while in the important area of food production, beverages and tobacco prices increased by 11 per cent.
Price reductions have taken place in the textile and textile production sectors (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of machinery and electrical appliances (0.3 per cent).
In the other sectors of the processing industry, price increases ranged from 0.6 per cent to 9.1 per cent.
In the whole of the processing industry, prices have risen by 10.2 per cent over the past year.
The prices of electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors exceeded 18.7% of those of the previous year.
Among the domestic trade groups and according to the allocation of sectors, in August, these are the investment profit-initiating sectors that showed the most significant monthly price increase (0.7 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, while those in the energy and materials production sectors for subsequent transformation did not experience any change compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the most significant increase in energy production and subsequent transformation materials (16.8%) was observed.
In the consumer goods production sectors, inflation was measured by 6.8 per cent, while in the profit-initiating sectors, there was a fall of 1.4 per cent.
Sales prices for exports from the industrial sector, in HUF, increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, while they fell by 3.9 per cent in 12 months.
In one month, our national means of payment fell by 1.7 per cent compared to the euro, and by 7.1 per cent against the dollar. Compared to August 2007, it increased by 7.5 per cent against the euro and by 15.9 per cent against the dollar.
Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz thinks there are good chances that by the 12th of January, the U.S.-Hungarian visa exemption agreement will come into force. This is what the Minister of Foreign Affairs told Chicago, in front of the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her, "now everything depends only on the time when the extra-Atlantic electronic input and control systems will be put into service."
At the same time, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system, there will be no entry visas, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations from today in Washington.
He will meet with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Condolezza Rice, to whom he will return the decoration of the Commander's Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with foreign policy advisers from candidates to the presidency, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support the bank rescue plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama, like John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major American parties, supported the Government's saving plan of $700 billion. However, there are politicians who demand the resignation of the American Secretary of Treasury.
After the marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, representatives at Congress and the Administration finally announced, on Sunday at dawn, that they had concluded principles on bank rescue.
This funding plan, aimed at defusing the Wall Street crisis and the paralysed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each as more capable than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with the introduction of economic issues, Obama again managed to find some progress. McCain's advance, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as a collister just after the republican convention, was founded.
During a campaign meeting held in Detroit, on Sunday, Obama expressed its hope that Congress would quickly vote on the 700 billion-dollar rescue bill.
He stressed that the proposal contained consumer protection passages that he also supported.
"It is now necessary to act, with responsibility (...) a danger threatens your work, your economies, industrial sectors as a whole and the stability of the entire economy" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
There was no lack of qualification for McCain's economic ideas.
In an interview given to the ABC chain, McCain said: "We all have a bad time getting down (...) but doing nothing is not a possible way."
The Republican Senator stated that the proposal mentioned the establishment of a Treasury control committee and the ceilinging of the starting allowances for senior executives, and that he was, personally, very attached to these points.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had no role on the merits in the negotiations, while he was in everyday contact with the Treasury Secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, President of the House of Representatives, said on Sunday that there is serious hope that the House will vote on the bill from Monday.
Press review of the German language territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only in the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - this is how Der Spiegel, the low CSU score in the Bavarian country.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the red and black coalition.
The mirror (e.g. mirror.de)
In the online edition of the German left-wing information magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the CSU's dramatic defeat in his article entitled "The Revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers."
According to this well-known politician, CSU's erosion began well before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took on his duties.
The Christian Socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now these same modern citizens are turning their backs on them.
This change of time is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, failure was not quite a surprise, but on Sunday, a process that was likely to come to an end ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU collected 47.7 per cent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 per cent level.
This was repeated three years ago during the elections of the Bundestag in 2005, that is, at the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause may be attributed to the modernization of "eating its parents", established in the region in a consistent manner by the CSU.
For 40 years now, sociologists have been predicting this, but they have been greatly deceived about the pace. However, secularization, the results of education and the establishment of Germans in the north and east in the Bavarian region, in full development, could not be left to the detriment of the faithfulness of the CSU electors.
Modernization is going to be in line with the increase in opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more aware, more critical and more stubborn.
It is also surprising that during the last few weeks, it is precisely the groups of classical citizens who have moved far away from the CSU, such as independent, artisans, tank owners and graduates of higher education.
In these groups, CSU support fell below 40 per cent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who? With whom? The party presidents are on the reserve against the issues of the coalition", the conservative Austrian daily is dealing with the situation of the confused domestic policy that was established after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the SPE wish to discuss with the Conservatives of the SPE.
The EPP prohibits SPÖ from meddling in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ populist party is open to negotiations. The Greens do not yet want to agree on the coalition.
The elections took place, now all round the coalition; during debates on public television, party leaders were barely allowed to interview their cards.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SPÖ, confirmed that he would like to discuss with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is indeed possible - that is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as vice-president, remains open on Faymann's side.
As he mentioned, Schüssel-Multererer's orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of question.
Many have responded with caution to red proposals.
As he has already said, collaboration will certainly be fruitless if Faymann tries to get involved in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
In his party, the choice of opposition or the entry into the coalition is currently an entirely open issue, and these points must be debated absolutely within the ØVP.
Jörg Haider, President of the BZÖ, is once again open to all proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of red and black, we are prepared to assume government responsibilities," Haider said.
Járóka said: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Equal Opportunities Summit, which hosted France, began in Paris as a representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In his message to the plenary assembly, as one of the main spokespersons of the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, Euro MP Fidesz European People's Party, drew attention to segregations in education, because it is a violation of the law that affects the most Roma children and therefore one of the main brakes to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened on the one hand by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and on the other, by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to participate in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of legal protection and European civil society organisations, in the area of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the group of MP Fidesz Popular Party, Járóka predicted that, in addition to the distinctions found in the recruitments, Roma disappear from the labour market, first and foremost, as a result of their low qualifications.
"A overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have secondary degrees, and as a result of an elementary education of poor quality, only a small part has the possibility of obtaining a higher degree."
In addition, Járóka stressed that education as a fundamental right of human beings plays a key role in asserting other fundamental rights.
Investment in early education for Roma children means strengthening the economy of the European Union member countries.
According to the honourable Member, it is necessary to raise awareness of these reports in the widest possible circle, including between the Roma and the non- Roma.
Indeed, the sooner a Roma child starts school, the more likely he is to become a productive member of the labour market; by taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the State budget.
"By their nationality of the European Union, Roma must be assured of their right to quality education, and protected from low quality and sectarian education," said Lívia Járóka.
According to the honourable Member, cooperation from the European Union towards an objective and action is necessary for the immediate acceleration of the process of de-registration of schools, and compliance with the existing anti-discrimination directives and in preparation is of primary importance.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken. The opportunities provided by democracy must be given to Roma children, so that they can participate as citizens of the right to the future of Europe," said Járóka.
On behalf of the European Year for Equal Opportunities for All, the objective of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organised each year since the Berlin Summit last year is to provide a single platform to support measures taken to promote equality of opportunity and to combat discrimination at European and Member State level.
CSU: the grace for a transitional period
The decision on the fate of the Huber-Beckstein duo will be taken in October.
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavarian CSU summits has been updated.
The president of the party, Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still keep their place.
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a 17 per cent catastrophic loss of voice, will be on the agenda of the convention of the exceptional party, held last weekend of October.
In any event, the members of this very critical couple felt that they were not particularly at their seat.
Thanks to this, they used to calm down the angry members of the fraction and base, which one day after the "bavarian tsunami" required personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under Edmund Stoiber's leadership, at the top of his career - the socio-Christian union won 60.7 percent, while today, one year after the Putsch against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of their strength remains.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "only sovereign" of Bavaria giving 18 percent of German GDP.
But the conservatives are still very strong in this southern region, of key importance for the Hungarian economy. In the future, they will be forced into the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganization of the party, the Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor of Huber, also received a place in this modest group of recognition, which initiates talks with the FDP Liberals, as well as with the Free Voters, trained along the right-wing values, about a possible coalition of the Government of Munich.
A strange foot of fate has been that with the help of the list of the Free Voters, the Gabriele Pauli legislation, whose action against Stroiber has served as a possibility of putsch carried out by Duo Huber-Beckstein, then treats the very ambitious municipal political woman without housing.
Now, CSU leaders are putting all their energy into stabilizing Beckstein in one way or another.
In this transition, Stoiber, who has so far been pulling the triggers in the hives, will also receive an active role. The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, designated September 28th as the most passionate day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some aberrations towards the CDU. According to him, they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defect as a warning to the CDU and also to Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will be able to be chancellor again only if they are on foot in one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hiding her disappointment caused by the failure, the loss of the land of the CSU will not adversely affect the large Berlin coalition.
This is relative, however, because it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the socio-democratic crisis is still hard.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - its rivers : 110 - 0
No opposition MP joined the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to the Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexandre Lukashenko, which ensures its prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by the illegality committed when the votes are disposed of.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people in this country of 10 million people has been very opposed for decades before yesterday's elections, the opposition linking its forces under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) was seriously hoping that Lukashenko, renewing his presidency for the fourth time during the dubious elections, would "allow" this time the presence of several members of the opposition to parliament.
In this way, the ODSZ gave up its originally planned boycott.
The fact that Belarus, economically increasingly dependent on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where due to Belarus's well-known anti-democratic political order, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians did not receive entry visas, was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarus has to take credit because of the decrease in imports of Russian natural gas, increasingly expensive, and has thus contributed to the transition of Beltransgaz, the owner of gas pipelines across the country, to the hands of the Russians.
The fact that the OSCE, when assessing the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than on shortcomings, such as the ban on a third of the opposition candidates, made reference to a prior settlement.
However, the OSCE communication on Monday already contested the campaign, during which the majority of opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and particularly the fact that the opposition could not be present when the votes were dropped.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a tangible improvement in the political regime: political prisoners have found freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize South Ossetia and separate Abazzia from Georgia. However, Russia, with which Belarus forms a confederation on paper, has been considering the two independent territories for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward, and one step behind, but the most important thing is that dialogue has been started between Belarus and the EU," said Alexandre Milinkevich in our newspaper.
According to the candidate for opposition to the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this should remain so, although "power has been afraid in this parliament that has no weight, to make even one opponent come in."
The opposition does not provide for protest actions in the light of the results. Instead, it tries to bring its message on the need for economic reforms with voters.
"Of course, we are very concerned about this: we have to print our opposing newspapers in Russia, the local authorities put us in the wheels for broadcasting, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of older people," said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that in the current Lukashenko regime, which considers social security as its main result, the layer of the most officially supported pensions does not really consider it appropriate.
"Because of the country's debt and the increase in the trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'invoking the silence of a cemetery', is no longer just a matter of time" - Milinkevich estimates.
Unlike the opposition politician, the Russian observers have qualified for democratic elections.
Serguei Lebedev, leading the mission of the Community of Independent States, told the Russian press agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in acts." Thus, the absence of opposition is only proof of the maturity of the Belarusian electors.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work."
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, had there been no turning doors for the entry and exit of the employees.
But from now on, this new measure is in force against the small mills, against which it points and then drinks coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-fouling novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The Brunetta- storyteller doors are an instrument for better working, with more productivity, more presence and more services," says the Minister.
Now begins a new season of responsibility and transparency.
"It's reformism" is also highlighted by Brunetta.
The installation in all the institutions of the Presidency of the Council is completed with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of rotating doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance on the part of employees has been recorded, the Secretary-General assures us: "It is a process shared by employees, and we have had the cooperation of all."
In short, more breakfast during working hours; more coffee or growing.
Brunetta's promise, which suggests with a smile, "a good cappuccino at 7:00 in the morning is an excellent and healthy resolution".
At a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
of Rome, the minister reports that "in three months, the absence of public employees' disease has decreased by 50%, or 60 thousand workers over one year".
And it adds that it is essential to make the Public Administration more effective.
Italian, "of the wage dynamics - the minister explains - these last 8-10 years have doubled over the private sector, and in addition to inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees gathered to challenge the standards of the Brunetta Decree applying to Codacons.
"While the Minister of the State Public Service today maintains the data on the decline of absenteeism in the workplace due to illness - the association of consumers - the people of the "active offenders" continues to increase.
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of employees of the correct and productive Public Administration met to declare war against the illegal standards contained in the decree.
In particular, the Tar contests the exclusion of additional sickness benefits for service reasons; the extension of the hours of permanent residence of the sick worker, during which checks are made, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions required by the Minister.
Accidents at the workplace, Napolitano: "Cross Prevention"
Every day in Italy there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 deaths and 27 persons who remain permanently disabled.
In 2007, data from Inail confirmed that white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of the phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death, almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
In order to draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and the media on this dramatic aspect, Anmil is celebrating today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Labour Accident Victims, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The disturbing data released by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of these last days, confirm the importance of the subject of workplace prevention," says the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of Anmil, the National Association of Mutilists and Invalids at Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his sincere appreciation for the continued associative effort to prevent workplaces, protect workers from accidents, assist the families of victims and raise awareness of public opinion.
"Of course angry, everyone has hit the point to put an end to such tragedies, which, in their dimension, provoke the cry of the media and the participation of public opinion, even though the daily reality presents us with dramatic, even repetitive cases in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there must be a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty, keeping an eye on this phenomenon, not to assess the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
On the other hand, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber stressed the extent to which "this phenomenon of the white dead is an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of all of us, and imposes on all institutions a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly."
The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths even though impressive" later highlighted the President of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not wish that this "frequent trend" translates into a minor attention, because it is just when the attention relaxes, that the tragedy happens.
"we believe that in general, we do not do enough to counteract the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be done through multiple actions."
"We have pointed out that more controls and inspections are needed, as well as a more important intervention on the training of workers, and this, from school."
- He added - "that further effort should be made with regard to the communication and awareness-raising of public opinion.
"But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon that is a social emergency."
"Markandelli then denounced "the gradual deterioration of the conditions for the provision of compensation for victims of work" and the "derivative of assistance to which the system has been geared in recent years".
"The objective, therefore, is to give the worker the guarantee of insurance – he added – so that the fate of the person who has an accident should not depend on spontaneousism or the extension of the legislator"
Mp3 player points from the finger, they put the hearing at risk.
Listening to full-volume music for a long time using portable musical devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing injuries.
This is what the European Commission announces, which, in a communication published in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Unforeseen and Recently Identified Health Risks (Csseri) of the EU, published today.
"of this scientific report we read in the note that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to full-volume music using portable musical devices, for more than one hour per day and per week, risk a permanent loss of auditory capacity."
"I am concerned that a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and full-volume mobile phones can unintentionally damage their hearing in an irreparable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"According to scientific data, the responsible Ue- continues to be a clear risk and we must react quickly.
What counts most is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
In addition, we need to re-examine existing control systems in the light of scientific opinion so that they are fully effective and can follow new technologies."
Brussels asked the independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable musical instruments and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise generated by them.
"Scientists conclude the executive U- confirm that there are good reasons for concern, and that the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and other stakeholders what measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents against exposure to noise from portable musical devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of 100Db portable musical devices, but concerns increase about hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these data using solutions such as reduction of levels and noise exposure.
The Scientific Committee notes that users of portable musical devices, who listen to full-volume music (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, are currently exceeding the limits for maximum noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for extended periods risk permanent loss of hearing capacity after 5 years.
This interest 5-10% of these devices users, and their number can be quantified to around 2.5 million and 10 million people in the U.S.
Rome, Germany has ordered the Commission to leave for the future of capital.
Today we begin, in March we end, in June we will draw the sums.
This is the schedule set by the Chapter for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which took place this morning in the new seat behind the Thermes de Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
In March, when they are completed, the Committee and the Joint Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, so as to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its Mayor Gianni Alemano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented in it - it would like to point out that Germanno will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome which will be used by political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Community Council.
No overposition of roles, but only the desire to have a corner where to develop a large project for Rome.
In March, it will finish its tasks and then disappear, as this experience must have a precise time.
In June, the mayor will present the strategic plan of work carried out by the Commission for the Future of Rome Capital."
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Germany says: "All depends on the work the Commission will be able to do, as well as on the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as well as in Rome, I am sure that its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is driven by day-to-day management and time-consuming emergencies.
On the contrary, we want to see the future, and beyond, towards a deeper perspective, seriously working on the development of Rome and its future."
Moreover, the mayor of Rome wishes to stress that "this Commission is not an unnecessary agency or a bureaucratic set: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to the Roman citizens, and will serve to study and participate in the best intelligences that the Capital expresses.
For Alemano, in fact, "a draft of strategic reference, whether firm or immovable, is needed to enable our city to improve, what it absolutely needs, while thinking about its future now a unitary spirit,".
A future that, according to the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the common frontiers, but which will look further" not only from the perspective of the future Metropolitan City and its legal status of Capital, but also from the role that Rome can and must have, as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama, the first anti-American president, that's why.
A well-known American politician who wants to become independent wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, on the basis of his decisions, destroyed the US economy and had reports (as well as he still has today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
The attacks on Obama are increasing as the date of the elections approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on a website: "this person is full of ambition."
Obama is really hungry: he thinks he will win the highest position of a nation that has two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, these are attacks that don't say much; they are obviously racial attacks, and they don't answer the question of all voters: will it be a good president? We also have polls, who say that Obama will win and with good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who talks with the heart and not the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in southern United States, wrote an article: Once in the polling room, we know who the American patriot will vote for.
This emerges from an aspect of American mentality kept secret to the end.
"Say what you want, we'll see ourselves putting the cross on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things have never been revealed so far, so far that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
In any event, despite all this reasoning, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
We asked 1,500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his term of office? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
America's changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 miles of soldiers and was sent back to its home at foot.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and Americans were not forced to make suitcases.
Despite this, Iraq has been, for the most part, Bush's weakness point.
Who will take the place of George W will have a huge stake to accomplish.
Usea, the economic breakdown makes itself felt even among journalists: in the press, it is time for the abolitions. And many accuse the Internet, this "killer" of the newspaper paper.
Five hundred American journalists were interviewed by the Pew Research Center about their status and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly declare the information attachments, but felt less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem of American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is an economic model crisis that has been destroyed.
In addition, the deletions in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work at the newspaper assembly, are a major problem.
It is a problem that should be solved, according to the interviewed journalists, if traditional journalism, as the general public understands it, is not reduced accordingly.
A more complex phenomenon of pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and press journalists are convinced that journalism at the national level is following a bad path.
Locally, the executive group is 65%.
Published against broadcast.
Journalists have no problem seeing where the web is going.
The biggest publishing houses were turning to the Internet, perceived by many as "the killer" of the newspaper.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists is increased to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to the technology hoping to "do something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest crack in American journalism lies between those who run the newsrooms - that is, the directors - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of directors at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage falls to 23%.
For some, this is linked to "work safety".
Directors who intend to lose their 3-year-old position are 47% at the national level.
As far as journalists are concerned, we are going to 30%.
The one of the "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13 per cent of journalists work under contract.
In an immense nation like Usa, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and this quickly becomes a matter of taking or leaving.
Directors receive almost always large salaries, while the editor can earn $100,000 per month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
With regard to holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in total, a number of years passed.
But according to their revelations, American journalists are often "sick" during the year.
It's the fault of the climate.
UNIPOL: THE TRIBUNAL OF ROME, DANILO COPPOLA IS GROTTAFERRATA.
The President of the Second Criminal Section of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the case of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to leave his town, Grottaferrata, for a dwelling in Rome.
Coppola is investigated for banking in the context of the Unipol-Bnl scale instruction.
During the trial at his office last week, he had obtained the release of a house converted into compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the real estate agent to be able to travel the city of the province to a home in the capital.
According to the court, such movements (which the PM has not granted) would allow him to influence his company and have access to the evidence that accuses him.
The elites are in danger.
The phenomenon had already appeared a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the $700 billion bailout plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and is still more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times yesterday that confirms it by telling us that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, which is even more shared between its vigilant East Coast, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and the world of finance, which is particularly powerful in the Central and South States.
The soul, precisely, which has become despotic with the vote I was speaking to you at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is not just an example of the changes, the major changes that the current economic earthquake is foretelling or is already running: not only in the United States, but in the whole of the West, and it can only be here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to speed up the phenomena that have been covered for some time, so that, in the new climate, they are consolidated and revealed.
The first of these phenomena is the revitalization, the extraordinary relaunch, of the dual state-sovereign category, compared to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis is, in fact, a crisis of banking and financial institutions which, of course, have close relations with foreigners, but which, above all, are largely involved in the balance sheets of people and families living in one country, in one state.
This immediately creates a political problem for the government: that is how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically, it is almost here nationally.
Political internationalisation seems really out of play or not to have much to say: the clear evidence is provided by the European Union, which, shared as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, does not reach a common policy line.
And so, it is from the government of each State that all expect interventions, rescue and relaunch plans, new rules, and above all a credit allocation: when we go through a difficult time, there is only the States that have the economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to put things back in place.
They also have the necessary means and legitimacy to use them: two resources of invaluable value, elements that no market or international organization can ever have in a similar way.
This new focus of the state crisis is in perfect harmony with the ever greater importance that the more recent economic developments in the economy tend to be attributed to a sufficiently related factor: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we were now entering the realm of the network, of ever more sophisticated technology, of non-material, and convinced that globalized finance was now intended to dominate the world, we realized once and for all, that our future would have to settle its accounts more and more with rather little material things such as water, crops, oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another from the earth, but which are absolutely linked to a limited space, to a territory.
So he who is sovereign has more cards than he who is not, that is, he who has the evil to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, provides for a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably said Policy, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergence phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for someone who knows how to handle the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leadership, economic species that have proved to be inadequate and full of shadow zone.
And also, something deeper, in a certain sense, even worrying: a discredit, suffering, an image of inequality, a sense of distance that tends to involve the whole class of directors in a growing number of Western countries.
This increases the conviction of the different classes, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elite so far, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, having at the same time, and being increasingly foreign to the opinions of the majority.
in short, the demand for leadership, subterraneanly feeding, a powerful and ramified movement of delegation of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which are manifested in the improvised "vote" electoral revolutions or, in the changes in collective moods of recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria Bavaria, to the fall of workers in Britain, to the rebellion of American congressmen against Bush (and it may well not happen that the victory of the right in Italy was by accident).
It is felt that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their intellectual credentials, their format, would say someone, have more and more difficulty, which does not date today, to understand and therefore to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis is strengthening, increasing and acting potentially in a measured manner.
In view of all this, speaking of a current "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda, seems to be frankly exaggerated.
But we say good, keep your eyes open, that's not without reason.
The supercool to walk on the walls.
Win the laws of gravity by means of a super collar and, in the future, walk on walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various U.S. research centres, and today, a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measuring barely 2.5 cm square, the researchers managed to maintain a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
The U.S. journal Science published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know who use a special structure of carbon, called nano carbon tubes.
"The principle of the glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a spaghetti pile." explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by geckos' legs, covered with microscopic hair that ensures the animal, a perfect adherent.
The tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time that it "is easily detachable from the wall" explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton University of Engineering.
MARCHER ON THE MURS? –"This material could be used as a temporary adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Could be to walk on walls like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since carbon nano tubes are drivers of heat and electric current.
Other applications could concern aerospace engineering.
For now, no super heroes.
THE OTHER RESEARCH - Berkeley University, California, also dedicates itself to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, California researchers presented a microfibre adhesive like hair, which automatically cleans up dust during the movement on a surface to ensure perfect and constant adherence.
Medicines: never with fruit juices.
Attention to cotton juice, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, especially those consumed during the summer because they are defattenable and rich in vitamins, if they are associated with certain vital medicines, alter the absorption by amplifying or decreasing, as appropriate, their effectiveness, with even serious health consequences.
David Nailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices that they are, in box or charge, if they are associated with the intake of certain medicines; during the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launches a new alarm: a glass of cotton juices, oranges and apples is sufficient to reduce the absorption of certain vital drugs, nullifying their beneficial effects and endangering patients' health.
The Pamplemousse juice has already been strongly criticized for being held responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-staminal and neurological drugs up to toxic levels.
MEDICINAL PRODUCTS - It is the Italian Medicines Agency itself, which gave the news in a two-year information bulletin, warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the risk of this mixture and to be careful that you drink if you take medicines such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT THAT PAMPLEOUSSE- According to experts, even the orange juice and apple juice contain substances that inhibit medicines.
Long is the list of active principles inhibited by the Pampelmouse and other juices.
From there, Michele Carruba, director of the Department of pharmacology at the University of Milan: "These findings are generally reported immediately to the various national and international drug agencies that will need to change the information notes of the drugs.
The illustrative papers of the medicines to be taken should always be read and, if something is not clear, should not be impressed, but should be clearly addressed to the physician or pharmacist" the expert pointed out to Ansa.
The Nobel Prize for Economics at Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize for the Economy was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a neo-keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest criticisms of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman had written, in an article published in the New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A forecast that has sparked many controversy, which has been blamed on the economist for years, but which has now proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked by the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from public attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "very valuable economist", but also a very aggressive style distributor, particularly critical of the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration.
Open Office, here is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the day of the public disclosure of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source of personal productivity that aims to touch more and more users, from home to office, professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
After almost a year's work, carried out by voluntary developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is shown to the general public with various news: the welcome screen, and the revised and less austere interface, to others more important, such as the compatibility created for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and the support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007, and it is possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, some specific functions to some modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for e.g., for sending them by email, or for importing PDF files into the graphic development module, keeping the original aspect of the page.
Still on this front, it is possible to create "hybrid PDF" documents that link the typical Adobe format graphics to the elements of a spreadsheet or a text developer.
Collaboration between several people is an element that has had several improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet, several users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on the amendments, in the drafting of texts, because each collaborator is assigned a comment colour for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring some OpenOffice functions on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they should issue the final result.
The Italian version is downloadable at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmlet and is added to the English version on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is also available as a custom for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD may be sent to the home or to the workplace.
And if the theme of free will can be a way of spreading it in homes, it's just in business, that the Open Office then tries the big challenge, which can already rely on various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
Regardless of the realities that provide a training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the Word equivalent video; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the rival presentations of PowerPoint;Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on databases; and Drwa is the graphical module.
Target for 2008, to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are nearly 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected number
Kohl is also positive, this is the fourth doping case.
New case of positivity in the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and the winner of the best climber's heel.
It's the site of the newspaper The Team reporting the news.
At 26 years of age, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist in Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests carried out on Kohl's samples are part of those carried out in the last few weeks, by the Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the anti-analyses confirm the positiveness in Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place in the Tour and will have to wait for two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's positive attitude in the third generation was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordery, who communicated to the Associated Press, notified the positive attitude to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed himself on the podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, thus ripping off the pistachio of the best climber.
IMMEDIATELY: NEW YORK TIMES ARE YOU WONDERING IF ITALIAN IS RACIST?
Italy "as a country of immigrants has recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" was welcomed with reticence.
Would this transform the beautiful country into a racist nation? That's what the New York Times said, which devoted a long article on the subject of racism to Italy, referring to the case of young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a cookie box.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "north paradox": the Nordic regions are both "more integration and more work", but also "the strongest anti-immigrant feeling of the country and the most important support to the Northern League"
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, NYT also referred to the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parme, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
Even the new legislation required by the Lega to stop immigration and facilitate the expulsion of clandestines is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
A trend highlighted by the Pope and by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano at his meeting with Benedict XVI in Quirinal asked that the State and the Church work together to overcome racism."
Students who are victims of expensive rentals, up to 900 euros for a room.
The rental market for students did not know about the crisis
According to Sunia's latest survey, the tenants' union, renting a simple room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to exclude the entire categories of young people, the right to study because of the very high global costs that families of origin must support - explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities, the strong demand by the students so distorted the market that a process of generalized increase has begun for residents.
In most cases, rental offers also include a series of violations: free, unregistered, without rent limit, sub-loans.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the tax review are needed to calm prices.
By reading in detail the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a simple room, we go from a minimum of 650 euros (Black Band area), an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria area)
In Florence, an average cost bed, 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in nearby areas of the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a double bed, and 370 to 500 for a simple room.
In Rome, in the nearby areas of central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), approximately 600 euros are requested for a simple, 450 for a double bed.
A slightly lower value (550 euros for a simple one) for areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can save only if you move away in the peripheral areas:300 euros for one bed, and 450 for a simple one in the Predestina, Centocella or similar area.
In Naples, for a bed it takes 300/400 euros, for a simple one, it costs 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the areas Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, for bed, you have to count 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a simple one.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the urban economy.
Finally, the cities such as Perugia, where rentals are often taken by extra-Community students, have a subsequent anomaly: the rent requested to foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Goodbye to the old Paradiso cinema, the cities clear the historic halls.
Historic cinema rooms close up for the Multiplex.
"A city without cinema halls is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes"
The image offered by the performer Giuseppe Tornatore, well illustrates what is happening in the large Italian urban centres, but also in the provincial cities,
The process of marginalizing cinemas, with the birth of large multi-rooms, and the death of mono-room consumption in the central areas of the cities, is one of the major events that we find unmistakable and unmistakable; it also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear, it is often historical and memory-sponsored places, "It's like one of my friends was missing, someone we know, with whom we shared a lot of road and so many emotions," observes the director of the New Paradise Cinema, a film that offered to Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix of the jury of Cannes, and who told the poem of a provincial hall, and the nostalgia of a way of living the cinema, can be lost forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of traders, mean everything: these last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and these are the rooms of the main cities that paid the costs: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the areas most affected by the closure, Emilie Romaine is headed by 82 single rooms, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The proof that t is the first person responsible for their disappearance is the development of the multiplex, because these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-room cinemas: 195 screens in Lombardy over the past five years, 81 in Tuscany as well as in Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian exploitation has evolved irrationally," observes Paolo Protti, president of Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it should still ensure the survival of those who already exist, because when a firm room in a city, these frequencies are not necessarily ready to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention the lack of credit for traders: the state's previous debt is about EUR 10 million.
It is shameful that, ethically and morally, the Government does not comply with existing laws.
Supporting the sector would require between EUR 16 million and EUR 18 million per year.
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, concerned about these closures, has decided to resolve the situation by signing a protocol between Mary and Anec, the first of which in Italy, to defend and promote single cinemas in historic and peripheral centres.
The proposed regulations include tax facilities for mobile operators and benefits to the public: viewers will be able to enter the restricted traffic area, and will have special rates for parking and in certain parking spaces.
"This is an initiative that I am pleased to note," observes Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna putting in place other measures.
It is clear, however, that, in contrast to the superpower of multiplexes, traditional rooms also need to improve the quality of sound and image, since today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the SuperCinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Paradise Cinema" to which I have been thinking about for 10 years.
I've been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I've been in front of the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I've lived with so many shared emotions, I turn around from the other side to not see the black panels through the dust.
Links between politics and ‘andranheta, arrested Mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was prepared to uniform the Marie's choices in the interests of the Pyromalli clan."
heavy charges are launched by the magistrates of the Antimafia Branch of the Calabre, to the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for foreign competitions for mafia.
The cuffs also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his little lawyer son, a homonymist of the boss, already convicted of association of mafia-type villains, as well as paying 10 million euros.
"Affront to legal and moral regulations, and especially good sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay consultations to Master Piromalli.
"So it would have been granted to the clan - written by judges - to enter officially into the mayor's offices to facilitate, already considerable, the control and guidance of the public administration"
The chairman of the regional committee called Agazio Loiero, only hides "collusions between local committees and organised crime, there is more than one" in his region: "there are places where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the Andranheta, the heroes who are honest."
This morning's arrests followed those last July, after which the police announced that they had decapitated the Pyromalli clan.
By the end of April, the joint council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and always due to conditions assumed between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been discharged from their duty to administer the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of dissolution, was appointed head of a right-wing coalition after the May 2006 round.
He called the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the joint council.
He accused the vice-minister of the interior at the time, Marco Minniti, the accused of having manipulated everything for a political issue, but in view of the request for incarceration signed this morning, the judges explained that the Pyromalli clan had even succeeded in requesting a variation of the A3 project.
On the basis of the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the pms write, " the willingness to marry the demands of a business man, representing a more well-known group, near the Pyromalli, uniformizing the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan.
When the energy comes out of waves, the big ones are released.
This is an unmeasured settlement that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and now the large global energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, here are the new renewable sources on which colossians like Chevron have put their eyes, and now try to put their hands on them.
The opportunity to obtain energy from sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years now, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the environmental authorities and the new increase in oil give great impetus to the sector
The World Energy Council (WEC) of London estimated in 2007, that 15% of the world's electricity needs could be covered by offshore wind operating systems.
This quantity would be twice the amount produced by nuclear power plants.
And in addition, there would be currents and tides..
Colosseums on the attack.
The first company to launch on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build an installation in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, a real revolutionary would have been said.
Two years later, more and more candidates among these companies have always been dedicated to traditional energy put on marine energy.
"Shevron is currently studying technologies on ocean energy - she said the spokesperson of a company associated with the US oil collapse, the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal - and she assesses the opportunities to cooperate with us."
The cooperation in question relates to the obtaining of a permit by the US Energy Commission, which is necessary to give rise to a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if it is considered that just in Alaska, the Usa continue to extract oil, and President Bush recently set up a project for new excavations
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, which travels the way of energy coming from the sea, and the investments to date, although their details are not known, according to observers, indicate an increasing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are still talking about technology at the beginning, since marine energy does not spread fears about the environmental impact.
Currently, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small, and do not seem to create major problems in the ecosystem.
In order to produce large-scale energy, however, technologies must be used with a higher environmental impact.
"And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of bubbles connected to each other.
The push of the waves, which moves the balls upwards and downwards, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure is turning a turbine that, in turn, feeds a generator.
Energy is sent to the shore through cables under the sea.
For the moment, we have four such systems in the project phase, pending a single federal approval and a part of energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdan Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a commercial centre and parking using six turbines under the New York East River.
The movement of the water during the tides, turns the pitches of the turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant announced having a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to power.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they tell the Institute for the Research of Electricity, deserves the potential of sailors at this time.
Although this is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than the wind, the sun, or the waves, and is therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it's just on the energy of the seas that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, with others, are looking at the coast, have invested $7 million and half in 2008 and expect investments up to 35 million in 2009.
