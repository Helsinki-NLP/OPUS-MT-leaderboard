The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, signed the Act on Administrative Liability for Violations of Time and Order of Payment of Goods (Working, Services) in Procurement for Public and Municipal Needs.
This law is intended to address the very acute problem of failure to comply with its obligations by the contracting authorities in the conduct of public and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation where entrepreneurs were unable to receive payment under already implemented public and municipal contracts was widespread.
At that time, the President of Russia instructed the Office of the Prosecutor-General of the RF to take special control.
Because businessmen themselves were unable to deal with mistrustful clients who had entered into unfunded contracts, they tried to avoid paying commitments and included illegal terms in the treaties.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, 9.7 thousand submissions have been submitted by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office to protect businessmen ' s rights and, as a result of their review of disciplinary responsibility, 4.5 thousand officials have been brought to administrative level to 533, 75 cases have been brought before the investigative bodies for the organization of procedural checks, 46 of which have been prosecuted.
As a result, more than 66 billion rubles were owed to entrepreneurs.
As a result of the non-payment of multi-billion-billion contracts, these huge amounts have been accumulated.
Basic debt has resulted in numerous, systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs, where modest amounts have been found.
Here's the case.
The manager of the small company won a competition for several million rubles for social transport services.
The man invested all his negotiable assets, fully fulfilled his obligations, but did not receive the money in time.
The result is an increase in the financial debt of the employee, taxes, credit, which would have led to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur had not sought help from the prosecutor.
In a number of regions, the problem has now been maximized.
Nevertheless, as of the first half of 2017, the total debt incurred by prosecutors of the Russian Federation under public and municipal contracts amounted to some 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt rates continue to reach critical values, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office is working in a hand-held anti-crisis management mode.
The Attorney-General shall hold individual visits with local authorities, which shall deal with all violations committed by prosecutors and measures to eliminate them without delay.
Such operational meetings have already been held this year in Yaroslava and Ekaterinburg.
To improve the payment discipline of the public contractors, it would be possible to implement Federal Law No. 189-FZ " Amending the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation to establish the administrative responsibility of the contracting authorities for the violation of the time and order of payment of goods (work, services) in procurement for public and municipal needs", which the President of Russia signed last week.
The draft law had been developed by the Russian Mineconomie Development on the initiative of the Office of the Attorney-General.
The new law will supplement the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation, which provides for a fine of 30,000 to 50,000 rubles for a violation by an official of the time and order of payment of goods, works and services in public and municipal procurement.
If an official has already been subject to administrative punishment for a similar offence, he shall be disqualified for a period of one year to two years.
All prosecutors of the Russian Federation have already been commissioned to ensure the application of these legislative novelties in practice.
The Civil Rights Protection Group has announced a warning on the movement in Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of the Advancement of the Colorful Population has issued a warning for colouring people travelling to Missouri because of the discriminatory policies of the state and attacks on the racist soil.
The Group ' s statement reads: “The prevention for the Traveling National Associations of promoting the progress of the colourful population, effective until 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travellers, guests and citizens of the state of Missouri to be particularly careful and to exercise increased caution in state travel in connection with a number of suspected racist incidents that have occurred recently throughout the state and brought here.”
According to the National Association for the Promotion of the Progress of the Colorful Population, a warning on the movement of the group has led to a recent law adopted in Missouri, which has made it more difficult for people to win claims related to discrimination, and the fact that state law enforcement agencies often choose minority objects in a disproportionate manner.
“You people are being subjected to human rights violations.
They are stopped on the streets because of the colour of the skin, they are beaten and killed," said the Kansas City Star newspaper Rod Chapel, President of the National Association for the Promotion of the Progress of the Colorful People of Missouri.
“We hear complaints often as never before.”
This is the first warning of this kind announced by the United States.
The Panel referred to incidents such as the humiliation of black students on racial grounds at the University of Missouri and the death of a 20-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders was killed under suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he had finished gas while on his trip to the state and was arrested by the state police in Missouri without a charge of crime.
A recent report by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office of the State of Missouri also mentions the possibility of stopping on the road for black drivers by 75 per cent higher than for white drivers.
“The aim is to warn people to be aware of the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People must be prepared in such a way that they will take the money for the bet or inform their relatives that they travel on the territory of the State.”
According to the FBI's latest hate crime reporting programme, there were 100 hate crimes registered in Missouri in 2015, making it the sixteenth in the State in the number of such violations.
Movement warning is also a response to the new law of the state of Missouri, after which it will be more difficult to bring the case against the legal person in relation to housing or labour discrimination.
Earlier, the American Union for the Protection of Civil Liberties (ACLU) had announced warnings to travellers in Texas and Arizona after these states had adopted new immigration control laws that local law enforcement authorities were ordered to arrest people for violating immigration laws, which ACLU believed should increase the number of racial checks.
Traffic warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but public organizations have recently resorted to this in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people were killed as a result of a police patrol shot in Egypt
Unknown gunmen shot a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, Reuters reported referring to the Ministry of the Interior of Egypt.
During the shooting, two people, including one police officer, were killed, three were injured.
All the wounded were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car and then two armed men were found on the right-hand side of the fire.
One of the thugs was arrested, the other managed to hide.
Rosterism supports the law on the cancellation of free baggage for non-refundable aircraft
The Rostourism chapter of Oleg Safonov said in an interview with the RBC television channel that "positively" refers to the adoption of the law on the cancellation of free luggage in non-return aircraft.
"It is necessary to create conditions in which a person with no luggage can buy a ticket cheaply rather than a person with a luggage," he stressed.
Mr. Safonov noted, however, that, despite the fears of the citizens, it would not be necessary to pay for the carriage of the upper clothes and the mobile phone in hand bets.
"It would be right to calm down all our citizens and tourists and say that this is for the top clothes, for the sonic, for the mobile phone, for the iPad or even for any computer to have a relationship," said the chapter of Rosturism.
Former Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law providing for the right of airlines to rule on the free carriage of baggage by non-return aircraft.
It is that airlines themselves can determine the number of places and the weight of the baggage included in the non-refundable tariff.
Vladimir Putin commissioned the disposal of the bicycle pollution
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, at a meeting on the protection of the Baikala, reported that in recent years significant areas of the lake have been subjected to extreme pollution.
He had been instructed to identify sources of funding, plans and implements for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin has also commissioned the complete reforestation of the contaminated territories.
“We also need to deal with facilities that continue to work here, most of them have clean buildings,” says the President's RIA News.
He also added that the Office of the Prosecutor-General of Russia should carry out an environmental review.
According to him, there were problems in the lake area with natural landfills and a number of environmental violations by rest organizers.
"I want to stress this: not all the time to check, the measure must also be known here, but that is to say, illegal and environmentally harmful activities and appropriate measures," he stressed.
In the past, the Office of the Attorney General reported a reduction in the fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed an increase in the number of facilities under environmental supervision.
Recall, on 15 June, Vladimir Putin, in a direct line, stated the need to amend legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of the special security regime.
He was reported to the residents of the island of Olhon, which is part of the Baikal Natural Territory.
Sergey Donski, the Mint Nature Chapter, immediately suggested addressing the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the Baykal water protection area, but the Government of Buratia recalled that such changes were not sufficient, since the restrictions were linked to a number of regulatory acts.
In the Mineconomies, it had previously been proposed to solve the problem by amending the Land Code and the Environmental Protection Act.
A new temple will appear in the South
In the village of Kosovo, members of the community from the indigenous peoples of the north of Rachtinya, along with the inhabitants of the Berezov region, participate in the construction of the Orthodox temple in honor of the saint Nikolai Khudovertz.
Its location is the river bank, the temple will be well seen from far away, so it will serve as a way for the fishermen.
According to community representatives, the construction work will already be completed this year, the dome has now been established, and there are church bells.
The Gamer REB of the fleet provided transport escorts.
The temple is named after St. Nicholas the Miracle, for it is regarded as the Orthodox Church as the patron of passengers, including fishermen.
In Kosovo, the fish industry gives the settlers jobs and feeds them.
Locals are waiting when the temple opens its doors, and children even write about it in school discourses as a local note.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why do Singapore obey laws?
I'm talking to a local businessman, Chang, sitting in the open air breakfast room.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, the monkeys carefully make up an iron box from the office.
After the conversation is over, the businessman goes to the nearest urn, a hundred meters away, and throws the bull out there.
The penalty for waste in public places is $500, says Chang.
You know, I've just had a reflex since I was a kid: you can't throw a fantique out of a confectionery on a bridge right now.
And now it's all over the video camera.
And indeed, Singapore's sidewalks in the center of the city are clean, as is the museum.
Chang relates: Three months ago, his 18-year-old son carved out the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the man guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to death.
What?
Imagine yourself.
He got ten hits with a wooden stick on his jockeys and spent a week in prison.
We don't have any physical punishment.
As Singapore combines the highest standard of living and incredibly severe laws, the “Aif” screener was understood on the spot.
No one here intends to cancel the death penalty, says lawyer Victor Lee Hong.
Both the Euro Union and the United States have long felt that way.
If a person carries a large batch of drugs or trades them, he has a pendant.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi Airport, carrying 400 g of cocaine.
He was defended by the Australian Prime Minister, under threat of sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the pope of Rome.
However, the boy was still hanging.
After that, the drug addicts will take care of our country.
The point is this: Singapore believes that the laws are binding on all the people, not just the humble and the poor.
No matter who you are, you're a millionaire, a vice-premier, a famous artist or a euro union resident.
The only option in this case is, if you get a half-carcaine, you'll be hanging.
When you go to Singapore and you meet the dog signboards everywhere, you're just surprised how much a ban in this city!
For example, the sewing thread is sold only in the pharmacy, and it can be bought strictly on the prescription (!) of the doctor.
The tourist will not take the chewing gum when he comes, but it's time to put the belt in the subway, get a fine of $1,000 local.
In four days, I met two people with white plates on my neck, "I'm trashed."
Besides the fine, the leftovers are often referred to as a “referral in the yard” — cleaning parks and beaches for a week.
6 thousand dollars is paid by the “criminal” who forgets to wash the water in the public toilet, and when trying to handle the small need in the elevator of the home, a special detector is working on the door - blocking the door and sending a signal to the police.
Of all the exotic laws, the ban on the feeding of pigeons on the street, the public performance of songs and even the excessive flow of room vegetation (!): the water is considered to attract mosquitoes.
In order to avoid the fires of smokers, fires cannot be carried in the subway, otherwise they will be fined by 5,000 Singapore bucks.
In general, the idea is, whatever you do, you're gonna have to break something.
It's not like that, it's trying to convince me of Mohammed Kabir-Qajariya, the owner of the local tourist.
In particular, fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last twenty years I have not seen anyone attracted to their violation.
Why are they staying?
Don't let the citizens relax.
Compliance with the basic rules is closely monitored.
For example, if a minor is sold in a cigarette shop, he will be punished by the chain: the store owner will pay a huge sum, the offender himself will get hits by "the back" stick, and the seller will also be able to stand and put in prison.
It is because of the so severe laws of crime in Singapore that it is very rare.
Is that justified?
In the 1970 ’ s, there was chaos on the roads. Carmakers ignored lights, drove hotels, and got drunk.
After the fines were imposed, everything calmed down for a year.
Now the driver, drinking a lot of whiskey, knows that if they stop, the police won't let them go, they'll pay the price of the apartment and they'll go for years.
Many foreigners in South-East Asia seem to have a variety of conclaves.
In 1993, American writer William Gibson called Singapore “Disnelland with a death penalty” – American guests were terrified by the general wealth of residents, the “fearing clean airport” and the “cultural nature”.
Boarding, such things are unnatural, looks artificial, and should not in principle be.
The first days in Singapore, and you're really afraid to throw paper on the sidewalk, you're gonna get caught if you get on the subway with the frozen.
But then you get to the Little India area, and then the second is the pattern break: the bus stop is filled with plastic jars.
"How's that?" You're surprised.
That's right, the Singaporeans smile.
Everything's going on.
Not every such "crime" will be captured, but you must know that if you are counted, you will not get divorced, for you have violated the law.
Most often, it is enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, the power in Singapore is entirely authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnamese Hoshimin, I made a very cautious move, and motorcyclists often pick up smartphones and cameras from tourists.
In the centre of Paris full of dirty bombs and beggars.
Not everything on our streets, either, is trying to dump the garbage in the trash.
Singapore, however, has become the most peaceful, clean and safest city on earth as a result of the recruitment of dragon-like fines and cruel (including the death penalty) laws.
You're thinking.
Such human nature: Remember, and in Russia no one has been suing for the rule until they've been fined.
Although Singapore is not the main crime, it is voluntary law enforcement.
And it should be thought that we in Russia would also be happy to have clean streets, without a garbage in the subway, and welcome the arrest of those who ride an elevator with a public toilet.
Here's the body's punishment, thank you, no need.
The rest of Singapore's laws at least require supervision.
Nothing sacred?
Now the White House of Trump has focused on the Statue of Freedom.
The most reliable sign of the regime's change is when it begins to fight the statues.
Americans do not understand it worse than everyone else - from here the theater statue of Saddam Hussein on Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the government of Trump, no doubt knew what he had done when he had taken a symbolic blow to the Statue of Freedom during a fierce dispute with CNN journalist Jim Achosta on the President's proposals for a drastic reduction in legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't try on his own.
The thumbs of the owners of spaceships and artists representing the Statue of Liberty would have licked it if he had tried to do so.
But he tried for her, and especially for the meaning she was assigned in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed when the verses of Emma Lazarus were added to the Pedestal.
As Miller used to say to Acosta, "I don't want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that looks at peace.
The relief you are talking about was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Freedom.”
Miller correctly explained the facts, but as he himself said, it's really not about history.
This is about the current sound of the striking words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the State invites not any immigrants but the poorest: "Your constitutions, your poor people, / your crowds who dream of breathing freely, / The unfortunate wastes of your vast beaches."
The "unhappiness" has never been seen on our screens.
Miller didn't do literature - he made it clear that these people aren't waiting in America.
This issue of the meaning of the statue is part of the wider political and cultural war: it is indeed a question of the meaning of America.
Lazarus and her friends, who fought to put her words on a statue after her death, were very well aware of what they were doing.
The sculpture of the imagination was to mark the relationship between the French and American republics by means of a banner classic figure of the image of Freedom of Women.
Lazarus changed her mind: The female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she's got a completely different name: the mother of the outcasts.
The unity of poetry and image was a brilliant feminist movement and a devastating attack on American nativity.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the ones entitled to change it back.
The huge Rash Limbo, of his kind John the Baptist, who announced the arrival of Thramp in 2010, argued that Freedom does not invite anyone, rather it is an early neo-conservator carrying the American flame of the dark world: "Freedom is moving forward.
It is carrying a file of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The Fake doesn't need to light the way to the U.S.."
Limbo's habit really got in the way.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her, as she would have seen, unlucky, but full of people’s hopes on ships after a long and often heavy voyage.
This literally means to look at the world with the eyes of people who seek refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue is in answer to the words of hope and hospitality that they wish to hear.
And of course, that's not the perspective Miller and Trump will ever want to admit.
They don't need to light up the way, but to light up hatred, which is the only source of their strength.
2017 Peace Championship: Neil Blake appreciates the Scottish members of the British Assembly.
Elid Doyle remembers the time when there were only two Scottish people in Britain.
Neil Blake, director of the United Kingdom Light Athletics Federation, said that a 16-person Scottish part of the World Championship will contribute “significantly to the team”.
The record number of Scottish lightballs was selected for the 2017 London Championship starting on Friday.
Blake believes that in Scotland “something special is born” and the Federation of Light Athletics in the United Kingdom must take this into account.
"We know this and try to understand it and we will support it as long as they have the potential," Blake said.
"I spoke to people at the Scotland Sports Institute, and they think it's about what they did.
The Scottish Federation of Easy Athletics thinks that what they did should work.
The British Federation of Easy Athletics: What they did is work.
And people on the street think the same way.
I don't know why things got that way, but it's brighter."
Some of the Scottish light athletes claim medals, including Laura Moore and Andrew Bachert, who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at a distance of 5,000 m; and Elid Doyle has chosen his captain.
"Eylide's modest.
Her Captain's speech was great," says Blake.
"Many easy athletes, whether they are Scottish or not, and from where they live or train, have left this room, feeling proud and eager to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Elid had put into it were remarkable."
The winner of the Commonwealth Silver Medal, which will run 400 m away at its fifth World Championship with obstacles, says that 16 Scottishs in the British Congregation are "unbelievably".
The previous record of the number of Scottishs at the World Cup was equal to seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Laura Moore, who specializes in running at medium distances and who has been hit by five British and two European records last year.
She'll run for 1500 and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare, who will take part in the 1500m race, is another Scottish who has to pay attention to: behind him is a successful season in which there have been victories in the British Contests and the Annual Contests.
Doyle remembers his first world championship when, apart from her, the only Scottish in the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team says she is "incredibly proud" of the fact that so many of her compatriots have not only entered the rally, but in some cases they will claim medals and fight for the final.
"The captain of the assembly elects other members of the team, so in any case it was a great honor, but knowing that your friends voted for you and chose you -- it's a very special thing to me," she added.
"Finally, I'm very proud of all the Scottish people who went into the rally.
This shows how much we've accomplished.
And they're all the easy-to-do athletes who'll try to get to the post office.
What about my Captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was okay.
I just drew attention to the fact that we were very lucky to host the World Cup home.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from the sick and take advantage of what we're going to be at the Olympics again.
I got another chance to get out of his arena and participate in the competitions, and the atmosphere will be just amazing."
Blockage of Facebook critics: You should not go to public office if you are not willing to listen to voter criticism
The founder of our country understood that such a critical press was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but this did not prevent them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Of course, his criticism angered him.
But he did not hold back his criticism.
Because still in 1783, Washington said, "you can take away the freedom of speech and we, the deaf and the lame, will be led as sheep to battle."
Now I'm going to go to Governor Maryland Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Subordinate Hogan has blocked and lost at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his Facebook official page.
And this week, the American Union for the Protection of Civil Liberties put him in court for that.
The government's subordinates called this claim useless, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of "well and what."
"It's just Facebook," many will say.
But it's also important.
And this is especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He is an amazingly popular Republican governor in the democratic advantage of the state.
He is in second place in the approval rating of 50 governors of the country.
Hogan's not a super-reactor.
He demonstrated his strong hand in the administration of the State and his commitment to his principles.
It also uses Facebook as a primary way to communicate with its voters and with jokes on its page to demonstrate its leanness after head chemotherapy.
To block people who come on the Governor ' s page, which is declared as an official public forum and is run by taxpayers ' money administration, is therefore unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In a Washington Post interview, Amelia Ches, a press secretary, defended the governor's actions, claiming that blocking comments was simply their moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers and hackers who abuse the Internet.
Post spoke to some of the real people that Hogan had blocked.
And these are real people, not crazy, teachers, businessmen, pastors who address their elected leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, substantive and not harsh.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan as a Catholic.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarm Ramon of Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked for hate crimes.
“I wrote a strong comment that I was disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news”, she wrote in the section of comments to the article in Post.
"I also don't like the idea that when many people leave comments on the same subject, some immediately say it's a so-called coupe instead of admitting that they have a problem with a large group of unhappy citizens."
What the subordinate governors call a “concentrated spam attack”, others would probably call an “active life position”.
In the Facebook era, it is easy to edit your image simply by blocking criticism or by removing negative comments.
It is much less dusty than it was when people were required to send, collect and burn newspapers with critical advances or arrest and catch the mouth of the protestor.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just in the figure.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for refusing to listen to Facebook and other social media.
President Trampu was sued by Twitter users who were arrested in his Twitter account.
One of the first, reverse decisions on this subject was taken this week in Virginia.
According to a U.S. district judge from Alexandria, James K. Casheries, the president of the County Council of Laudon violated the First Amendment, threatening the voter in his Facebook account.
In Kentucky, the Republican Governor Matt Bevin submitted claims to the American Union for the protection of civil rights for his behaviour on Facebook and Twitter.
It's not that hard.
In Washington’s time, the available postal costs were about the same as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers grew fourfold, and the authors of the anonymous letters severely undermined its authority.
And even then Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People named Juricola, Valerius, Belizarius and Porcius wrote letters in newspapers that make Washington's decision laugh.
According to historical documents compiled by George Washington's online project documents, his office was seized by petitions criticizing his position under the Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Navigation.
But he didn't try to keep them quiet.
Freedom of speech, inconsistencies and statements are at the very heart of our State.
And true leadership means agreement with that.
Ronan Rafferti is looking forward to home amenities at the Renaissance Club
The former European champion Ronan Rafferti is looking forward to home amenities for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lotion will host the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for older athletes.
The Northern Ireland harvester, who led the neighborhood at the Archerfield Links Club, moved towards the final round last year until Paul Ils, attached to a new place and played the role of tournament representative on behalf of the founder and director of the Jerry Sarvadi Club.
“I saw how the Renaissance Club was built, and we see how it is successful with this event,” Rafferti said.
“The players will see this field at its best, it is in excellent condition.
Jerry did a great job setting up this place.
He's a fierce commitment to this game and he's proud of his achievements here.
This is an excellent demonstration for this field.”
Englishman Ills eagerly looks forward to the first time to holding up the championship title, despite the fact that he won his 32-year career in the European Tournament and in the European Challenge Tour.
“It’s a really special feeling,” said a player from Southport.
“I couldn’t try to win Extremadura Open again, because it was removed from the schedule year after I won it.
Returning to this corner of the world is magic.
It's a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year are coming back, and for me and my wife, Sharon, it was a special impression to win last year.
It was really a special time, and we will always remember it.”
Returns to the struggle on Gary Orr's homeland, which joined the European tournament for older athletes after 50 years of age.
This event will be the first public event in Scotland to be held in 2013 from the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
"When you play at home, it's always more important," said the resident of Helensboro Orr.
“You want to do well, but you feel this extra burden.”
I was very pleased to play again, and I showed a good golf course.
I am happy with what has been achieved so far.”
The three will be joined by the former winner of the Masters' tournament Ien Wusm and the champions of the senior sportsmen Paul Broderst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNally.
Orr and former Captain Ryder Cup Sam Torrance are two of the six Scottish people on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Steven Mcalister, Bill Longmuire and Ross Drummond.
Participation in the tournament is free of charge, and the parking lot costs 5 pounds per hour if one person is in the car, and 10 pounds if two or more people are in the car.
All income goes to the British prostate cancer fund.
British roads learn to absorb harmful emissions
Custom tunnels above highways capable of absorbing carbon dioxide emitted by cars are already being tested on the British roads.
The country ' s transport agency, according to the Autocar publication, reported positive results of the 100-metre tunnel test on one of the road signs in the north of the country.
The 6-metre tunnel is built of some new polymer materials that are able to absorb harmful substances contained in car exhausts.
However, the creation of a network of such tunnels is only part of the extensive measures that the UK authorities are about to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to tunnel networks, English will expand the network of charging stations for electric cars, undertake a number of road traffic reduction activities, expand commercial transport on electricity and modernize heavy-duty truck fleet.
According to official statistics, the fourth of all air pollution is due to transport and the unsatisfactory air quality is due to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Mosgorud changed the punishment of the disabled Mamayev to a fine
Mosgorud changed the sentence of disabled Anton Mamayev, sentenced to four and a half years in the colony, to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
This is reported by the TASS.
The prosecutor's office had previously asked the court to replace the sentence by explaining its request that Mamayeva's disease “prevented him from being in prison”.
28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years ' imprisonment with the sentence in the general regime for the defeat of his former Specialist.
On 19 July, the court released a man from custody at a departure meeting in SISO.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian “Golden Land”
Ready for lunch, Bardina Degei doesn't use the plate.
It's not even used as a broomstick.
In his wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Pania, in the southern Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually simply places a sweet potato, which is called the “note”, directly in the cellar.
Half an hour later, the hummingbird arrives and eats with impatient, unwashed hands.
Degey sits on the ground floor – she has no furniture – and this is where she does her work at home, such as the pouring of mud water from nearby mud.
The cleaning woman serves the stone in the room without a roof.
She was the youngest of four wives, so she was not assigned to work in the field.
There's a lot of people here.
Of course, working late may be dangerous: many men in this village are unemployed, many are drunk, and there are still soldiers.
“No one decides to walk around the village after five nights,” she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at everyday life in the highlands of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which had joined Indonesia in 1969 following a questionable referendum, when only 1026 elders had to vote publicly before the occupying armies.
The existing movement for independence from the Netherlands quickly turned its anger against the Government of Jakarta, which maintained strict control of the region, without allowing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, while the independent State of Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Eneratali is a city as far away as the abandoned one; the road here includes a half-hour flight from Jaapur, the administrative center of the province, in Nabire, and then a five-hour break on the rental car.
There's no public transport here.
The town, with a population of about 19,000, is made up of wooden houses covered with bamboo fences; the roofs are decorated with rust in various red shades.
There were few Indonesians, not journalists, and almost none of the foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the popes worshipped the god called Ug Tamae.
There have been other changes.
“It was unusual for us to wear this dress,” says Degei, showing his bright, saturbing hand, dark love and bright dress.
“We used to wear only sheets.”
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28 per cent of its population living below the poverty line, and the level of child mortality and literacy among the poor in Asia.
But it's still Indonesian gold.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by the Phoenix Freeport McMoran, is located in just 60 miles from Pania, a high-level province about 153,000 people living in New Jersey.
Only in 2015 did Freeport get gold and media here for about $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua can be accommodated by forest stocks valued at $78 billion.
These riches, however, bring one misfortune to the papayas, guaranteeing that the powerful armed forces of Indonesia remain here in a stifling presence.
According to New York Times, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local soldiers and units, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The demands of greater autonomy on the part of the popes threaten the existence of this gold.
According to human rights defenders, since 1969 more than 500,000 popes have been killed by the Indonesian military, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and deprived of their freedom.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass killings of the indigenous peoples of Papua highlands in the 1970s could be considered genocide.
Only last year Indonesia ' s police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We are losing everything”, the report published in 2016 by the Brisbane Epistle contains evidence of animals committed in the previous year, such as sentences without a court, torture – especially parts, as claimed in another report, rape and defeat of the electric current – and severe repression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims, because events take place every week,” says Andreas Harrison, who is researching Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The Hayki have slowed down, as Papua's resources have attracted the flow of immigrants from other regions of Indonesia.
The population of the province is 83 per cent of the population, but the population is changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Sulavesi.
The Javan puddles, the “warongs”, sell the hot chicken and the mixture of the fruit “gado-gado” given with peanut sauce.
Locals are trying to maintain competition.
“The migrants started selling chicken and fruit on the traditional market cheaper than the indigenous people of Papua,” explains Abet You, a twenty-four-year-old fruit farmer from Pania, who moved to Jaapur, the administrative center of the province, for work.
“This is why the indigenous people of Papua – the mother of Papua (women) – have lost their market.”
The President of Indonesia, Joco Vidodo, known among the people as Jocovi, vowed to address the inequality and violations of the rights in Papua during his presidential campaign in 2014.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former sailor was supported by 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Pania.
But there was almost nothing changed in Papua, and the local people felt loyal.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokovi, waiting for him to fulfill our hope of restoring justice,” says Jou.
In fact, only two months after the October inaugural by Jokovi Pania survived the tragedy.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children were on the streets and singing Christmas hymns at Enarotali’s castle, when two Indonesian soldiers were out of the dark on motorcycles.
Fearful children told them that they should turn on the lights.
According to local pastor Javed Tebay, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and came back with four soldiers after a while.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, the soldiers who were drunk pursued the children and used their rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot a group of children.
One child, sixteen-year-old Julianus Amo, was so severely beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone burned the nearby government building of the electoral commission, and the situation worsened the next day.
About a thousand Papuan men, women and children gathered in the football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting bows and filled up the Wita, a dance of the Papavian tribe of my pago: they ran around and imagined birds singing.
Some protestors began throwing stones at the police and military base.
When the situation worsened, internal radio soldiers were ordered: “If the crowd shows resistance more than three times, shoot them” – he sounded like the official document that saw the correspondents of TIME but was not published in local media.
Fifty - six - year - old Jeremias Kayame, head of the Kyo Koto district of Enarotali, felt a danger and called for peace, asking the crowd to break up their homes.
No one wanted to listen to him.
“When I came back, I suddenly got a bullet in my left arm,” he told TIME magazine, standing on the wing of his bright wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot, but he says the bullet flew by the sherengs of the assembled soldiers.
“There was a crowd, there was a lot of shootings,” he adds.
In the local village of Alphius, Job was struck three times, as told by his twin brother, who witnessed the shooting.
“I ran to him and looked at his body to make sure that he was there,” said Johannes, who, like many Indonesians, has only one name.
“I saw that he was dead... I kissed him.”
General Yotje Mende, chief police inspector of Papua, told reporters that his officers were only "protecting" their base because it was under attack.
“We need to be protected when people are threatening to kill us,” said Commissioner Pujo Sulistio, a police representative of Papua New Guinea in 2015.
“This is a matter of life and death”.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and much more injured.
The news of the murders reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokovi gave a speech in Jaapoura, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and adjourning to the issue of historical abuse by the authorities in Papua.
“I want this situation to be resolved immediately so that it will never be repeated in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, the Minister for Security, Viranto, said that he would establish a non-judicial organization to put an end to historical human rights violations.
But we're almost immediately responding.
“Most of the violations have occurred a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the nineties or early zeroes.
The thing is, of course, that we want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures to be followed," he said.
Viranto then gave up his words, speaking with TIME magazine in Jakarta on 5 June, and said he was not planning to establish an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
He said, “All will be judged by the judgement.”
Viranto, whom the United Nations accused of “crime against humanity” for the deaths of more than 1,000 people during the bloody vote for East Timor ' s independence in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua New Guinea had already been reported, including the incident in Panama.
The families of the victims from Pania met with such statements of utter distrust.
“For the last three years, I have been interrogated four times, but there has been absolutely no change,” says Johannes.
"I'm tired."
He says years later he's still living in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
“I am afraid that the soldiers will arrest me, I am afraid that they will shoot me.”
His brother James also expressed the view that the inhabitants of Pania were afraid to discuss the matter.
He said he was beaten by soldiers after he helped bury the four victims.
“After we buried the bodies, the soldiers followed me,” he says.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighborhood of Pania District of Deia.
During the clash between the forest dwellers and the construction company manager, who refused to help take a man who was unconscious to the hospital, one person and 17 others were injured, including children.
A man, twenty - four - year - old Ravianus Douv, who was drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested at the building site office belonging to the company.
According to the police, the villagers were throwing stones at officers who responded to the warning.
But locals claim that the mobile brigade (indonesian specialty) started shooting at the crowd and killed one person.
“We were in such a panic, we were afraid of revenge,” said the magazine TIME, a twenty-nine-year-old Domingu Badia, who lives next to the hospital and sees the wounded being rushed.
“I hid in my house for two days.”
Parliament demanded that the officers involved in the incident be heard and that the mobile police force withdraw from the region.
The lady has always been a sick spot for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of significant development is caused by the dissatisfaction of my tribes, monks, data and ladies scattered throughout the territory covered by the green central high mountain areas of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua Free Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of the popes by establishing a sporadic attack and affluence with kidnappings against Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
As a response in recent years, thousands of people in Pania have been arrested and unjustly detained by the military under the pretext of “protection of national independence”.
Some didn't come back.
The population of Papua Pania is considered “a sad, forgotten place”.
Poverty increases dissatisfaction.
The small portion of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is exactly the same as not available.
People here grow everything they eat: mainly notes, as well as some fruits and leaves.
Agriculture is women's work, each of which can be managed by four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually retain much of the family harvest, and the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten club notes cost only 10,000 Indonesian holes (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between indigenous papayas and new migrants have increased, which have reached large numbers since the introduction of new aircraft at Nabire Airport.
Few existing vacancies are usually provided to more educated and stable migrants.
Papuans rarely have enough money or skills to run their own competitive business.
“Young people don’t want to stay in the village... because there is no work or money here,” says John Gobay, president of the Pania tribal council.
Isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
In addition, restrictions on the work of international media remain harsh.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudy and Basil Lonshan were deported from Papua for “inadequacy with the organizations concerned” despite their rare permission to take the video.
According to Felim China, the Deputy Director of Asia, Human Rights Watch, the promises made during the Jokovi pre-election campaign to remove restrictions on media work in order to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
“At present, foreign journalists attempting to report from the southern eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and the West Papua, face new dangers: rejection of visas and inclusion in the blacklist,” he said.
Lack of attention by the press means that the international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is largely limited by the direct neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands — requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “diverse and widespread violations” in Papua New Guinea, including shooting in Panama.
The same countries in the past supported the OPM.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Arramanta Nasir, withdrew from the group's statement, telling reporters in Jakarta that “In Indonesia there is still a democratic system and free press, so it would be difficult to hide the testimony of episodes of human rights violations”.
Locals want more foreign Governments to focus on the situation.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the Dutch Human Rights Ambassador, Kissé Van Baara, visited Jaapur on 4 May, the local residents violated the silence, saying, “We want freedom”, according to the source, which was also present at the meeting, but wished to remain anonymous.
In Indonesia, new presidential elections will take place in 2019, but the Papuans say that they will hardly vote for Jokovi again.
“Jockovi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in a shooting in Pania,” says Gobai, president of the tribal council.
He wants Jokovi to know that the inhabitants of Pania, in addition to living in the shadow of the threat from the greedy army, are in poverty, and their education and health are in a bad condition.
Gobay says that the inhabitants of Pania, like other papayas, consider their voice dedicated to the Jocovi, the debt it should pay.
He says, "They don't need money. They just want justice."
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shooting in Pania carried out the last symbolic act of innocence: they buried the body of one of the victims on the ground directly opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice is likely never to be slandered, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget their sins.
“They killed a member of our family,” says James, without raising their heads.
"What else were we to do?"
Fire for the second time covers the Dubai skyscraper Fakel
The fire engulfed one of the world's tallest skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of people to leave the seventy-nine buildings in an emergency at a height of 337 feet.
It is already the second fire that has been on the high building, which is called Fakel, by coincidence, in two years.
The building had been evacuated, human victims were not reported, and there was no operational news about the cause of the fire.
“We slept and woke up from a fire alarm and people’s screams.
We ran down the staircase, and we needed about ten minutes to get down from the fiftieth floor," he told the Reuters resident of the skyscraper named George.
According to the Dubai City of Civil Defence, fire commanders set fire at about 4:00 a.m. (00:00 a.m. on Greenwich) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that it was working on providing asylum to the affected.
The event may return to the agenda to the security of materials used in outer high-rise buildings around the world.
During the investigation by the Fakela Administration after the fire, it was found in 2015 that the most affected was the posters – external panels used for design and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, the police claimed that the isolation system and the Grenfell-Tauer buildings in London could accelerate the spread of the fire that occurred there in June, killing about 80 people.
The growth of tourism flows in Ida-Virumaa in June has been minimal
According to the data received by the correspondent of the Rus.err.ee portal in the Department of Statistics, in June 2017 the services of the hotel enterprises in the north-east benefited a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists, which was 125 people or 0.6 per cent more than in the same period earlier.
At the same time, the number of local tourists has decreased and the number of foreigners has increased.
Yes, foreign tourism increased by 7.3 per cent (544 people) in June to 7994 tourists.
The number of local tourists decreased by 3.2 per cent from 12,944 to 12,525.
The number of Russian tourists in the region increased by 8.9% or 318 compared to June 2016.
In June 2017, Ida-Virumaa's hotel stayed for the night of 3885 guests from the RF.
Andrey Malachov gave the impression to the worshipers who were guilty of his abandonment
Andrey Malachov put his worshipers in Instagram, who are guilty of his departure from the "First" channel.
So far, he has not commented on any of the hearings, but today he has placed a fragment of the News article on 1 August.
Photo Malahov signed the tag "boss molocosos".
Article on how to prevent and focus on the worker ' s " burn " .
If you recall a number of reports that the leader was unable to find a common language with a newly arrived producer who had begun to reformat “Let us speak” it became clear what he had so clearly pointed out, the “CP” wrote.
Andrey Malachov, a television conductor, reportedly is currently on leave and has not signed a statement of dismissal from the First Channel.
The situation of dismissal may be clarified in the next few days.
Five soldiers were killed in an explosion in Afghanistan
At least five soldiers were killed in an explosion in the Afghan province of Gilmand, according to the RIA News.
According to the police, the grounded car was blown up next evening near the military checkpoint at Girishk's entrance.
About 20 people killed.
On Friday morning, a new C.P. took place in Girishke.
Armed criminals attacked the currency exchange point.
The shooting between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Diver took a video of his camera shark.
Diver and researcher Greg Skomal sealed on the video shark that tried his ex-camera GoPro.
The Rolek has posted on Facebook a U.S. Maritime Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, whose staff is Skomal.
The incident occurred on 2 August at the Cape Code coasts in the north-east of the United States, explains the Necn Portal.
During the underwater voyage, the man tried to take the shark off the camera he was holding on a special stick.
When a man noticed, an animal over three feet [3 m] in length came up to him.
The shark was trying to bite the camera, but it wasn't trying to attack the scientist.
Skomal explained that the thief had acted in such a way as to determine whether the girl was eating.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also noted that such behavior of the marine animal had proved to be a novelty for scientists.
A known cause of mass dragon in the Ural Military Centre
A working group of senior officers from the Central Military District to investigate the circumstances of the incident arrived at the Elan Training Centre, where the mass dragon occurred.
Some details of this plague have already been made known.
According to the public of Mash, who appeared on the page “VContact”, the contractors of the Ural military section number 31612 were brutally beaten because of unmanaged bed.
It all began with the fact that a number of people named Syan had deliberately ignored the officer ' s order to execute the beating.
Soldiers of the sixth round stood on the officer's side.
Saina supported the first speech.
In half an hour, 140 young men were smashed into a box of beds and raccoons, smashed the glass.
More than ten people were killed in the media.
The CWC rejected the information on the subsoil.
The study has shown that at least one fifth of U.S. passengers carry prohibited items on a plane.
The study has shown that more than 20 per cent of air passengers were knowingly or accidentally carried on board an aircraft through the United States Transport Safety Authority inspection points, including at least 6 per cent were loaded into an aircraft, despite having banned knives or other sharp objects.
Nearly 1 per cent reported that they later discovered that they had accidentally contained firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study conducted by Stratos Jet Charters, Inc., and involving more than 1,000 people, also showed that young passengers are more likely to violate the rules.
Of the respondents who acknowledged that they deliberately tried to fly from something forbidden by ATB, 19.7 per cent were millionaires compared with less than 15 per cent of X-generation members.
Conscious of the ATB staff, food and water are the most common.
More than 3 per cent were recognized as having been specifically tested by means of sharp objects, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents recognized that they had deliberately carried prohibited drugs.
The company stated that it had investigated passengers throughout the country to find out how many of them had accidentally been smuggled through airport inspections and how well they did.
It is expected that most often -- consciously or unconsciously -- they are blocking the smuggling through the investigation of those who fly the most.
According to the company, the ATB rules are quite complex and complicated.
People often do not know exactly what fluids they can carry and how much.
It is not surprising, therefore, that most of what ATB chooses are prohibited liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that ATB could consider it forbidden to carry a book.
Liquids are permitted on domestic voyages, but not on international voyages.
EPA Chapter Priuitt refuses to postpone the implementation of Obama's emission reduction rules
On the following day, following the request of 15 States, the head of the Environment Agency reversed its decision to postpone the implementation of the Obama regulations aimed at reducing emissions of pollutants from air pollution and the formation of smog.
Priuitt explained his decision that his agency now listened more to the needs of environmental regulators of individual states than in previous administrations.
He did not mention an action against his previous position before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute spread around the period of 1 October, to which the States were required to comply with the standards of 2015 on ground-level ozone.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay their compliance for one year to give his department more time to study the plan and to avoid “incompatibility with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth”.
Pruitt, who before President Trump was appointed to his current position as Attorney General of Oklahoma State, has long been known as a consistent opponent of the strengthening of environmental standards.
After moving to Washington, Preuitt repeatedly blocked or postponed the introduction of regulations that were contrary to the chemical or gas industry.
The unexpected change in the course on Wednesday was a regular legal defeat of the course taken by Poetry to return to the former norms.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the head of EPA had exceeded its powers by attempting to delay the implementation by Obama of the rules adopted by the Administration requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Priuitt suggested that, by radically changing the course on ozone standards, he had simply fulfilled the EPA ' s obligation to cooperate with States in the integrated process of timely implementation of new standards.
“The previous EPA administrations were often unable to put in place within the deadlines, then expected claims from groups of activists and others, and discussed the deadlines during the settlement of the case," said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen claims against EPA on his previous post.
"We do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings, and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously our statute and the authority that it gives us."
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt may at some point re-use his “delay powers and other authority data” to ensure that the “jcyjdfys” rules are clear and accessible.
The Republicans of Congress insist on a broader revision of the ozone regulations.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, seeks to postpone implementation of the 2015 rules to a minimum of eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this issue.
The Attorney General of New York, Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that filed a complaint this week against EPA, said that the group intended to continue the legal pressure.
“The changes in the EPA course – following our demands – are an important victory in the fight against health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans, who are directly affected by the power of their city,” Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the county of Colombia, joined the New York demand.
Earth-level ozone occurs when conventional pollutants from machinery, power plants, oil and chemical plants and other sources enter the atmosphere in a sunlight reaction.
This can cause serious respiratory problems in people who are sensitive to it, resulting in thousands of premature deaths a year.
Health and environmental defenders welcomed the unexpected change in Priuitt course.
"It's hard to think about how much pressure it took to achieve this completely logical step from the person who is charged with protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Bird from the Center of Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to resist the ideological campaign of the administration of Trump and protect those who pollute the air and their special interests."
The IAAF Congress extended the removal of the All-Russian Federation of Light Athletics
The Congress of the International Association of Small-Athlete Federations (IAAF) voted for the extension of the All-Russian Federation of Light Athletes (WFLA).
The Congress thus supported the IAF Council for the Restoration of the WFLA, which issued a report Monday, recommending that the removal be left to effect.
A total of 166 votes against 21 votes to the deleter.
The report of the IAF Board said that WFLA had made significant progress in achieving the conditions set by the Board of Rehabilitation, but those conditions had not yet been fully met.
Due to the disqualification of WFLA at the World Championship in London, Russian lightballs were forced to speak under a neutral flag.
There were 19 people admitted to the IAAF championship.
WFLA underwent an indefinite disqualification by IAAF in 2015.
At that time, the report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Fraud Agency (WADA) Dick Pounda was published, which referred to numerous violations of the WADA regulations authorized by Russian officials and sportsmen.
For more details on the last report of the IAAF Board, see the “U” item “IAAF extended sanctions against WFLA”.
Illicit defeat
Under the 3rd tour of the Russian Fonbet Championship, among the PFL teams, the new-Moscow "Hymik" took a trip against the FC "Kaluga".
Listening more than 10 days ago, the opponents played each other in the Russian cube, but this time the game was completely different.
"Chemic" didn't give up on the opponent, but the second weakness of the match led to the insulting goal and fiasco.
After the recent defeat of the kalujans with an account of 0:3 many had previously prophesied an easy victory for the hosts.
However, since the beginning of the meeting, the new mosqueers have been forced to consider themselves and to act in defence but in a position of force.
In 1 time, the swallows were more developed and benefited from the control of the ball.
Alexei Sirotin, a highly-quality match, has been held several times by dangerous hits and has assured partners of his actions.
Unfortunately, in the chemical attack, there was no effort or commitment to put the Kalugi defense in a dead end and kill the first target on the exit.
After the break, the game began to run on meeting lessons.
The newcomers were more active in the attack.
The alarming bells for our team have become defence errors that have allowed the nuns to create a number of sharp moments.
Ten minutes before the end of the meeting, the chemical seized the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of the kolujans played their role -- they did the finale more literally and coolly, giving up their moment to take the door.
After a dangerous attack, "Chemik" turned the ball into a corner, and the master's field was handed over without resistance to the gate.
The author was Yury Dubrovin.
At the report meeting, "Chimik" demonstrated a good game, but suffered a humiliating defeat.
Our team is still waiting for another departure - 11 August at 19 o'clock in Moscow at the Torpedo stadium named Eduardo Shootzov's newcomers will meet with the favorite FK Aarat FC group, which is composed of Roman Pavlučenko, Marat Izmailov, Igori Lebedenko, Alexei Rebko.
Come back to support "Chemic!"
The meeting place and time is 18.30 a.m. next to Magnolia store (East, etc.2).
Chemical composition: Sirotin, Monohin (k), Romance, Shayunov, Homutov, Gogiya (Oreshkin), Dodati, Rižov, St., Belanin (Adoevcev), Andreichenko (Ligin)

According to the disengagement of telephone conversations published, Trump pressed Mexico to pay the wall at the border
The Washington Post published the decryption of telephone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, during a telephone conversation with President of Mexico, Enrique Penney Neethey Trump insisted that he cease to state publicly that he will not pay for the planned wall at the border.
The President of the United States taunted him for publicly speaking against the wall, and said, according to the past information, “You can’t say that to the press”.
Trump began his pre-election campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern U.S. border and swore that he would make Mexico pay for the project.
The release of his first telephone conversation with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia also revealed a hot redeployment.
Trump told Ternbull that the agreement that the United States should accept refugees sent to Australia was “smiley,” “disgusting” and“ stupid”, and insisted that because of the agreement concluded by Obama administration, he would look like an idiot, as he intended to stop moving refugees to the United States.
Trump concluded the conversation, he told Turnbull that “it was the most unpleasant conversation of the day”.
The bodies killed in Abkhazia tourists flew from Sochi to Petersburg
A plane belonging to the Russian airline, on board of the bodies of the Russians killed in Abkhazia, who flew from Sochi to St. Petersburg at 20:15 in Moscow time, transmits the TASS.
At the end of the follow-up point, the board will meet ritual agency staff, as well as representatives of the city's Mary, as told journalists by the Deputy Minister for Curtains and Tourism Abkhazia Astamir Ahba.
The representatives of the Republic of the PRC previously stated that all the costs associated with the return of the body to Russia had been borne by the Government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to pay compensation to families that have lost 500 thousand rubles.
According to Ahba, Abkhazia ' s leadership was willing to pay the families of those killed as a result of the explosions of travel and residence in the Republic, but the family members only sent confidence in the right of local authorities to act in accordance with the established order.
On 2 August, at about 16:20 a.m. in Moscow, two explosions broke out in the village of Primorsk Gudaut, at the missile-artillery warehousing of the Ministry of Defence, after detonating large-scale weapons and other ammunition held there.
As a result, there was a burning of storage space that caused uncontrollable explosions of weapons of various modifications.
As a result, two Russian citizens, Elena Polakov, were killed in 1970 and Elena Timofee, born in 1962, who were at rest near the serological source.
64 persons, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, were brought to medical institutions in the Republic with various injuries.
There are currently seven people left in the station.
The study of Russian influence on American elections will be undertaken by a large jury
The Russian Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller convened a large jury in Washington to investigate Russia's influence on the U.S. Presidential elections in 2016, reports The Wall Street Journal and Reuters.
The main jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to interrogate witnesses under oath.
The collected materials will be examined by the Special Prosecutor and will decide whether they are sufficient for the prosecution.
Calling a large jury gives Muller additional credentials for the collection of testimony.
One of those investigations by the jury of jurors, which began work a few weeks ago, would then become the details of the son's meeting with President Donald Trump and Russian lawyer Natalie Veselnikka.
To verify the details of this meeting, held in June 2016, Muller had promised himself.
They're already researched by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump, the youngest, had expanded the status of his lawyers.
The tromp-younger had earlier said that he had been waiting for a compromise at the candidate's headquarters from the Hillary Clinton Democrat, but no disclosing documents had been presented, and the result was adoption.
In early August, a number of media reports revealed that the Tampa Younger's statement about the meeting with the Party had been literally dictated by the Tampo Elders.
In the White House it was stated that the President had not dictated anything but simply used his authority, which any father would do.
Deputy Mayor Penza has been detained at work.
The Deputy Head of Administration of Penza Irina Shiršin is detained for 48 hours at the request of the Investigative Committee at its workplace, reports RIA Novosti.
Official reports from law enforcement authorities have not yet been received, but the S.U.S. Press Service has assured that they will be followed soon.
In the Maria Penza there is no comment yet on what happened.
Irina Shirshina is one of the five vice-chairmen of the Penza Administration.
It has been promoting urban issues and land relations since April 2015.
Before that, she had worked as manager of the Gosjillstrückinspection in the Penzen area for a long time.
Irina Shirshina is raising three minor children, especially when she was a mother a year ago, she gave up her retirement and returned to work.
Of course, there's no cosmodrome or carrier rocket in Mexico.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space programme.
And the establishment of Yuri Gagarin's budget is a tribute to the first person who's been in space.
Unlike the memories of the Soviet period that exist in some countries, the memories of Gagarin, on the contrary, are “walking on the planet”.
In 2012, the monument was established in Houston, U.S.A., near the former NASA headquarters.
In London, a monument to the Royal Observatory was established in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first space flight.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in the city of Erfut, where our cosmonaut stayed in 1963.
The memorial in Karlovov Varah (Czech Republic) escaped in 1992 as a result of public protests and was transferred from the city centre to the square in front of the local airport.
In the 1970s, the memory of Yurius Gagarins appeared in Riga.
That's what the name and surname of the first cosmonaut sounds like in Latvian, and it looks like he's 70 years old.
Morse Ford's murder: Activists lose Lynch's courts on stage to call for justice
"Ford Mercury" in 1948 passed by the viewers in the village of Monroe in the state of Georgia, and with a rave he climbed to the small bridge of Morse Ford.
When a car with four black passengers and a white driver went to the bridge, a group of white men with roses crossed her path.
The chief, a middle - aged man in a thin strip, looked through the windshield.
Sitting inside was a terror.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" the man broke up.
"Get him out of the car!"
Pronouncers broke the silence when a young black man was pushed out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on 22 July, was only a scene.
But when Roger's neck was brushed down, almost all the viewers were actually breathing.
Since 2005, activists have returned to the Morse Ford Bridge to re-play that night when two black pairs, Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and May Murray Dorsey, were lynching in 1946.
No one was convicted of these murders.
"It's worth noting that in all these years no one has been arrested -- even though we see them next to us -- even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the settlement.
"It's Friday on our history and it's a stone on our souls."
A 71-year-old Brooks, a former member of the Congress of Georgia, who has been fighting for human rights for the rest of his life.
For him, it was a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the inhabitants of Monroe that injustice had not been corrected.
"We want investigations, we want completion, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need justice," he says.
"We can't go to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
The coroner covers the plain body of one of the lynching victims at Mors Ford on 27 July 1946.
According to the FBI, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighbouring counties were suspected of lynching.
But no one was charged.
Although the suspects for decades remained at liberty, human rights defenders said that the city was always well-known for its two related causes of lynching: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court ' s ruling for the first time allowed black citizens to vote in favour of the premierism to be held that summer.
About the same time during the same election, according to the FBI, the black traitor Roger Malcolm hit the dragon with the knife of Barnett Hester, a white landowner, apparently for the sake of women.
Brooks says that Hester slept with Malcolm Dorothy's wife, according to the city's rumors, and that the baby she had to give birth was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, Loy Harrison, a major white landowner, paid $600 to release Malcolm from prison on 25 July 1946.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they left the prison and drove to the Morse Ford Bridge, a mob of lynchers surrounded the car.
"It is argued that he organized and ordered the killings of Harrison," such a conclusion is made in one of the reports of the FBI.
"It is also clear that there has been an agreement between the state and city law enforcement authorities, who not only participated in the killings but also destroyed the evidence and hid the witnesses' identity."
Brooks calls it short.
"It was a test of election rights," he says.
"They've all been killed to send a black signal to the city. If you register and vote, it'll be the same with you."
For nearly ten years Cassandra Green is leading an annual show that reproduces the lynching at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Its performance is monitored, it captures the viewer and tells about the deep racism that many would like to see no more in America.
It's hard to see and turn away, but Green thinks it's important.
"We don't want to talk about Lynch's courts because they show us our own virtue," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't hear me or if you don't hear what I've been through."
This year’s performances began in June, and on the first day, almost 30 actors — dozens of whites, others blacks — gathered in the room and listened to a review of the play over the years.
Wade Marbo was a director with Green.
He has been a leading member of the clan for several years, but he says the role has not become easier.
"I think I'm out of my mind because it's not the man I am," says Marbo.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to come back at that time."
In the room of the actress Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
The show begins with Malcolm, upset by Hester sleeping with his wife, Dorothy, shouting and pushing him.
"I said, nigga, get out of my house!"
Rascon's screaming in response.
It's a blow.
And at the same time, all (at least all black actors) are affected by the hog.
Green laughs at the noise of everyone.
"What's that?" asked Ascona.
He's worried and upset.
Am I playing again?
"No," says Green in a laugh.
"I just don't think white people said "nigga" at the time."
"Yes," he laughs at one of the black performers.
"You've got to get a hard 'r'."
And so does energy change in the room: discomfort changes the sense of society.
Everyone has to do everything right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of the four killed.
The scene starts first.
This time, when Rascona speaks the word "n", it is clear and sharp.
No one laughs.
The show ends fast and fast.
Screaming, shooting, and then silence.
The woman in the sad black dress is standing over the bodies of the actors and playing the sad song Billy Holliday Strange Fruit.
Her voice is interrupted by words.
In hundreds of yards, half of the viewers tear out tears and sweat.
Among the viewers are almost equal in number to black and white.
One couple came from Itaki, New York, to see the presentation; many lived very close.
They were all almost eight hours patient with the heavy spirit of Georgia while Brooks led them to the cemetery of Malcolm and Dorsey.
So far, the killings have only been history, but now that they're standing in the same place where people were lynching, their ghosts seem to be floating in the air.
When the last note of the song is silenced, Green invites people to come closer and look at the body.
The children lean to their heads, cling to the beauty of the blood, and the still bodies, and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," was one little boy's fight, as if to remind himself of it.
A few minutes later Green thanks the viewers, and then it's over.
Actors tear the ropes off their necks and tear out their tears.
Bradshaw's got Marbo, the man in the suit who played the main doll.
Nick Raxcon's got two other actors and he's crying, he's falling in love with them: the emotional load of the show finally went down on him.
"All right" is a conversation of one of the women.
"We know you have a good heart.
You've got a reason for that."
Later, the viewers will sit down to dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta are livelyly discussing a black couple show they just met.
Deniza Daplinski finds words to describe how she feels after the show.
"It's hard to hear these horrible, bitter words and actions... people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that, I think the lynchings are still going on," she adds, "just now it's called the police shooting."
In the other corner of the room, Tyrone Brooks, who remembers his work as a human rights defender, took general attention.
He said he had already begun to plan a presentation next year.
"The stop inspires us, because it not only describes the horror of what we have survived, but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't learn from this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their history, and those who do not know their history, are destined to repeat it."
Court of Justice fined Naval for violations of the “aggravation sabbatical”
The Simeon court in Moscow fined Alexei Navalio for 300 thousand rubles for violating the order of the meeting.
The opponent was found guilty of an administrative offence provided for in art. 8, art. 20.2 of the COP RF “Re-infringement of the organization of the meeting”.
Earlier, Judge Hyzir Mussakaev of the Moscow Court of Simeon concluded his consideration of the administrative case with regard to Leonid Volkov, the head of opposition headquarters of Alexei Navali, who was responsible for the same article as Navali.
The wolves were found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300 thousand rubles.
In that amount, Judge Mussakaev assessed the distribution of the leaflets on the “agitation Saturday” held by the supporters of Navalio in Moscow from 8 to 9 July.
Having seen the agitmaterials that were followed by the subsidiaries, the police thought that the organizers had deliberately hidden its true public action (for which it was necessary to request prior authorization from the capital authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zdanov and Alexander Pomazuev applied for an end to administrative proceedings in connection with the absence of an offence and indicated that the police had made certain mistakes in the drafting of the protocol.
Volkova had not been detained in the “agitation substation” itself, but he had received an agenda that required him to appear at the police office to tell about the event with his active participation.
The same events were received by the Naval and another opponent, Nikolai Laskin.
In Mordovia, a gunman and three wedding guests were arrested
The court in Mordovia arrested a local resident who shot four people at the wedding, including a bride.

"Pirson" reduces another 3,000 jobs and reduces dividends to bring the business back to life
On Friday, the British Education Group of Pirson announced that it would reduce another 3,000 jobs and reduce the amount of preliminary dividends by 72 per cent as a result of the start of a regular restructuring programme aimed at combating the problems faced by their businesses.
These reductions in jobs, which, according to John Fillon's head of company, will mainly occur at the end of 2018 and early 2019, are added to the 4,000 jobs that have been reduced in previous restructuring.
Person announced that he was planning to reduce the cost of another $300 million (US$ 394 million) in May during the third cost reduction programme to try to return to the business, which had hit a fast transition to digital learning.

Attack on the convoy in Kabul: Private NATO killed as a result of the death bomb
According to information from official sources, the death bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and translators were injured, as reported in the NATO communication.
According to unverified local data, three civilians were also killed as a result of an incident in the urban area of Karabakh.
This explosion is the last one of those that hit Afghanistan this month of bloodshed: more than 30 people were killed on Tuesday as a result of an explosion in the mosque in Herata.
On Monday, a terrorist killed two people next to the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, the explosion that took place on Thursday evening occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked by a “transportable person with a separate explosive device”.
All wounded are reported to be in a stable condition and are treated at the U.S. military hospital at the Bagram airport.
Correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IGI) in Karabakh is a major source of concern to NATO forces located near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, and about 20 per cent of them were in the capital.
At the end of July, at least 30 people died in the Shia area of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had made an attack.
On 31 May, more than 150 people were killed as a result of a massive explosion in the city centre, the most serious number of human casualties since the United States forces removed the Taliban from power in 2001.
Violence accentuates the fragile situation in Afghanistan, while US President Donald Trump assesses whether there is a need to increase the number of U.S. military forces assisting troops and police in the country.
According to the correspondents, the attacks in Kabul, which have occurred in recent weeks, have also created a public confidence crisis with the Government, its conduct, and especially with regard to the reputation of President Ashraf Gani.
The Agency for the Protection of the Environment after Judicial Claims revokes the decision to postpone the adoption of the Air Pollution Act
The U.S. Environment Agency has reversed its decision to postpone the adoption of the Obama Age Act, whereby states should limit emissions of air pollution within the day after 15 states were brought to court for this step.
On Wednesday evening, the Environment Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called “zone measurements 2015”, stressing that this step demonstrates the Agency's willingness to cooperate with the states.
“We believe in dialogue with our partners in the states and their responsiveness,” said Scott Pruitt, Director of the Environment Agency.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the Environment Agency to postpone the measurements of ozone, where existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where it needs to be reduced to meet stricter air purity standards for one year until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, with the Federal District of Colombia, filed a claim claiming that the intention was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump is trying to reverse a wide range of environmental protection regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama, as part of a broader programme aimed, according to Trump, at brilliant economic growth.
However, action in this regard has led to resistance from democrats and environmental organizations concerned with the potential impact of large emissions on the health of the population.
On the Agency for the Environment, it is stated that the use of ozone-containing air can “deplete the function of the lungs and strengthen respiratory symptoms”, such as asthma.
The European Business Association took action against new anti-Russia sanctions
The European Business Association expressed disagreement with US economic sanctions against the RF.
In the view of AEB, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and the number of jobs.
The AEB statement states that business is one of the important linkages between countries and people, so the principles of free trade cannot be restricted.
The European business brings together more than 500 companies from the countries of the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the Heads of State and Government of the EU, the United States and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would enable them to separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in the spirit of peace and agreement.
Deputies ask the police to limit the movement on the coast in Pskov

The proud deputies of Constantine Bolotin, Gregory Partenkov and Valerie Lesnikov believe that cars prevent people from walking and resting in this place.
In their view, driver control will help to make this territory more peaceful and secure.
The problem is that the offenders ignore the signs of the "Walkway" and are free to travel on the coast.

According to the President, “it is necessary to delete the use of measures to prevent business activities, including the removal of hard drives from work computers and servers”.
Putin noted that if investigators have such a need, “it is enough to remove copies, trust them and use them during the investigation”.
The Head of State added that it was not possible to “create conditions that prevented the business from continuing until tax could be paid”.

British actor Robert Hardy's death
British actor Robert Hardy, who played as Minister of Magic Cornelius Fadja, screenplaying a series of novels about Harry Potter, died in the 92nd year of his life.
That's what the Independent newspaper reported on Thursday.
His relatives told him about the actor's death.
According to them, he lived “a great life with success in cinema, theatre and television for 70 years of his career”.
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort city of Cheltenham.
In 1959, at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre he played with Lawrence Olive at the Coriolan Tragedy.
Hardy also recalled the repeated role of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including in one of Agata Christi ' s screenplays about Miss Marple.

Robert Hardy also had to play the role of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt of the United States.
There was something going on in the Danish state: Prince Henryk, and in fact, Henry Mary Jane Andre, Count of Labord, refused to be buried with his fiancée, Queen Margaret.
This year, we have a "golden" wedding, but on the couple's agenda, it's not a celebration preparation, it's a potential dispute.
His Highness refused the title of the Prince Consort, and he joined the Queen, who never regretted the title of the Queen Consort.
Henrik lives in France, although he remains officially the wife of the Queen.
The Russian MlD called Washington to stop helmeting Moscow.
In the Russian MID, they responded to the statements of Mother Pensa, who accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans.
The relevant statement was circulated by the Foreign Affairs Office some time ago.
In his comments, the MIDI indicated that the United States was increasingly using cold war prints that were inadequate in modern realities.
In addition, the Russian diplomats called on the US authorities to stop the helm of the RF.
According to the "Arguments of the Week", the U.S. Vice President Mike Pens accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Western Balkans and organize a failed coup in Montenegro.
Mother Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time, talking about the possibility of a decisive single
Vasili Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who believe that they are constantly moving towards the most captivating boxing match of up to 147 pounds in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in ESPN's office rooms in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unbeatable champion in the easy weight of the World Boxing Council, went through the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization champion in the second long weight.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over the former world champion in four heavyweight categories, Erien Broner, on Saturday at the Showtime channel, both boxers are among the five best boxers regardless of the heavyweight categories.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck to you."
Lomachenko protects his belt in a single with Miguel Marriagioy on Saturday at seven o'clock at the ESPN channel.
When the boxers called for the photo, manager Lomachenko Egis Klimas noticed that a potential battle between them would be the same.
“I used to be in a slow weight,” Garcia reminded me.
“I went up to the category for Broner [up to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big anymore.
I'm a kid for 140.
I want to go down slowly.
And he has to climb to a slow [up to 135 pounds], and then we'll build a unit.
That's what the sick people want.
Let's get this over with."
That's what I'm saying.
"The box needs this unit."
Klimas asked whether the fight should be broadcast through the PPV service as part of a strategy which he believed Lomachenko was to carry out his debut struggle in weight 135 later this year to appoint for the next summer a meeting with Garcia (37-0.30 knockouts), which was also interested in fighting with the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their fight for the title of the World Cup in light weight at the Forum Arena on 23 September.
“He may be on the PPV because all the patients asked for it,” said Garcia, who later expressed his willingness to fight on the channel that would offer the best financial conditions.
“We are the main names.
No other names will be of such interest.
As soon as they are ready,
Garcia said that he considered Lomachenko a "shocking boxer" and might visit his Saturday unit.
But Lomachenko didn't immediately start praising Garcia, and he said that he thought the threeweight champion from Riverside looked “very slow, sorry, Mikey... you asked for a knockout.”
Garcia said he was focused on showing the force of the strike and then boxing.
They both said that they felt the tension rising in front of their own individual.
“This fight must take place.
No other fight provokes so much interest and conversation.
I'm more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for one of the boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
This is going to be a great fight.”

Putin ordered the G.A. to check the Baykal.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, commissioned the Office of the Prosecutor-General of the RF to carry out an inspection of the Territory of the Bike for the purpose of illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
“I ask the Genoqui Office to check the biking territory for facts of illegal and environmentally harmful activities”, said Vladimir Putin at a meeting on environmental development in the region.
In addition, the Russian leader requested that measures be taken if violations were detected.
New results of tests were published to assess the age of asylum seekers in Sweden
The latest results of the testing of asylum seekers in Sweden, which had undergone a new medical assessment of age, showed that more than 80 per cent of those protested had been assessed as persons over the age of 18, but not all believed that the results were accurate.
The Swedish National Judicial Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalwerket) began testing earlier this year.
They were designed to improve the assessment of age in the asylum process after the Swedish Migrationswerket had been criticised for not being able to determine the present age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
To date, Migrationswerket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the judicial agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests for the period from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent of those tested (2002) were assessed as persons 18 years of age or older, and in another 25 cases, the judicial agency assessed that the tested “probably 18 years of age or older”.
In 432 cases, the finding stated that a person “probably less than 18”.
Tests are carried out only when the age of the person raises doubts.
According to Johan Garanson of the Judicial Medicine Agency, the results were consistent with the results of the past few months.
“We don’t see a big difference with statistics last month, the numbers are exactly the same,” he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases where people were assessed as having reached the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum seekers were lying about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of the 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases “mostly 18 years of age or older”.
However, after considering 581 published results, the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases people openly stated that 18 were being fulfilled this year.
The method of medical evaluation of age in order to make X-rays of the teeth of wisdom and tomography of knee systems and to give them to dentists and X-rayologists has also caused criticism in some instances.
One of the skeptics is an endocrinologist at the Carolin Institute of Claude Marcus, whose work is to assess the biological maturity of people in order to determine whether they passed through sexual mutilation sooner or later than usual.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don’t think we need to use the methods of measurement that are being used right now.
The biological age is thus defined very precisely.
If we can't determine it with certainty, we don't have to do what we can," he said to the Metro newspaper.
However, Garansen of the Judicial Medicine Agency stated in favour of the accuracy of the tests: “In general, it can be said that the risk is mistaken to take a child as an adult.
We face the greatest risk when a person is about 18 years old, in which case he is about 10 per cent.”
I'm wondering if I'm going to go to the president's office.
During a working trip to Buratiu, Vladimir Putin wondered if he was willing to compete with the president of Russia in the 2018 elections, he said, "Interfax".
This statement was a response to the request of the inhabitants of the village of Ceremuschi Buryatski.
During the video conference on the elimination of the fire in Buratia and the Irkutian region, the interviewer addressed Putin with the words: “Vladimir Vladimirovic, we ask you: when the following presidential elections will take place, we all ask you to join this post again.”
"Well, I think, thank you," said the President in reply.
On 28 July, the Russian President's Press Secretary, Dmitry Peskov, commented on some media statements that the pre-election headquarters of Vladimir Putin would be headed by President Anton Weinno.
Sandov called these assumptions “nothing based on any hypothetical reasoning”.
"As long as there are no headquarters, until the establishment of headquarters is far away, until the election campaign is far away," said Sandkov.
"Until this is on the agenda," said Peskov.
The Governor of West Virginia said he's moving to another party.
The Governor of West Virginia, the representative of the Democratic Party, Jim Jastis, announced Thursday at a meeting with President Trump, which is moving to another party.
"You like it or not, but the Democrats have distanced themselves from me," said Governor Justis.
“Today I am speaking to you with many prayers and many thoughts... today I am speaking to you, people of the West Virgin: I can no longer be useful to you as a democratic governor.”
The meeting was bursting with applause.
"That's why I'm going to change my registration tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time to play a different game."
Previously, Trump had promised that an important statement would be made at the meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia with 42 per cent overhang, and Justice did not support the Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states because he inherited coal from his father.
Its status is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, on Thursday evening, the National Committee of the Republic Party issued a statement that “Governor Justice’s move to another party is another hit on the Democratic Party, which is more likely to interfere with what it is doing to make our country big again”.
“In view of all 15 governors and the control of the smallest number of state legislatures in history, the statement by Governor Justice is just another refusal from a party that has no leaders above the bottom and is unable to find a positive, unified message”, said CBS News, representative of the National Committee of the Republican Party Ron McDeniel.
Cot-tageloves at Mr. Krasavczyk's call found a house thanks to the soccess
The town of Pittsboro (North Carolina, U.S.A.) built a cat named Mr. Krasavčick weighing more than 20 pounds [14 kg] after becoming famous via the Internet.
That's what Mashable reports.
At the end of June, a photo of the cat was posted on Facebook in the account of the idiot, asking him to find his owner, because "he's probably been fed earlier."
In comments, users noted that the expression of the animal ' s morgue may become a new meme.
The publication received more than 3.2 thousand likes and 15,000 comments.
In comments, dozens of people expressed a desire to welcome Mr. Krasavčick.
As a result, he was given into the hands of Angela Frazee (Angela Frazee), who promised to take over his weight.
In an interview on the WNCN radio, the American reported that she had already had this experience: she took a cat home weighing about 10 kilograms, and now she has more than five.
In July, Reddit users drew attention to Australia’s tire basket with unusually long sleeves.
An animal photo post collected more than 68,000 reviews.
The commentators noted that she could make a career in the model business.
Kou praised Russia's “more honest” apology for the doping scandal
The international athlete Sebastian Kou praised on Thursday what he called a sincere apology from Russia for the doping scandal, but reiterated that it was now an inappropriate time to allow the country to participate in sports competitions again.
The Russian Federation ' s easy athletic representative, Dmitry Schlachtin, announced at the International Association of Small-Athlete Federations Congress that he had gone before the World Championship on Light-Athletes, that the removal of his country from sports competitions was fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all sportsmen in whom gold and silver medals were stolen in the competitions”.
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Small-Athlete Federations voted to retain the removal imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on evidence of the State-funded application of doping.
“I found that today’s response, today’s report was very sincere,” said the reporters to the President of the International Association of Small-Athlete Federations.
“The whole Council and Congress liked... that the Russian Federation itself acknowledged that it had been very hot times and is now doing everything possible to take care of the reorganization of the federation.”
Kou said that he had also “feeled” that Russia had agreed to the criteria for its restoration.
“I think it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission that it is not time to restore Russia to rights now,” Kou said.
“For the next few months, we have to do everything we can to deal with this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the fenced system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, meeting the strict criteria of the International Association of Small-Athlete Federations, will be neutral in the World Championship on Light-Athletes, which will start in London on Friday.
The Head of the Special Commission of the International Association of Light-Athlete Federations, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that a number of requirements still needed to be met to restore Russia.
As he had told reporters in London after a report by the International Association of Small-Athlete Federations Council, drug testing was still not done in sufficient volume, and the removed trainers were still doing their work peacefully.
The court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of oxysmosis
The detained Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) journalist Vasili Muravicki was arrested for two months, transferred to the SBU.
An Internet official named Gitomira is suspected of public change by posting his publications on Russian sites and in violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
Russia, however, did not support the measures of the Ukrainian authorities in relation to the journalist, considering this to be a “barbarian policy” against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided to undertake a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
Commander Borsini's patrol vessel entered Libya's territorial waters to then stop the flow of illegal migrants along with the country's VMS.
The decision to initiate the operation was adopted by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed with the internationally recognized Government of Libya, which does not control most of the country ' s territory.
The opposition cabinet and the Tobruk-based Libyan Parliament accused Italy of violating the sovereignty of Libya.
And the Commander of the Libyan National Army, Field Marshal Haftar, gave his subordinate command to oppose the Italian ships.
In Rome, however, it was stated that they did not believe these threats and intended to send another military vessel to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at the negotiations of Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of a recognised European Libyan Cabinet, Faiz Saraj.
The authorities of Italy went to establish a maritime mission to combat illegal migration after statistics on illegal immigrants from Libya were published in July: 95,000 since the beginning of the year.
In the Government, resources for the reception of migrants were exhausted.
A major failure occurred in Skype

Users began to complain to programme developers on Thursday, 3 August.
Microsoft stressed that specialists are already working actively to address the problems facing the people of Europe and North America, explains the RIA News.
Remember, in June this year, the work of Skype also failed.
Users could not receive and send messages for some time.
Two leaders of Ukraine's collection of light athletics have been removed from participation in the CM
Olga Zellak and Olsea Povch, specializing in the short distance run, are excluded from the collection of Ukraine for the 2017 World Cup in London.
This is reported on the Federation ' s Light Athletics (FLAU) website.
Such a decision was taken by an organization in connection with the establishment of the International Association of Small-Athlete Federations (IAAF) for Small-Athletes.
Coach Sergei Basenko is also excluded from the Ukrainian delegation.
According to Sportarena, IAAF suspects the use of doping.
Povx is the bronze prize of the 2012 Olympics and the 2011 World Cup, the 2010 European Championship at 4 to 100 metres, the Earth winner of the 2012 European Championship at 4 to 400 metres.
The World Championship on Light Athletics in London will take place from 4 to 13 August.
How the financial rules of football affect the transfer of Neimar to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unrestricted costs from European football clubs do not interfere with the world record of the transfer of Neimar from Barcelona to the French couple Saint-German.
No matter what the consequences may be, for the couple of Saint-German by UEFA, the leading body controlling European football, in which the authorities prohibit teams from taking part in the prestigious tournament of the League of Champions.
From the 2011 UEFA Financial Fireplace Regulations, it is clear that the GSP will eventually be shown that the transfer of Naimara was funded without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to free Brazil from the contract, and Naimar will receive a claim of tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of the transfer of Niemara to France.
The PSC can precisely be moved to hire Neimara and add it to the galaxy of other stars if it takes into account the financing of the team by the rich energy of the Qatari family.
Clubs have the right to spend large amounts on the acquisition of games, but they have to balance them with legitimate sources of income in order to achieve the threshold of profitability in their football business.
“FFP” introduced Michel Platini after his election as President of the UEFA in 2007.
The former French footballer believed that clubs that went into huge debt in their pursuit of success were essentially plundering and risking a breakdown if banks or owners stopped financing.
In 2011, FFP ceased to focus on clubs and instead turned to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model, originally used by Roman Abramovic in Chelsea in 2003, was to buy a club with good potential and then seriously spend to improve the team and create a world brand, became a difficult plan.
During the current three-year evaluation period, 2018, clubs may suffer losses of 30 million euros.
And despite Platinum's contempt for the presidential post in 2015, his successor to UEFA, Alexander Cheferin, is still determined to hold back excessive losses.
“Of course, FFP is alive, and we will step forward and strengthen the rules”, said Andrea Traverso, who controls FFP at UEFA last week.
Although the SG&A will pay for the purchase of the Nimar contract at the same time, it may distribute the amount for accounting purposes for the entire duration of its contract.
Nearmar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be shown in the annual accounts as costs of €44.4 million over the next five years.
During the first wave of the FFP sanctions in 2014, more severe sanctions were applied to the PSC as well as to the owned Abu-Dabi Manchester City.
A fine of 60 million euros was imposed (at the rate of 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and was ordered to limit the composition of its team to the League of Champions during the 2014-1015 season by 21 players instead of ordinary 25.
UEFA is tracking clubs that can try to rethink its financial inspections by diverting its income from the club ' s owners.
Even if the Qatari company could propose a “CIT”, but if the amount of funding was higher than the standard market prices, UEFA would not allow it to be regarded as a legitimate income.
That is exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the funding of the GSP was disbursed by the Qatar Tourist Office.
It was reported that part of Neimara ' s earnings in the GSP could be made in the form of payments from the 2022 World Peace Championship Organization Committee in Qatar.
But PZZ and Qatar-2022 deny that Neimar will be the ambassador of the world, and such a maneuver could easily detect UEFA inspectors.
The previous sanctions imposed on the PSC mean that UEFA will be more closely monitored by any attempt to circumvent the rules.
As reported on Thursday by those familiar with the situation, UEFA did not hold preliminary discussions with the PSC on the transfer of Neimar.
They contacted the Associated Press agency under the conditions of anonymity, as it was not authorized to discuss the provision of the PSC.
According to the latest published account, in 2015-1016, the GSP received more than 10 million euros in turnover of 542.4 million euros.
Accountancy for the last financial year has not yet been published.
“PES” expects that the arrival of Neimara will be a favourable ground for sponsoring transactions, the sale of adjuvants and football matches with the team logo.
The club is expected to grow by at least 30 per cent as a result of the new game.
No doubt upset by one of the best football players, the Spanish league tried to disrupt the transfer of Neimar, claiming that the “PES” would violate the financial “Fireplay”.
“This is an obvious case of “financial doping”, with the club and the state,” said Spanish newspaper “AS” President La Ligi Javier Tebas, bearing in mind that the ultimate owner of “PSZ” is Qatar.
Arsenala coach Arsen Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnet, shares La League's doubts about State funding.
“This is all the consequences of left participation, and this has completely changed the football landscape in the last fifteen years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“When the club belongs to the country, maybe everything.
It would be very difficult to comply with the financial platform, since the country could have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
Orders and venues of the oath will be determined by the President
Where and as the new Russian citizens will swear to the fidelity of the RF, the President will determine - such amendments to the second reading of the Act in question have been prepared by the Parliament Committee on Legislation and Ossuary.
A week ago, the MPs planned to define directly the procedure for the taking of an oath in the law.
From the birth of the solemn oath, children under the age of 18 will be released, as well as children under the age of 18 who are incapacitated, as amended by the amended draft Law on Nationality of the FU (at the disposal of the “Reports”), which the Committee will consider before the second reading at its meeting on 11 July.
The idea of taking an oath in return for formal signature of documents was supported by President Vladimir Putin on 6 June at a meeting with the speaker of Mr. Wiacheslav Volodin.
Members have formulated this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading of a bill that provides for the annulment of the decision to extradite nationality to those who have subsequently been convicted of a number of crimes of a terrorist or extremist nature: for example, public calls for terrorism or its public justification on the media or on the Internet (art. 2, art. 205.2, C.E. R.F.), as well as on aircraft, train or water transport, but only in the case of terrorism (art. 4, art. 211, C.E.R.F.).
According to the bill, its logic was: by making documents for citizenship, a person was signed under a promise to comply with Russian law - he stood up on the road to extremism, he violated that promise.
The bill was introduced in April by the leaders of the ruling groups Vladimir Vasiliev ("One Russia"), Gennady Zuganov (KPRF), Vladimir Girinovski (LDPR), Sergey Mironov ("Just Russia") and spokesperson for Mr. Wiacheslav Volodin.
On 19 May, the Members adopted it at first reading.
Last week, the DG Committee on Management and Legislation approved the text of the draft law for second reading, but has now been recast.
It now states that the procedure for taking an oath will be established by the President of the RF.
Earlier, parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the Law on Nationality of the FU, indicating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn setting before the State Herb and the flag of Russia in the presence of the representative of the IMF.
However, the text of the draft law did not make sense where such an event should take place - a list of places where the possible location of the RF herb could be regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, offices of the heads of the public authorities of the entities, municipal education, judges, prosecutors, heads of the federal executive authorities, etc.
Most likely, it could be the SAGS.
To make a solemn pledge to obtain the nationality of the RF will be after the officials have verified their documents.
But the Russian passport will only be received after the oath has been made, as the text has been prepared.
A week ago, the draft said that the oath should be prior to signing the order.
The updated text indicates that the Russian swearing will be 18 years old and not 14.
The rule under which the oath will be exempt would be incapacitated or limited, as well as those who cannot pronounce, read or sign the text of the oath on their own.
In addition, the President of the RF has the right to be released from this procedure and “other persons”,
The updated bill also provided for a special procedure for admission to Russian citizens of Ukraine, who are considered Russian-speaking.
They will have to formally withdraw from Ukrainian citizenship by making a statement to the competent authority of Ukraine.
A notary certified copy of the statement will have to be handed over to Russian officials.
Absence of “foreign” citizenship, as it is now, will not be necessary if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is not possible “because of reasons other than those of a person”.
The relevant amendment to the law was proposed by a group of MPs, including the first Deputy Speaker of DG Ivan Melnikov (KPRF), Natalie Poklonski, Pavel Krašinnikov and Irat Farrahov (the only Russian).
I think many of you know that getting a tip from Ukraine is not real, it's just impossible.
Consequently, very many people are waiting for their fate to be decided on the nationality of the RF, - explained the first chapter of the opinion committee on the management and legislation of Pavel Krašinnikov (ER).
In addition, the text made it clear that restrictions on the employment of certain posts for foreigners would not apply to those who had given up “second” nationality in writing and had submitted a former passport to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but “for reasons beyond its control” had not ceased to be regarded as a national of another country.
Foreigners are currently prohibited from occupying positions in the municipal service, being admitted to work on facilities and in organizations whose activities are related to the security of Russia.
Nor can a person with a dual nationality or a type of residence in another country become a Member of the House or a member of the Council of the Federation.
It is planned that the law should enter into force as from 1 September 2017 and the necessary legislative acts should be prepared at that time.
Nostalgia is becoming a niche in the hot American summer and the detective's truck
The present iteration of history is nostalgic at the same time about the famous days of characters in the 1980s; about the age of the grenade in the 1990s (about the time when the outstanding Masters David Wayne and Michael Schwalter made the "State" comedy for MTV); and about themselves, about 2001 before its stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poller and Paul Rad, turned to more serious things.
As a fact of culture, it is at the same time the exaltation and inauguration of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a Frenchman, she seems to be an anachronism.
The first day of the camp was a good surprise, and not just because of an absurdistic humor (including the original story about the speaking bank of a plant, which H. John Benjamin sounded).
The result is double the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually concerned children who have only reached adulthood; this makes it impossible to return to the joke.
"Ten years later," where adults have already played adults, has less deep emotional roots, and its parodity is more systematic and includes reefs from the rock movies of the 1990s, like "Hands that climb the cobble."
In one episode, the character gets Apple Powerbook, four-wheel roller horses, and "a bunch of other things since 1991".
There's a lot of things going on here.
The Good - Hearted Cup (Shoualter), now a writer, has not yet been able to reciprocate from Katie (Margerit Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not yet broken up with virginity.
And there's still a crazy and stupid conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (also Shoulter) who is now instigating George Bush-Old (the testing parody of Michael Jan Blake).
As always, the best part of Frenchmanship is a retreat from her.
It's particularly fun to see the eternal young Radda singing Matt Dillon's song from the "Oinochek," whose character, Andy's former great man, now looks like an old man.
This franchise could be successful by random madness in the spirit of the recursive Seven Up series, until it comes to its logical conclusion: "The Hot American Summer: twenty years later," where in the last stage the whole company would be in a movie at the movie "The Hot American Summer".
The "Deputy Charger" in the Amazon refers to another type of nostalgia: memories of the cold war from the Americans, the "Blonde Explosive" or even the "Blesca" with its images of the East and the West.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Riz Thomas, depicts a telefilm: the Romanian police drama of the 1980s, about two police officers in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Lenin road.
The main roles of Gregor and Joseph's idealist are Florin Pirsik the Younger and Cornelius Street, and their dialogues in the English language Chenning Tatum (the same executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's just an idea.
There are several visual jokes (policemen spend time watching a chess game, as Americans could watch football).
The team of well-known votes for staff -- including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershal Ali and Chloe Sevini -- is an interesting player in the "inventive vote".
But the "Deputy Charger" is so fond of the uninhibited propaganda drama -- there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask -- that it often looks like her.
Six long episodes are delayed and are not very and not often funny.
If it were to be done in a short time, the "Deputy Detective" could better deal with its satire in the spirit of the agitt prop; for example, whenever Gregor and Joseph come to the American embassy, two fat people sit in the lobby swallowing a bunch of hamburgers.
This image to the visualist-communist imagination tells us that Western culture is capable of doing whatever it takes to make a drink.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: we do so even with our own recent history, and with them.
The Russian SuperCubeship Football Championship Fund between Spartacus and Locomotive will amount to about 30 million rubles.
This was reported by the President of the Russian Football League (RFPL) to Sergei Pradkin at the press conference.
According to the RFPL chapter, the winner will receive 70% of that amount, according to RT.
He also added that so far the tickets for the match were almost gone.
The Spartan match will take place on Friday, July 14, at 21:30.
As TASS notes, Spartacus is an active RF champion and Locomotive is the owner of Cuba.
Two young fumes cleaned the furniture for 200 thousand rubles
During the days, a 37-year-old Uffimist with a furniture company came to the police.
The man said that he had stolen expensive tools from the brick, which had caused serious damage to his production.
The production of resins has become instruments of a total value of almost 200 thousand rubles: two heavy-duty machines, perforator, hydraulics, adhesives.
The guards began searching for criminals and soon went to the inhabitants of the Blahovesten district of Bascortostan, friends of 23 and 24 years old.
According to the media press report, communications penetrated the enterprise's territory, breached the entrance door, and issued tools.
Immediately after that, the guys sold the stolen technology to the first drop-in car service.
They are already involved in the theft and the rightholders have been able to return only part of the stolen instruments to the rightful owner.
The governor commented on Medvedev's words about the relationship between the RF and the United States
The United States of America and Russia should be able to work with each other.
This statement was made by the official representative of Mr. Hisser Neuert in response to the words of Prime Minister Dmitria Medvedev on the relations of two States.
Earlier, the head of the Russian Government had stated that, by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States had put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and had declared the RF a fully-fledged trade war.
In commenting on these words, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations are “low” but noted that “interoperability areas” need to be sought.
"Look at the peace in southwestern Syria, which has been observed for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia," says a diplomat from RIA Novosti.
However, the representative of the foreign political office refused to comment on the statement by the Russian Prime Minister that sanctions are equivalent to trade wars.
The bill on new sanctions for Russia, Iran and the United States President of the United States, Donald Trump, signed it last Wednesday.
He recognized, however, that the document was not successful and was contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior has grown roses from amethysts and quartz
The department of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - has completed the Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose collections.
They had five new wheels and three wheels on the bartenders.
Rose Dior Pré Catelan features two new rings and a tower of amethysts, pink quartz and brilliants made of gliptic technique (hand cutting on stone) and respect and 70-year-olds at home.
The Dior Joaillerie Victoria de Castellan was inspired by roses that grew in its place in Granville model Christian Dior, and the Paris Gardens of Bagatel and Pre-Catelan.
Trump found guilty of a deterioration in relations with Russia
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, expressed strong criticism of the members of the Congress.
In the opinion of the American leader, their actions have led to a deterioration in relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an unprecedented low and dangerous level.
"You can thank Congress, these same people can't even give us medicine," the president wrote on Twitter.
Before that, Donald Trump signed the new sanctions law against Russia, Iran and the PRC.
In particular, they will be affected by Russian banks and energy companies.
The White House subsequently circulated the President ' s statement that the law would not allow the United States to conclude profitable transactions and would further bring China and North Korea closer together.
Belarusian entrepreneur refused to buy a Ukrainian daughter Sberbanka
The entrepreneur from Belarus, Victor Prokopenja, withdrew an application from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) for the purchase of Sberbank's subsidiary.
The decision of the businessman explained the RBK’s intention “to focus on other of our planned investments and projects that we are working on”.
Mr. Prokopini said that such a step would become a “better investment in time”, despite the investment attractiveness of the purchase of Sberbank's daughter.
Mr. Prokopenia was the main claimant for the purchase of a Russian bank unit in Ukraine after the NGO rejected the request of the consortium of NorvikBank Grigorie Guselnik and of the Belarusian company Said Guceriev in July.
The Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after President Petr Poroshenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
One such financial organization, other than WTB and Non-Economic Bank, has become Sberbank.
Novak named the cause of the blackout in Crimea
In the Ministry of Energy, RF called the cause of blackout in Crimea.
Explained what had happened, the head of the delegation, Alexander Novak.
According to him, the peninsula remained powerless due to road and transport accidents in the territory of the Krasnodar Region.
The truck in the DTP hit the power transmission line and resulted in the exclusion of Cuban and related crimson networks.
The power failures of major Crimea cities were recorded last week.
Specialists have eliminated the flaws for several hours.
It was initially reported that the cause of blackout could have been an anomaly.
The Bank of England will maintain interest rates at 0.25%
It is expected that the Bank of England will later announce that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have led to possible increases.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain unsustainable and left interest rates unchanged among the growing pressure on family income.
Specialists of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted on 6 against 2 to maintain rates at 0.25%, with a lower number of committee members in that month for an increase in the rate, as weak economic growth had weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its projections to an increase of 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that family income pressure would continue, while it was still expected that inflation would rise to about 3% in the fall.
However, the bank had warned that increasing rates over the next few years would be necessary to control the inflation caused by the breezy, and had said that borrowing costs would probably have to be higher than expected in financial markets.
The members of the Committee also voted in favour of refusing to take part in a public set of measures to develop the economy launched a year ago due to the lack of flexibility.
As of February next, the bank will close the emergency financing plan for which it provides banks with low-cost loans, although it has announced that it is now due to provide up to £15 billion under the plan, up to £115 billion.
In the decision-making protocol on rates, the bank said: “In the main MPC forecasts, gross domestic product growth (GDP) remains slow in the near future, while the pressure on real family income continues to influence consumption.”
With regard to rates, he reiterated that, in order to stop inflation, “some financial policy would need to be stepped up” to “a little more” than expected by markets.
At this point, markets predict the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another increase in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all improvements would be “steps” and “restricted”.
The Bank's projections for the year and the following year are lower than those made in May, which amounted to 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The Bank left its forecast unchanged by 1.8 per cent in 2018.
After these news, the sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5 per cent to $1.31 and by 0.4 per cent to €1.11.
The decision not to change the rate was made after the recent negative growth rates had weakened the expected increase; GDP then increased by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter to 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to the representative of the bank, growth is expected to remain at the level of 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although there will be a slight increase at the end of the year.
The bank ' s last report on inflation has given little reason for the joy of households, which have been hit by high inflation and a very small increase in wages: according to the bank, the pressure will be increased before decreasing.
The Bank added that financial policy “can’t prevent” earnings in the next few years, but expects that “significant” wages will be restored by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also geared towards growth as a result of the growing demand for British goods resulting from a low rate of pound, which offsets part of the reduced consumption.
The decision was made a year after the rates had been reduced to 0.25 per cent in the past August following the shocking outcome of the referendum on exit from the Euro Union, which had resulted in a pound drop.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to fully influence prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its last decision at the rates, there was a rise in the noise around the expected rate increase, as inflation was increasingly pushing on and so on: three members of the committee were asked to increase rates to 0.5 per cent in July.
Last month inflation fell to 2.6% from 2.9% in July, although, according to the bank, the fall was expected and was recompensated in the coming months.
According to the Bank, the higher rate compared to the planned 2 per cent is entirely due to a low pound rate.
Andrew Montleik, director of Mortgage Brokers Coreco, said: “If we take into account the recent drop in the Soap rates, the mortgage market will probably become even more competitive again, as creditors require business opportunities and expect a good year’s end.
The market seems particularly favourable to those who are approaching the end of their existing contracts, as refinancing of loans often with the possibility of a lack of commission and at a low rate is becoming popular as never before.”
The Public Health Service will prescribe the challenge of HIV 10,000 people
As of September, patients will be given access to a “revolutionary” cure for HIV prevention after a battle in the High Court on the financing of a drug from the State Health Service.
The National Health Service of England announced that the pre-exposure HIV prevention (PREP), a pre-sex tablet that was proven to reduce the risk of infection in risk groups by an average of 86 per cent, would now be provided by the health service over the initial three-year trial period of approximately 10,000 people.
She agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal had supported the Supreme Court ' s ruling last year, which claimed that the National Health Service had the possibility to pay the PREP, despite its statement that it should be financed by the local authorities.
This step, which was announced on Thursday, was called “the most important innovation” by the president of the National Health Service of England, Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Authority (NAT) called it “a turning point”.
Prior to the full launch of the entire English programme by April 2018, Venereal Dispensers in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Cheffield will be one of the first to register people, and more Dispensers will join the programme in October.
Pre-exposure prevention (PREP) is a course of HIV medicines taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
According to research, the PREP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among those at risk.
When the PREP is given before sex in the human body, there is a sufficient number of specific medicines to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken every day or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients entitled to receive the medicinal product include homosexual and bisexual men, transgenders and people whose partners are HIV positive and who do not receive successful treatment.
Dispensers will select appropriate participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgenders and persons whose partners are unknown, whether their HIV status is restricted by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and assigned to a doctor of common practice in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest Venerological Dispenser participating in the program.
The programme will cost £10 million, and the National Health Service of England signed a pharmaceutical contract this week following an international tender.
The study is designed to assess all PREP options for the collection of clinical data on who is the target auditor of the medicinal product, its feasibility and its wide application.
“This key innovation should complement and strengthen the broader and more successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in combating one of the greatest health threats facing mankind.
Deborah Gold, President of NAT, said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
The PREP, if it is aimed literally at people in need of assistance and risk, allows for a change in the situation of the HIV epidemic in England.
As of September, people in the HIV risk group will be given access to a new open-ended tool that can be used by a person to control himself without discussing it with a partner, which will lead to the improvement of many lives.
We warmly welcome this news.”
Jan Green, President of the Terrence Higgins Fund, said: "Now, first of all, we need to make sure that the test is carried out quickly throughout the country and that none of the HIV risk groups are forgotten.
Now that we have the PREP experiment, we are going to protect more than 10,000 people in the HIV risk zone.”
Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Public Health, said: “We welcome the start of the PREP test, it has been very late due to months of delay and delay by the Government.”
Data show how revolutionary this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and the cessation of transmission of this disease.
This test will bring us closer to the full understanding of the advantages of the PREP.
It is now important that the test be conducted as soon as possible throughout the country to protect those at risk of HIV and to move us further towards ending the spread of HIV in society.
World Tatar Congress adopted resolution on the support of the Treaty of Tatarstan and Russia
The Sixth Meeting of the World Tatar Congress (WCT) adopted a resolution that highlighted the importance of maintaining the President ' s office in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is “a positively recommended form of organization of the Supreme State in the Republic and expressing the national interests of the entire Tatar people”.
In addition, the accession stressed in the resolution the importance of a treaty on the delimitation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, it “played a positive role in the ethnocultural, socio-economic and public political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole”.
It is recalled that since 24 July 2007, a treaty between Moscow and Kazan had been concluded for 10 years.
On 11 July, the representatives of the Gossovéta Tatarstan requested the President of Russia to extend the agreement and retain the appointment of the head of the region.
Tatarstan is now the only member of the Federation that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one known as the “Chairman”.
There were difficulties in obtaining international driving rights in Russia
The IBDAD units have a lack of international driving licences (IRUs).
In order to obtain such rights, it is necessary to wait a few weeks, which has become a problem for vacationers who want to take a vacation abroad on their car or take it there.
It should be noted that the situation with international driving licences remained contradictory.
MIU was introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what was written in the national certificate, as it explained the information in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are recorded in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but Russian rights are also recognized in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention.
However, everything depends on specific police or procuring offices: some require VAT and some have sufficient national rights.
In order to ensure that international law still prevails, it should be noted that in non-ratified countries (e.g., the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities are not entitled to recognize national rights or the IMF.
There is now a problem with forms in almost all IBDAD units, reports Commercial, conducting a study in a number of regions.
So, in Moscow, UGIBDD units are simply not issuing plates, the forms are not enough for four months.
You can sign up for a reception on the service website, but it's already been growing there by mid - August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is impossible to obtain “for technical reasons”, without including in detail that there are no forms in the Samar region, the same situation exists in other cities.
The problem has already been faced by many mosquitoes, and the following messages are becoming more and more common:
Irina Burmistrov: "Why can't international rights be obtained in Moscow?"
That's right, because all the GIBDD offices have completed the forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "Question to the people who know."
International rights must be acquired very urgently.
In Moscow, the talent is still far ahead, and the talent is not issued at all (the button is there, but the talent cannot be given).
The portal would have shown that in Spyb there is time free to eat.
Has anyone ever tried to get to another town?
Does it work?
As explained in the IMF, requirements for international driving licences have changed and new forms are being delivered in the Gosauto inspection unit.
This and may be related to the deficit, it is true that it is unclear what changes have not been reported in the past.
The forms are purchased by the Centre for Road Safety Special Designation (CSN BDD) of the MVD RF and then placed in the GIBDD units.
In recent years, all contracts were concluded with AO Goznak: in 2014-2015, almost 200 thousand forms were made, 15,000 forms were purchased in 2016, 90,000 in 2017, but the last contract was concluded with OOO “First Printed Court” for the manufacture of 70,000 forms.
There is a version that the CSN simply failed to conduct a tender in time, which led to a deficit.
However, there are other versions of the lack of forms: because of the crisis, many people began to travel on their own, not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries, China, Thailand and so on.
What rights there are, to the end, unclear, so people are being re-insuranced, so there has been a curious demand for international “steps”.
It has recently been known that professional drivers will have to pass an examination to confirm their qualifications.
Mintrans made such a proposal.
The International Driver Certificate (IMI) of the new model has been in force since 31 May 2011.
Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
Ukrainian Justice Minister Pavel Petrenko said he did not believe in Russia's ability to build a bridge in Crimea.
That's what he said on Friday, August 4, in an interview with the Watchman.
No respected international company will even put a bolt or hook there because it risks losing its business in the EU, the US, Japan, in countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia on Crimea.
"That is, in my view, there is actually no prospect of this project," Petrenko said.
He added that Russia considered it impossible to carry out a large infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot normally build smaller facilities.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, the entire stadium was already destroyed.
"Therefore, I believe that the best instrument in this situation is sanctions against companies that have become so unfavourable to join the project," said the officer.
On 31 July, the builders completed the construction of the Crimean Bridge.
On the Kerchen coast, the massive collection of the Crimean Bridge Road Ark was completed: it was closed at a height of 45 metres on the basis of the construction.
“At the same time, bridge builders have prepared a railway arc to be installed”, reported at the project information centre.
In April, the head of Mintrans Maxim Sokolov informed the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, that the construction of the facility was under way.
The Crimean Bridge unites the Crimean peninsula and the Krasnodar border.
In Spain, an officer who had not been in work for 10 years was fired
What angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) should the chief of the Spanish official Charles Recio have?
The permanent gap has grown for 10 long years.
However, Mr. Recio was fired.
But not his direct boss.
What is not going to happen in the world of bureaucrats.
The inhabitants seem to have long been accustomed to all the slums of "the people's servants".
Still, officials are always amazed at the tax - free lives of people.
This time, the "sensation" was sorry about Spain.
There, a member of the Valencian archives, Carles Recio, has been deadlocked for ten years.
At the same time, he received a regular complaint.
All solid is 50 thousand euros a year.
And here's Mr. Recio's weird times are over.
He was dismissed by the Valencian Legislative Assembly.
The investigation found that an angry walker had come to the office every morning at 07:00 to be seen in the electronic system.
And this is where I went home.
He came back to work at 4:00 so he could see again in the system that he left.
That's 10 years.
It was also known that all the leisure time a walker devoted to drawing comics at home.
The members of the Valencian Legislative Assembly now think how to punish Mr. Recio, who could not know how to work actively at his workplace his subordinate.
Judges propose protection from the Presidents
The Presidential Human Rights Council (HR) on behalf of Vladimir Putin has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The PSC proposes to limit the powers of the chairmen of the courts and to introduce their choice.
For the courts of appeal and cassation, the SPC would like to introduce special districts that would not be attached to the administrative and territorial division in the RF.
His proposals under the presidential mandate should also be submitted by the Supreme Court.
The HR has completed proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out by the HR on behalf of Vladimir Putin of 3 January 2017, who was given by the President after meeting with members of the Council.
The meeting with the members of the Council on 8 December 2016 discussed, among other things, individual cases of judicial arbitrariness, as well as issues of public control in places of detention (see “U” of 9 December).
A total of 25 proposals were made by the SPC to ensure the independence of judges and the detection of judicial errors, as well as the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlev human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the chairmen of the courts to enhance the independence of the other judges.
If the candidate for the post of judge has successfully completed the competition and has received the support of the judicial community, the President of the court shall, in the opinion of the HR, submit him for appointment without having the right to refuse as the law now permits.
It is also proposed to deprive the President of the right to allocate cases for consideration among judges.
To do this, experts admit, may have a specially written computer program.
It is also considered that the President is not entitled “to determine the results of the judge’s qualification assessment, to initiate his or her disciplinary responsibility, to decide on additional material payments”.
At the same time, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move to “the election of the Presidents of the Courts by themselves” and “entrust them with their powers for a relatively short period of time with compulsory rotation”.
All the Presidents of the Courts (from the Republic to the Districts) are now appointed for six years as President of the Supreme Court of the RF.
In order to protect judges from pressure from regional administrations, the SPC proposes to re-organize appeals and cases in courts of general jurisdiction.
Their structure is now linked to an administrative and territorial division in the RF.
In the CHC, it is said that “it is necessary to ensure that individual courts of appeal and cassation are organized not at the level of the regional judicial authorities in the entities of the RF, but in the judicial districts”.
Experts take the case of arbitral tribunals as a basis.
There are “judgment districts” that do not correspond to the administrative division in the RF, but thereby guarantee a high degree of independence from regional officials who are hampered by the use of “phone law”.
The World Judges of the HC propose to strengthen the people ' s leaders to consider, with their participation, some “civil and administrative” categories.
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, the restoration of work, the protection of honour and dignity, the deprivation of driving rights, etc.
"That's just our proposals," explained "U" member of the HR, judge of the Constitutional Court in the resignation of Tamar Morštkov.
She also recalled that the President ' s mandate was not only to the PSC, but also to the Supreme Court (VC), which had not yet disclosed its proposals.
There is still time for the execution of the mandate of the HR (with the Executive Director-General and the Human Rights Commissioner).
To report to Vladimir Putin on the effectiveness of justice independence in the RF, the President of VS Wiacheslav Lebedev must be present by 1 September.
Living a high life: Semitage and clever designers have turned this small apartment into a spacious apartment in Earls Court
Joan Lee, a former banker who was involved in real estate repair, moved from a spacious house in Nightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of a nice model house in Queen Anna’s style, and in favor of a new design, Joan says she has not collected her things and has not moved again.
“I used to live with my ex at Nightsbridge in a much bigger place,” says Joan.
“I was looking for something comparable to my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and there were the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered her the same day.
Since the first survey, the apartment has been completely rebuilt at 1,000 square feet.
Originally, it was a one-bedroom apartment with a complicated plan – to get into the bedroom, it had to go through the kitchen – and Joanne wanted to add space to store things and half-beds to make the most of the generous benefits.
“I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of lights.
That's what my demands were," she says.
To this end, she hired Erfan Azadi from the notting Hill architectural and design studio Duck & Shed to use a 1.5-foot roof and create a home that would not only be a successful project but would be acceptable to Joan.
The flood was not high enough to build two spaces above each other, so the architectural task was to create a semi-tage where full growth could be achieved.
Erfan had to think creatively to deal with the briefing.
“Working with permanent structures is very difficult”, he explains.
“We needed to place the rooms so that they were above each other, and we didn’t have to move.
It wasn’t just to build a simple platform, but to light up the structures so that they could be at the right height and allow space to be used up and down.”
This decision allowed Erfan to build two full-sized rooms above each other in the remote area – and still very interesting.
From the semi-tage through the vintage copper light window from Retrovius, there is a view of a spacious guest at the bottom.
The gold-plated mirror furniture, silver accents and lighting devices from Serge Muya are used to design the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding visibility, space and light.
The short corridor is framed by mirrors to make it look longer.
The mirror panel on the kitchen looks like a window in another room.
The mirror cabinets are at the entrance to store Joan's entire vessel.
In order to create a sense of brighter space, the beauty of the hotel can be cultivated by the kitchen when it is not used.
There's nothing new in the kitchens.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it moves up the door like in the garage.
“Technical art has been used here,” Erfan will tell us about the armored steel of the wooden-voltage shield door.
“It is equipped with an anti-weight, so when you press the door up, it is very easy.”
Because of the reasonable use of space and storage space, Joan received an additional 16 square metres, an additional bedroom and improved planning.
“At the end of the day, sex is what you’re going to sell, that is, what your real estate is valued for,” says Erfan.
“A real estate agent will come in and make calculations based on gender. ”
Here they have been able to expand the sex area by using quality materials that add light to the space.
“Materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional relationship with the home,” Erfan says.
“No one loves the electric power station in the walls.
It's important, but it doesn't hit the strings of our hearts."
This is proof that a good design and an increased apartment meter can turn out of something normal to be something amazing.
Actually, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
Government approved the establishment of a commission on cultural policy
The Government of Russia approved the establishment of a commission on public cultural policy.
The relevant decision is published on the Government website.
According to the document, the Commission's main task will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to cultural policy.
The Commission will also develop draft cultural policy strategies, clarify the objectives and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
The Head of the Commission is appointed Vice-President of the Government of the RF.
The composition of the Commission will be approved separately.
Prime Minister RF Dmitry Medvedev approved in 2016 a plan for the implementation of a public cultural policy strategy by 2030.
The plan includes 193 activities and includes measures to increase the influence of Russian culture in other countries, to preserve a single cultural area and cultural heritage, and will also contribute to creating conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in G20 countries decreased to a minimum of eight years
Consumer prices in G20 countries have decreased to a minimum in the last eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal, referring to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
The OECD estimates that in June 2016 inflation rates were 2 per cent lower in October 2009, when the price rise index reached 1.7 per cent.
Russia had previously reported a 0.1 per cent reduction in the consumer price index.
Thus, the agency recorded the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The inflation target in Russia, according to Minfin, is 4.1 per cent.
Minieconomies, however, believe that the target has already been achieved - in this department ' s version, the figure is 4 per cent.
Putin warns against the illegal cutting of the bike tag
Russian leader Vladimir Putin warned of the illegal destruction of forests during the meeting on environmental development in the natural biking area.
In the course of the event, the Minister of Natural Resources Sergei Donsky noted that a bill had been prepared before.
It authorizes the logging of the forest during the fires, and the Government plans to adopt it in the autumn.
In turn, the President said that the project should be monitored to ensure that “not all order has been cut off” during the cutting process.
Donsk noted that the bill was subject to supervision by the PMC and the supervisory authorities.
Media: U.S. soldiers secretly negotiate with the Colonels of Donbass
There is a regular telephone connection in Donbasse due to the armed resistance.
Fighters of the opposing parties regularly communicate with each other on mobile phones, and they do not know about this at headquarters.
The U.S.U. and the Donbass militia have made hundreds of phone calls a secret from their high command.
On 4 August, "Trana.ua" reported referring to the parties to the military operation in Donbass.
The team commanders are well aware of the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them by telephone every day.
Communication is not at all domestic: the commanders are trying to reach some “tactic arrangements”.
Such discussions often lead to reconciliation at a certain front.
Journalists were aware of cases when congratulations on the birthday were received by an officer on the front line from his formal enemy.
The WSU and the DNR and LNR troops are on the verge of demarcation from the spring of 2014, when Ukraine launched a military operation against Donbass.
MID has hampered the blocking of UNSB statements of attacks on the Embassy of the F.R.
The Russian Foreign Affairs Office is repudiated by the actions of certain Western diplomatic representatives who block UN Sobeza ' s statements in the press condemning the terrorist attacks of the Embassy of the Russian Federation.
This is reported by the Russian MID.
It was recalled that the Russian Embassy's territory in Damascus on 2 August was shot three times a month by terrorists from the Heyat Tahrir Ash-Sham (formerly "Jabhat an Nusra " prohibited in RF) and "Filek Ar-Rahman".
Bearing in mind that the international community unanimously qualified Nusra as a terrorist organization, and UNSCRs called for countering this structure, the MIDI RF noted that “it would appear, of course, that Nusra's acts should be met with total unconditional and firm condemnation and that no ambiguity should be required in the evaluation of the outcome against diplomatic missions.”
However, as emphasized in the diplomacy, “for the third time a month, the diplomatic representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Ukraine in the UN Security Council have, inter alia, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard draft short statement by the Security Council to condemn the terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital.”
The unwillingness to show diplomatic solidarity with us remains the conscience of these delegations.
“The most disturbing thing is that the inability of the Security Council to condemn terrorist acts encourages them to new provocations and acts of terrorism, gives them a sense of impunity,” they said in MIDI and added that “these barbarians do not want to be convinced that someone in the Security Council is with them.”
Vladimir Putin made a statement limiting the number of out-of-the-art business checks
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, at the Far East Investment Project Meeting, said that the number of out-of-the-art inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30 per cent of the planned number, as well as the need to limit the time limit for inspections to ten days.
“Exploration is usually carried out without agreement with the Public Prosecutor’s Office; only 2-3 per cent is in agreement with the Public Prosecutor’s Office; everything else is going on its own,” says the president of the TASS.
Vladimir Putin also said that it was necessary to prohibit investigators from downloading servers and hard drives from businesses.
In addition, the President considered that business associations should have the right to protect the interests of their members in court.
“This, I hope, will give a certain perspective on business-related or business-related matters,” said the head of State.
As reported by “U”, the moratorium on planning checks is increasing the number of other types of inspections by entrepreneurs.
In May, at the request of the business ombudsman, a survey was conducted with President Boris Titov, which found that there had actually been a replacement of planned out-of-the-art checks (the proportion of those who encountered them grew from 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016), prosecutors (from 16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent), judges (from 7.9 per cent to 13.3 per cent) and civil statements (from 15 per cent to 19.5 per cent) and administrative investigations (10.8 per cent to 15.5 per cent).
More details about the business checks in the "U" material "to the small business have gone on the other side".
Brothers fight for the real estate of more than $500 million
Two brothers fought for one of the largest empires in the state of Victoria for more than $500 million in real estate - forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
The former director of the Carlton Football Club and the founder of Colin de Lutis live in the Turkish Palace through three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed a claim against him in the Supreme Court for division of ownership and assets.
Paul wants to get out of his family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court is still dealing with a heated divorce dispute.
Along with their mother, Anna, the brothers hold 87 objects worth more than half a billion dollars purchased since their family bought a shop on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a network of 160 trading points.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
Money has been invested in real estate, and the De Lutis family has today included office buildings, building sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, Gold Beach and Mount Buller and shopping centers in suburbs.
According to agreement with the late father, Colin, whose Paul describes as "the main driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family, owns about two thirds of the company's assets, and Paul owns about one third.
According to the court, this means that Colina's property is 316 million and Paula is 176 million.
The division of property and money became a stumbling block for Paul.
"The division proposed by Colin gives him, in my view, the best parts of property," he wrote in his first demonstrations in 2015.
The first hearings in the Supreme Court were held last Friday after several unsuccessful attempts to reconcile.
The brothers will now dispute who will control the existing business, from which Paul said Colin expelled him.
Colin claims that this is not the case, but charges Paul with mismanaging some of the facilities.
In the evidence given by Colin at the beginning of the process, he said he was hoping for a settlement of the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me consider my family a top priority," he wrote.
Trial costs are growing as a snowcoma: hundreds of pages of testimony, e-mail and company records such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer have been added to the case; both parties have attracted the most famous lawyers, including Queen's lawyer Allan Mayers, and the best rapists.
Ms. De Lutis and her late wife, Luigi, were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s they managed milk bars and gastronomy and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a shop in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family store of the gins.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "in the last classes of school and Paul was a boy (about 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis says that they and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to transfer their possession to their sons without conflict.
"Luji often told me she didn't want the brothers to get to trial," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group; Colina says that Mark got 10 million when he left the business and Luke got 26 million.
According to Paul, and Luke, and Mark were “unsatisfied with the financial conditions of their office”.
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the Board of Directors of the AFL Club and, according to Eddie McGir's 2015 biography, a best friend of the star.
On Friday, Ferfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers.
He answered only Colin, a text message saying that, since the case had not yet been examined in court, “I really have nothing to say”.
"I am very sorry that my brother Paul decided to file a complaint against me and to bring the name of our family to court," he wrote.
In mid - 2016, Colin wrote in proof that he had tried to meet his brother’s demands.
"Our father would not like to see Paul and I argue in court," he said, adding that "there is still hope for a solution to the conflict."
On Friday, this hope seemed to have spread.
"The decision on our case will soon be handed down by the court," Colin wrote.
The new head of the trampa machine plans to limit the arrival of information to the President.
Others have tried to do so and have suffered defeat.
Maybe John F. Kelly will really make it.
Then he'll be the first.
"Politics" reports that the new head of the White House machine plans to limit the flow of information from President Tramp, including news from the media, to keep the boss in a calmer state.
That's what reporter Josh Dozzy reports.
"At a meeting held by the new head of the White House, John F. Kelly, with the head of the machine on his first working day, he identified the main problem in the White House with President Donald Trump, whom he hopes to resolve: bad channels of information coming to the President."
Kelly told the staff that the information should be passed through it - in paper form or by briefings - because the President would be better able to make decisions if he received the correct information.
Kelly's diagnosis is completely true, but others have already failed trying to humiliate Trump by tracking his inputs.
President Trump's relations with television were set up a few decades ago - and now that he is in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
"When Trump, as a candidate, was opposed to unfair lighting of the campaign, it was useful to demonstrate to him that he had received fair lighting in the publications that could be persuaded," said Sam Nanberg, a former electoral councillor in February.
Tara Palmeri then wrote in "Policy," that "as said by the six former members of the electoral staff to keep Tramp's habit of writing on Twitter, it was necessary to ensure that the information received to him was a constant stream of praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Tramp's habit of writing on Twitter was once under control is just ridiculous.
Perhaps these members of the electoral staff know something that we don't know, for example, that if they didn't, Trump's tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about tweets that Trump didn't publish.
If his staff had kept him from trouble at least several times, their efforts had not been wasted.
But no one was ever able to stop the Trump from pouring the oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by submitting the Trampu material, whether reliable or not, that confirms their views.
"Politics" - just before this story - wrote in May about the Councillors' willingness to constantly raise the President's doubts.
Here is an example described by reporter Shein Goldmacher:
“The current and former Tramp staff members say that Trump can react very strongly to negative press reports, especially with dangerous leaks of information, and will not be calmed until they find who was behind them.
This was the case at the end of February, when someone put the president on the press with GotNews.com, Charles K. Johnson's website, in which the deputy head of Katy Welsh's apparatus was accused of being "looking for a few escapes" in the White House.
It is not important that Johnson was forever banned from Twitter for aggressive behavior, that he did not present specific facts, or that in the past he had made false accusations and then renounced them.
"Tramp read the article and began to inquire about Wells."
Goldmacher adds that the then head of the Rains Pribus machine and the Secretary of the Rob Porter machine “tried to build a system to manage and document the flow of papers received by Trump.”
How did it work?
Three months later Kelly's trying to do the same.
He may prove to be more effective manager than Pribus, but Trump still has an impulsive nature and his assistants continue to fight each other for influence.
These constant factors make the task of Kelly very difficult.
The Tunisian Public Prosecutor ' s Office fights HIV dissident
The Prosecutor ' s Office challenged the decision of the Kalinin judgment of Tumeni, which ended the criminal case against the local resident, in which a young daughter was killed by HIV.
As a result, the child died because the mother was HIV dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court released her from liability for reconciliation with the injured father.
The Prosecutor ' s Office believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished so as not to create a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case concerning the Tumeni population was initiated under article 1, item 109 of the RF (cause of death on care) in April, after her three-year-old daughter died of HIV infection 4B.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the mother herself is HIV-infected.
“The woman did not treat herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that there was no HIV infection”, explained the Prosecutor’s Office of the Tumen Region.
The criminal case was brought before the Kalinin judgment in Thumena, which had decided on 25 July to terminate it.
The request was made by the father of the deceased girl, explaining that “he forgave the woman, he had no claim to her, she had done harm and apologized”.
The Prosecutor ' s Office of the Court of Justice has not consented to and appealed for the annulment of the decision to terminate the case and to refer it back to the Court for further consideration.
The girl died, and it's impossible to starve the crime.
The HIV-infected mother, contrary to the doctor's recommendations, refused to survey the baby and treat her for a dangerous infection," the Public Prosecutor ' s Office reported.
In the opinion of the supervisory authority, it should be punished, otherwise other HIV dissidents would follow its example.
As reported in the Timorese AIDS Centre, about 12 children with HIV are currently not receiving medical attention because of parental rejection in the Timorese region.
“And this situation has already improved - during the year of the work of the special group of half parents who have categorically refused to treat HIV children, have changed their opinion - have allowed diagnosis, have become a drug user”, said the press secretary of the AIDS Centre Elena Loseva.
According to her, it was impossible for parents to act in a legislative manner, and not all HIV-infected children were found, and mothers were not allowed to survey them, were hiding, and were fleeing with children from hospitals.
What are the risks of HIV dissidents?
At the end of last year, Petersburg sociologists presented the results of Russia's first study of the so-called HIV dissident movement.
HIV dissidents are called people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take drugs.
Doctors and AIDS-servicing NGO activists call such views anti-medicine and pose a serious threat to their circulation.
The yellow photo session, which ended in tragedy, took place on Thursday, August 3, at the Grecana railway station in Hmelnik.
The fun company of the young people who had smoked walked by the bridge over the railways, where the truck was just standing.
One of the friends had an idea to make an effective self on the roof of the wagon, reported FACTAM in the police communications sector in the Hmelnik area.
The boy began to descend from the bridge to the train, but because of his lack of caution, he stuck to the power transmission line and was instantly hit by a stream.
Fortunately, this case became known to the station dispatcher, who immediately called the emergency.
Prior to the arrival of the victim’s doctor, they moved to a safe place and then hospitalized in the fire department of the Hmelnik district hospital.
Men were diagnosed with 1-2 degrees.
His medical status is now assessed as stable.
Law enforcement officials remind us that more and more people have recently acquired extreme self-sufficiency on the roofs of multi-storey bridges, bridges that are moving.
The police encourage people to be vigilant and not to allow such photo sessions, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists have allowed oceans to exist in ancient Venus
In ancient Venus, there could have been oceans.
French scientists have suggested this.
Experts have created a computer model that has demonstrated the water education process on the surface of the planet, says Science News.
It was found that in Venus at the beginning of its history, there were oceans where there were 10 per cent more water than there are now on Earth.
Previously, the "Arguments of Weeks" wrote that according to scientists, the ocean could have existed on Mars 4 billion years ago.
Foreign experts have concluded during their research that the water facility was located on the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people were injured as a result of a park shooting in San Francisco
In San Francisco, three people were injured as a result of the shooting, reported to the Associated Press.
The incident occurred in Dolores Park when there were a large number of visitors.
According to the witnesses, several men on the bridge began screaming threats.
One of them picked up a gun and started shooting at people.
The appearance of the evildoers could not be considered, since they had everything but the eyes.
Another medical assistance was provided, after which he was released.
The third injured is a minor, no details of his condition.
Located on the Dolores Park hill, it is a popular place among locals and tourists.
On 1 July, at least 17 people were injured during the night club shooting in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several more visitors were injured trying to leave the room.
The Louna rock group will present a new album in Barnaul
The Louna Rock Group concert will take place in Barcelona on 17 October.
The musicians will present their new album “Wonderful New World”, which has become one of the most expected releases of the year.
The collection will prepare a conceptual show that will become the brightest in the concert history of the group.
"Wonderful New World" is the fourth album by the Russian rock group Louna.
Its name is related to the famous antiotopic novel O.Haxley, "The Strange New World".
The new songs do not tell the book, but they tell about the society that lives by the law of anti-topia, “the blind faith of propaganda and the imposed values”.

The gypsies crossed the ravine and returned to the "Million Street"
Some of West Midlands ' most permanent homeowners are once again in conflict with the determined Roma who have been overcome by the local authorities to re-occupy with their homes.
The gypsies parked 20 houses on the railways in a field bordering the rich street of Solihalla, which is called the "Million Street".
Bringing the horses, the young, and the many houses on the wheels, they returned after they had been driven no further than in May, and did not interfere with the robbery of the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactical company found a breach in defence facilities and pushed its vehicles across a site that had been left uninhabited to leave space for the stumble.
The public was attacked by the municipality of Solihalla, saying that it was “incapable to solve the problem”.
The Anonymous resident said, “They came here on the night of Monday, after they had been driven from the town of Ben Het, where they had been stoned.”
The municipality should be shocked and forced to act because they were unable to solve the problem altogether.
The gypsies were here in May, they were chased, and here they are again.
Last night there were more gypsies, and today it might be even more.
“The Birmingham municipality knows how to solve this problem, they get long-term judicial decisions to protect their parks,” she added.
I live on Streetbrook Road, and I don’t like that I keep paying municipal tax, and the municipality can’t even put an end to it.”
One of the locals who wanted to remain anonymous said, “This is ridiculous. We just saw these gypsies go away the previous time, and here they are, please, continuing.”
This time they were more and more, and we saw the horse pecking at them.
The representative of the Municipality of Solihalla said: “We know of an illegal camp on the ground next to Streetbrook Road and we are working with the Solihalla police; we are taking the necessary legal action to prosecute them as soon as possible.”
To help us collect the evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report any anti-social or criminal conduct to the police by telephone 101.
This makes it possible to draw up an opinion on the situation that will be dealt with by the court when we present our case to them.
Crime operates the champagne wine factory "New World"
The Crimean Wine Factory, the New World, is determined to act by converting the New World into the OAU, the New World Champagne Wine Plant, as directed by the Minister of Property and Land Affairs of Crimean Anna Anujhina.
100% of the company's shares will remain in the ownership of Crimea.
The statutory capital of the stock society will be 595.5 million rubles and will consist of 5,955 million ordinary shares of nominal value of 100 rubles each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea stated that if there were no means to modernize the enterprise for the next three years, there would be a risk of a stopover.
The basic amount of the enterprise ' s funds is around 60-70 per cent.
The modernization of the enterprise requires 1.2 billion dollars, and owing to the organizational and legal nature, it is obliged to give 50 per cent of its income to the budget.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernisation plan.
"Getting money from the owner is a problem, talking about attracting loan funds from large credit organizations is difficult," said Crimea Sergey Petelin's death warrant in April of this year.
The Crimea Parliament included the enterprise in the 2017 privatisation forecast.
It was proposed that it be put into action and placed on the market.
The Interfax source in the Crimean authorities estimated the potential value of the company's sale of $40 million, the investor's investment in modernisation of $30 million.
The New World in 2016 increased the production of juicy wines by 2.8 per cent compared to 2015 - up to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, the New World was about to release 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by Prince Lev Golicin as a factory for the issue of Christian wine in his acquired name of the New World.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Suburban third-classes have torn up more than 40 graves
In the Lower Town, the GHI staff have identified civilians who have destroyed 46 graves in the castle of the city of Liskovo.
A third - grade student was an instigator.
The first statement that the burial plots were not known was made in the OMVD of Russia on the Basque Region on 27 June.
In this regard, 24 people were contacted by the police.
As a result, a criminal case was initiated under article 244 of the UC RF “Destruction, damage or desecration of burial sites”.
As a result of the investigation, the police found suspects, two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9 years.
Juvenile offenders told the police that it was interesting for them to see the memorials falling, and that they were motivated by hooliganism.
Preventive activities have been carried out with children and their parents.
Italy is intensifying the tone with regard to NGOs ships that save migrants.
Italy warned NGOs owned by the Mediterranean rescue vessels that they would not be able to continue their work unless they complied with the new rules governing their activities.
“If NGOs do not comply with the new Code of Conduct, it is difficult to say whether they can continue their activities,” said Mario Minnita, Minister of the Interior, in an interview with the Turkish daily newspaper Stampa.
The Minniti warning sounded the following day after the Italian authorities confiscated a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet, suspected that his crew was actually cooperating with human traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which has been working all year round, has refused to comment on the substance of the detailed charges brought against it by the Italian prosecutor Ambrojo Cartozio.
"For us, salvation of human life is and will remain a top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot continue our activities in the search and rescue zone right now," says a statement by the social organization.
"We will only be able to assess all the charges now brought, only after we have gathered all the information and will be able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities have followed the ship of Juventa, owned by Jugend Rettet, since October.
Its crew is suspected that with all the lifeboats it has taken on board migrants who have been sent directly to them by traffickers and that it has allowed smugglers to leave with ships they could use again.
At least one such meeting is supposed to have taken place at only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, as is alleged in the indictment material published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the requirements of the Italian coastal authorities, which control rescue operations in the area, rather than for any other reason.
The Code of Conduct assumes, primarily, that the juvenile court will have on board an Italian police officer who will monitor their activities.
Until only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations agreed to submit to the Code: “Save Children”, “MOAS” and “Pro-Activa” from Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that the new rules were unnecessary but acceptable provided that they would not involve any “significant change or confusion” in its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign are those who received the Nobel Prize of Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said that the sharp decline in recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations indicated that efforts to support Libyan coast protection and cooperation with local mayors had been fruitful.
"In the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He reported on plans for further negotiations with the Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya we don't want to associate with any of the sides of the conflict"
The authorities of the RF have recently significantly revitalized their policies in the Libyan direction, and with visits to Moscow, delegations from the opposing Libyan sides have been involved.
The head of the Russian contact group on domestic settlement at the TIR RF and Gosmud, the assistant of the head of the Czech Republic, Lev Denigow, told "U" what goals Moscow pursues in the region and on whom the rate is based.
The Contact Group on Libya, which you are headed, is almost unknown.
Let's say the contact group on Ukraine knows everything about her.
And here are the curtains of secrets.
What exactly are you doing, what are you pursuing?
The Contact Group was set up on the initiative of MIDI RF and the State.
Its activities are sponsored by the Prime Minister of Foreign Affairs Michael Bogdanov and Adam Delimhanov (Deputy of Duma from Chechnya).
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by the Speaker of the Bishop of Wiacheslav Volodin.
In September 2015, the Russian tanker Mechannik Chebotarev was detained in Libya.
We've been thinking about helping the crew.
At that time, a contact group of military specialists, representatives of Gosmud, had supported our work by the head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadiro.
How did you get it?
Since I have been working on Libya since 2008, I have been asked to lead the group.
Our activities have not been limited to the release of sailors from the Chebotarev Mechanics.
We were able to establish contacts with representatives of all major groups opposed to each other in the Libyan conflict - and by Tripoli (based on the UN-recognized Government in head with Faiz Saradz. - "H") and Tobruk (a parliamentary residence that opposes the Government and supports the Marshal Khalifu Haftar, who controls the eastern areas of Libya. - "H").
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (Libya Deputy Prime Minister, "U"), we were able to quickly agree on the release of Russian sailors.
It was then decided to make more effective use of these contacts, to establish a contact group.
Its aim is to analyse the situation, identify key factors and players, dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I would like to emphasize that in Libya we do not want to associate with any of the parties to the conflict, we are engaging in dialogue with all.
How many people are in the contact group and how many are in Libya?
There are now five people in the contact group.
Among them are people who have experience in power structures, including the Ministry of Defence.
We also wish to include a group of experts on the region, representatives of the Institute of the Middle East of RAN.
There's not one of our staff in Libya all the time, so there's no need to do that.
Are there Russian military advisers in Libya now, instructors?
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All discussions and publications do not match this.
But your contact group has ex-military members...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or, like Misurata, the city is closed to us before a certain time (which is based on teams of militias that played a role in the engagement of Libyan leader Muammar Kaddafi in 2011 and who have been significantly active in the years to come. "U").
We arrived in Missouri in January this year.
We were scared, they said there were Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there itself, examine the actual military potential that is responsible for why there are such rumors as the true role of Islamists.
In Missouri, we met with all the representatives of the forces that were involved in the destruction of IH in Sirte (in December 2016 this city on the Mediterranean coast was repatriated to the soldiers banned in Russia by the Islamic State, "U").
We wanted to see them, to meet these people, to verify that they had played a crucial role in the destruction of IG in Libya, not Khalifa Haftar, who had assigned these merits.
And what is your conclusion?
The Islamic State in Libya didn't win Haftar?
That's not what he did.
Haftar was operating on another front in Benghazi.
And IGs in Sirte fought structures that were subordinate to the Government in Tripoli.
And by the way, we've invited people to Russia to do this anti-terrorism operation.
And they arrived, the visit extended from 19 to 23 April this year, and the Libyan delegation was adopted by the Council of the Federation, the Duma, the MIDI and the Rosggardia.
You, as we have understood, are in all the regions of Libya and are likely to represent the attitudes of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think the ceasefire arrangements, the elections reached at the end of July in Paris, Halif Haftar and Faiz Saradz, will be implemented?
Or, as has been the case in the past, the agreements will be broken, the fighting will resume, the parties will try individually to seize power?
For us, it has already been a good signal that Saradz and Haftar agreed to a regular meeting, not so long ago it was impossible.
In the recent past, both leaders have been extremely negative about each other.
And as for Russia's position...
They often write and say that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe in it.
We faced this situation when they were in Missouri, and Haftar was on board the Russian airman Admiral Kuznetz on that day.
It was a coincidence.
But they didn't believe in a coincidence in Missouri.
They said, ‘Indeed you are a brave lot who have come to us today!’
But our task is to show that we do not only support Haftar, we engage in dialogue with all key parties to the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar were in touch.
Does understanding with Russian partners at the human, emotional, and emotional level facilitate the fact that he has twice studied in the USSR?
And, by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
He's Russian if he knows, it's very relative.
But what he learned from us, of course, facilitates dialogue with him.
And among other things, he's not the only one.
When we communicate with troops in Tripoli and Missouri, we meet generals who have been taught in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And here they speak Russian beautifully.
And they're moving to Russia, and they're kind of nostalgia about it.
Do you consider the early abolition of the arms embargo imposed on Libya to be likely?
Are your Libyan interviewees interested in the delivery of Russian weapons?
They are interested, of course, but, as I have said, we do not engage in this conflict on the one hand or wish to arm each other to the detriment of each other.
We would like everyone to be around the same position.
With regard to the arms embargo, the Libyans are constantly calling for Russia to somehow facilitate its withdrawal.
Libya is now actively promoting the constitutional process.
We hope that the parties will reach compromise decisions and achieve internal consensus.
Then the elections must be held, as was the case at the meeting of Saradja and Haftar.
If the elections were to take place and the legitimate authority was finally elected (and none of the parties now had such status), the issue of the withdrawal of the arms embargo could be raised in the United Nations.
To raise this issue now pointlessly and dangerously will only result in an escalation of the conflict.
During the days of the media, information has been received that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees from Libya, feels abandoned to the fate of the EU allies.
Can Moscow help the Italian partners in this situation by using their relations with the Libyans?
How realistic, for example, is it that Haftar teams will control the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers transporting immigrants to Europe?
Very timely question.
We are actively working on this.
The Italians need Russia ' s support because Moscow is engaged in dialogue with both Haftar and Saradja and Missouri and the South.
In this regard, the tribes of southern Libya play a major role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it about the South crossing the flows of migrants in further invasions?
So, by the way, they turned the buses back where Nigerian migrants are going?
We're doing this.
But it's not that simple.
Some clans and groups are interested in the continued flow of these flows.
We hope, however, that we will be able to bring the South together in the negotiation process between Sarah, Hafter and the tribes of the South.
But for the first time, we would like to see the unity of views on this issue between Haftar and Saradz.
The Head of the Government of Tripoli Faiz Saraj is considered an Islamist, a supporter of the Sharia.
How much radical views does it hold?
Would that not be an obstacle to establishing relations with Russia or the West?
I'll express my personal opinion of him.
In my view, he, on the contrary, opposes radical Islam.
But there are Islamists in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself held the position that Libya should be an absolutely normal country -- a moderately Islamic, open world.
And he is also actively fighting terrorists.
Where did he get that reputation?
It was created by those countries that were not interested in Russia ' s contact with Tripoli.
Tripoli is a capital, where there is legislative, executive and judicial authority.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other public structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in us not going there.
And we've mixed up all the cards and started having an active relationship with both Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we are already reaping the fruits of this work: Rosnefte has concluded a cooperation agreement with the state oil company of Libya - NOC.
Director of the NOC Mustafa Sanalla, with whom the head of Rosnefti Igor Sechin made a deal, directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first discharge of the Libyan oil company, Rosnefte, took place.
What will Russia do to her?
I think it's gonna be a real deal.
And what other economic interests do Russia have in Libya?
Plans to sign contracts with Muammar Caddafi.
These include previous agreements in the field of transport (railway construction), energy (electricization) and a number of others.
Do the Libyans have anything to pay for?
Well, they have oil.
So, as with Iran, is this the oil exchange scheme?
I don't know what the scheme will be, I don't deal directly with these issues.
Indeed, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the main one.
We're actually doing peace work there.
For us, the main thing is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans agree, so that they can establish their own order, and Libya has ceased to be a favourable environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task of helping the Libyan people and expelling terrorists from there.
Do you have any data on the presence in Libya (now or before) of radical warriors from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out.
I met with the representative of the Libyan Security Committee, who said that no Russian and other former USSR nationals have been present to date.
He said he had some 50,000 phone records of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya. "U") and the Russian speech did not sound there.
What, then, of the nations are these warriors?
I don't want to go into that detail.
Then let's formulate the question differently.
How many of the Islamists in Libya are the Libyans themselves?
There are virtually no Libyans, no more than 5 per cent of them.
The rest are the next.
Can Moscow conduct domestic negotiations such as Paris?
There are plans.
We are holding active negotiations with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and we have expressed our willingness to come to Moscow or to the Grozny.
And when can such negotiations take place?
Now it's hard to say.
A few more visits will have to be made, and I hope there will be clarity about the timing and venue of the negotiations.
In the Czech Museum, the charity gathered money for a expensive gift to a sick boy
A nine-year-old boy named Sasha Macola, who has a brain hydrocephalus and complete blindness, will receive a specialized runway on 5 August.
A useful presentation was given by Saše, Minister of Culture of the Moscow Region, Oksan Kosarev, and the Director of the Constantine Bobkov Museum.
The money for the coach was collected during the charity marathon “Don’t Stop Doing Good”, which took place in Melichov on July 15 on the occasion of the Czech Memorial.
Before they got a marathon at the museum from Sashi, who lives in the village of Manushino in the Czech Republic, they wrote, "I don't have any eyes at all, so I asked my mom to write this letter."
"I'd really like to get a runway for my legs to be strong, and I'd feel like I'm learning to walk."
And Sasha's dream is gone!
After handing over to the museum, there will be the Concerto-Postscriptum, a famous pianist, a well-deserved Russian artist, Alexander Gindin, to fill in the scents of popular classics.
During the charity marathon in Melichov, the choirs of the Voznań David Desert, the belligerent of the master Ili Drozdihin, students of the Moscow Conservatory of the name of P.I. Chaikov and the Russian Academy of the Names of Gnesins, the artists of the Melichov Theatre of the Czech Studio.
For visitors, auctions were held, book fairs and charity sales of souvenir products with a marathon logo were organized.
The Melikhovo Museum took the initiative to commemorate the Czech Day on 15 July on the one day of charity in all the museums of Podmoskovya.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevska Gjitomirska near the local football stadium shot several times at the young people who were there.
According to the suspect, he was upset by the noise, reported to the FACTAM in the police communications department in the Gjitomir area.
After that, the man went into the coffee shop nearby.
There was a conflict in his building, during which a man used a rifle gun to shoot a man, wounding one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old is provided with the necessary medical care, and there is no threat to his life.
Police and early medical assistance arrived at the scene, but the shooter was still hiding.
The law enforcement officers established his identity and detained him on the same day, on 2 August.
A man could not explain his actions.
He's got a device taken to shoot the lawnmowers that was sent to the lab.
The fact is that the criminal proceedings under article 296 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine have been initiated.
The detainee is threatened with deprivation of liberty for a period of between 3 and 7 years.
Remember, in Kiev, Luqyanovska, Tatarska Street, the night of July 28th, a gunfight occurred.
Michelle Carter's sentence for reports of Conrad Roy's suicide
Massachusetts resident was sentenced to two and a half years ' imprisonment for causing her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, to be killed by text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20 years old, will have to be 15 months behind the chain and another 5 years of trial.
Carter was found guilty of the unintended murder of Conrad Roy in June, which ended on 13 July 2014.
Father Roy said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family was killed in a rage.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free before the appeal.
She was threatened for a maximum period of 20 years, but her lawyers said that she and Roy had suffered mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red pants and a creamy shirt, heard the sentence standing, shaking his hands and dropping his eyes off.
"With her actions she killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve her.
She didn't admit her responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show any pride."
But lawyer Carter said it was "a tragic case she deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Monice said that he felt that her “age, level of maturity or even mental illness did not significantly affect her actions”.
The prosecutor read a statement by the mother of Roy Lynn Roy saying, "It's not a day since I'd mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I manage - I try to support his sister despite all the pain that will remain with us forever," he says.
Sister Roy Camdin Roy said that she was continually pursuing the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become his children’s aunts.
"The man who has always been with me since my birth is the pain that will remain with me for the rest of his life," she said.
This case would appear to be a legal precedent, since Massachusetts had no law to provide for the responsibility for the advice of a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in a car with symptoms of gas poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
In a case, attention was drawn to the whole country when it became known that it had been pushed into the suicide of Carter's message.
"You can hang out, hang out on the roof, stab yourself with a knife I don't know how many ways," she wrote in a few messages sent two weeks before his death when he was breathing with his family.
In a few minutes before her suicide, she wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad," and, "You just have to turn on the fire, and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Monice said that Carter wanted to get attention through Roy's death and prevented her from communicating with the press so that she could not get what she wanted.
The views of lawyers on this matter have been divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British neighbor in Italy for the apartment and was acquitted two years later.
Ninety-year-old Nox published her special opinion in Los Angeles Times, which stated: "Michel Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Evgeny Bogchev: "I let Langford go like a high-flight bird."
One of the best basketball players in the single TTB League, 33-year-old Keith Langford left UNIX.
The care of the U.S. Ombudsman, News, was commented on by President Evgeny Bogchev.
Keith made the decision on family circumstances, said Evgeni Bogchev.
He's got a little kid, a woman who didn't want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I decided to go see him.
Of course, I could say no and extend his contract, but he deserved another relationship.
He played three seasons in UNIX and in each match he showed a high level of exposure to 100%.
That's why I let him go like a high-flying bird.
We thanked him.
We want him to succeed in his family life and in his career.
Keith Langford won at the club for three years, winning the Single League silver-2015/16.
In the 2016/17 season, he won the most successful Euroligi season game.
He scored 21.75 points on average for the match.
This result is the second since 2004 when the prize was established.
Langford, who also won the prize in 2014, became the second Euroliga player in the history of winning the prize more than once.
Soon Langford will sign a contract with China's Schengen, informs Eurohops.
It is expected that the American will conclude a two-year contract of $5 million.
Langford will be the second Euroliga star in July to go to the Chinese championship.
Previously, Jannis Burusis was transferred to the Chinese CBA to the former Panatinicos Centre.
A sun-burning tourist from Podmoskovya evacuated by helicopter in Adige
Adige rescuers today were evacuated by helicopter from the mountainous area of the Republic of the Sub-Moscow Tourist, who received the strongest sunburns.
The man took a break at the Fist shelter at a height of 1.6 thousand meters.
The 27-year-old tourist experienced increased pressure and difficulty breathing.
Preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
To the rescuers, the leader of the tour group told me that the fires had been received by the man.
Audio must be modified to 850,000 diesel cars
The day before the announcement by Audi, BMW, stated that they would propose updating software to more than 350,000 vehicles.
The President of BMW said that the company believed that there were “more intelligent ways than driving restrictions”, meaning European cities, including Munich, where BMW was located, which considered the possibility of banning or restricting the use of diesel cars.
Daimler said Thursday that he modified three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies have called their step back.
European auto manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to facilitate compliance with carbon dioxide rules.
But nitrogen oxides that release diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The value of equipment that neutralizes diesel exhaust gases is also increasing for car manufacturers and maintaining a competitive price for cars is becoming difficult.
While the German auto producers are under close attention, the Government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has also accused it of attacking powerful auto producers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
Companies are trying not to repeat the error of the Folkswagen, which has hidden the use of so-called “decommissioning devices”, which during the test could control the number of emissions of harmful gases in order to comply with the rules and be shut down under normal conditions.
In the United States, several leaders of Folkswagen were convicted, and the others were prosecuted on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month in Germany, the former head of the Thermodynamics Division was arrested in the Audi engine development group.
The former manager, Zacqueo Jovanny Pamio, is an Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may be brought before a court in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a German criminal investigation involving Folkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European emission rules and expanded the investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could create serious problems for Folxwagen: the manufacturer of elite cars is a source of disproportionately high proportion of Folxwagen's income.
In Astrahani, a coffee visitor paid by fake money
The police reported to the bank's staff on the redeployment of funds from the general interest, a suspicious purchase of 5,000 rubles.
A study conducted at the Expert Criminal Center has shown that it is false.
According to Russia ' s Astrakhan Region, the banknote was paid by a coffee visitor who bought the syrup.
It should be noted that the case was not equipped with a buyer ' s realization device.
Police are currently establishing individuals involved in the manufacture and sale of a sub-individual CB RF ticket.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs calls on the inhabitants of the Asstrahan area to be careful in financial transactions; it is recommended that trade facilities be set up to verify the authenticity of the funds received.
Astronomers have found a hellish planet where even iron can swim.
For the first time, after studying the properties of the giant exoplanet’s stratosphere called WASP-121b, astrophysics were not surprised by its temperature, which was capable of evaporating iron and other metals.
Experts have pointed out that the water molecules are so heated by the light of the star that they release the infrared radiation.
Hubble's telescope sealed a glowing molecule of water on this gas giant: this high temperature causes the water in the planet's atmosphere to light up in an infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called "hot yupiters" - gas giants, by size and mass comparable to the largest planet of the solar system, but located ten times closer to the parental star.
Because of this year, only 1.3 "earth" days are on the exoplanet, and its gas shell is nearly 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit [2,500 ° C].
Climate change threatens the lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and South France, but now fear is expressed that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavanda has become worse because of drought and infectious diseases; this has caused the constant headache of scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Shes, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, says: “Lawanda in Provence is indeed at risk because in recent years this plant has felt the effects of climate change: the spring and especially the autumn of the rain has become much smaller.
This affects the life of the lavender.
And there are small cicadas that are spread over the leaves of insects carrying microbacterials; in very dry weather they become very much."
There's a lot on the map.
Lavanda not only attracts vacationers; lavender oil is very spicy in perfumery and cosmetics.
Eric Shes says: "Instead of very long wheels with a large number of large colors, we have small, undeveloped, weakened or even missing.
That's why we have less parts containing Epheric Oil."
The solutions currently under consideration include improving the distribution of water and slowing the evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the extraction of more dry-resistant varieties.
Ambassador of Winter University - 2019 met with school students from the Red Sea
The second world hockey champion, Ambassador of Winter University-2019, Alexander Semin met with the opening hockey players and gave autographs to the sick.
The meeting took place at the Winter University-2019 tent as part of the thematic week devoted to chess hockey.
Any visitor to the tent could have wandered on the horses on the ground with artificial ice.
In addition, estaphethes, Victorian and games were organized with the violation of the sovereign product of student games, the demining of the aerobics federation.
50 schoolchildren attended the event.
Alexander Semin advised the boys to do sports as much as possible and stressed that the most important thing in the early stages of training was hard work and a public desire to do hockey.
"Hall right, there's a place in Krasnoyarsk like the Winter University-2019 tent, where starters can ask direct questions to team trainers," said the champion.
We note that promoting student sport and a healthy way of life among redsmiths helps the messengers of the Winter University-2019.
The University Charter will operate throughout the summer season until 25 September, reports the Winter University-2019 Press Service.
The words of Medvedev have been commented on in the House
The official representative of the U.S. Department of Hosts Hisser Neuert, commenting on the briefing by Prime Minister Dmitria Medvedev, stated the need to find “areas for interaction” with Russia.
According to her, such areas should be found to “improve bilateral interaction”.
As an example of such successful cooperation, Nawert called Syria a peace agreement.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia must be able to work together," said the diplomat.
However, Nauert refused to comment on Medvedev ' s claim for a full trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia said so, then she has, of course, the right to speak, but I can't say anything more about it," said the representative of the House.
Former U.S. President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, the head of the Government of RF Medvedev said that Washington had declared Moscow a highly commercial war, with the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also stated that United States sanctions would operate for decades.
In addition, he considered the Prime Minister, the American facility "pure game" Trump.
The missing man in the Sub-Moscow Bodibuilder was found on a foreign land with lost memory.
Bodybuilder Shamil Hanmetov went down the road in Noginsk on 25 July under very picant circumstances: he came out of the car room to enter the toilet.
It was successfully searched for familiar and local residents for seven days.
And Shamil was on a stranger's daughter in Ramensk.
He was found naked in his master's bathroom.
The Daguestan athlete couldn't explain what happened here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name, and the passport was gone.
Identifying the identity helped the announcements of his failure.
On the outside of the doctor's office, Hammetov had a partial memory loss and a brain trauma, reports the public of Mash.
Probably the sportsmen are waiting for other surprises.
The abusers who kidnapped Shamil may have already been in his apartment, which he also stole from.
Oil revenues in July exceeded the forecast of 7.4 billion rubles
The actual oil revenues received as a result of July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion rubles, says the Ministry of Finance.
The increase, as explained by the department, was mainly due to a higher exchange rate of the United States dollar to rubble compared to the average monthly value of June used for the assessment, as well as to the fact that the actual volume of production of gas and the volume of exports of oil products at the projected levels.
“In August 2017, the drop in federal oil budget revenues from the monthly assessment under the Federal Law on the Federal Budget for 2017-2019 is projected to be +40.2 billion rubs,” said Minfin's report.
Thus, the total amount of foreign exchange funds sent to the domestic currency market from 7 August to 6 September 2017 is 47.6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily purchase of foreign currency will be equivalent to 2.07 billion rubles.
The Bank of Russia will be attracted to foreign exchange purchase operations by Minfin Russia.
Every working day during that period, the CB will conclude foreign exchange purchases at the organized Moscow Stock Exchange on an equal basis during the trading day.
The acquired foreign currency will be recorded in the accounts of the Federal Treasury in the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist emphasizes that Mexico is becoming more and more dangerous.
Weekly officials of the newspaper Riodos usually meet in the middle to discuss plans to address recent violent crimes in Sinaloa, related to organized crime, corruption of officials or wartime drug addicts.
But today, overwhelmed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told that they had to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking children with them to an office where they had already dropped a grenade in 2009 or leaving their home.
Security experts wrote three words on the board in the room: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name each column - evidence is not necessary, suspicions and internal feelings will be sufficient.
These are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being in detention by the Government or cartels, a list of minors, which makes the work of lighting chaos in Mexico dangerous.
Violence does not advance, and there are more and more journalists in the country: according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrico Pena Njeto took his office in December 2012; 589 people are under federal protection following attacks and threats; and at least seven people have died in seven states this year.
Among the last are their publisher and inspiration, co-founder of Riodos, Javier Valdes Cardenas.
"The only big mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Waldès wrote in one of his many books on drug-related violent crimes.
His absence is very intense, although his presence is a large picture of Valdez, which shows the middle finger, with the title "Justice" hanging on the facade of the Riodose building; two reporters of 30, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry football with his smile, face in the eye or his firm banner.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although the Office of a Special Federal Prosecutor for the Investigation of Journalist Cases was organized in 2010, only two cases have been investigated according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of drug trafficking and organized crime killed each year, journalists rarely appear before the court.
Journalists Riodos insist that they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, although they have been killed in grief, although much more dangerous now.
Without information about the killers, without justice from the security talks at the meetings, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to waste time at this seminar," he says.
"Until we know the reason, we suspect everyone."
On May 15th, Valdès left the Riodos office in the capital of the state of Kuliakane.
He was able to travel only a few blocks before two men stopped his red Tototo King, pulled him out of the car, and shot him 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which means "Twelfth River."
The shooter left on his car and smashed it nearby.
Valdès was 50 years old.
He still has a wife and two adult children.
Hearings usually run fast on Kuliakan.
But it's almost all about Valdès.
Since Guzman was arrested and released in the United States last January, Sinaloa has been one of the most bloody battles in the country, since rival factions are fighting to fill the established vacuum.
We will not talk about killing one or more people every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or about the cave being filled with two-storey mauls of drugs that are more than home to many living people.
Let's forget for a minute that the state of "peace" is just when one of the shipyards takes control of a marine state with important ports and drug traffic routes leading to the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdès was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ishmael Bohorkes, a 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodos, was overwhelmed by the feeling of guilt that he could not protect another.
He thinks the murder helped two mistakes.
First, an interview was published with Damaso Lopes, the leader of one of the rival factions of the cartel, who fought with the sons of Guzman.
The publication may have upset the sons; people who were supposed to be members of the gang bought all the copies as soon as they were delivered to the kiosk.
The second mistake was that he did not make Waldès leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper that wrote about the same story was seized.
Valdes was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as a regular milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He's been out of danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he'd always be.
He was an experienced reporter in Noroeste and in 2003 he and his five colleagues founded Riodose, sold his 50-dollar shares.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to do journalism without touching the topic of drugs”, Bohorkes said.
In time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest publishing, sales and advertising revenues.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reports without fear of censorship, and readers were attracted to what they could read in this publication about what no one else dared to write.
Eight years after her foundation, Riodose received a prestigious Maria Murs Kabo award for the Latin American reporting work.
In the same year, Valdès won the International Press Freedom Prize for the courage to investigate Mexico ' s drug trafficking wherever it took.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the CPJ Prize.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa -- "this is the way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompevinto TV.
"You have to take on the tasks that lie on you as a journalist or you're just fooling around."
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The staff of the Riodos miss the Valdès, the butcher who joked about being a trucker in the port, the other, generous of the scope and advice, the teacher who knew how to settle in the living.
They relied on their own order.
He was always supposed to wear his hat.
He had to go to El Guayabo, bar opposite the office, and always sit there with the same chair.
Now they ask: Did his love for the uniform order of things destroy him?
His death made them doubt their calculations of how best to do their work and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you understand their wives, their children, their legal business and underground drug transport airports.
"These things were for hell," said Bohorkes.
The result, even in the best of times, was a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
Stay away from what smells bad.
The problem, says editor "Riodose" Andres Villareal, is that "absorbing can be deceptive... and then what happens to Javier is happening."
The old rules, he and others said, no longer operate in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where there is a poisonous mix of profitable trade routes, weak government institutions and corrupt officials.
Landshaft is changing all the time.
In the room where Riodos staff gathered for security training, hundreds of telephones were immediately prohibited: a few days before it was known that spy programs sold exclusively to Governments were used in Mexico to trace journalists and social activists.
Two policemen are hiding outside in the shade of a 104-degree heat source (40 degrees Celsius).
They were assigned by the Government to protect the Riodos office, which is located in a four-storey building in the bourgeois district of Kuliacan.
Some reporters questioned whether these police officers were among the 50 per cent of the officers of the order that the governor himself said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to the worst place, which is in fact under the control of a gang of drug traffickers.
In the next issue of "Riodos", three main topics were considered.
It's a murder at Sinaloa's brother's ex-winner boxing champion, Julio Cézar Chavez.
They still had government expenditures concentrated in the Governor ' s hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping in one of the most expensive Kuliacan restaurants in the district of the prosecutor's office.
It was not officially announced who had been kidnapped or how it happened, so it was necessary to be careful when it came time to write that everyone in the city knew that it was a favorite restaurant at the same time for drug dealers and authorities.
One of their journalists learned from the open database that the restaurant had been registered as a policy of the ruling institutional-revolution party (PRI), which dominated at all levels of authority during almost the last century.
A number of PRI governors have recently been charged with gross corruption.
Villareal asked journalists to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including when the son of El Chapo pushed Guzman away from the military.
A few months ago, readers would have been looking for a Waldess column with the most reliable information on kidnapping.
"Before we knew what had happened," says 46-year-old Villareal, for his artistic body called El Flaco.
"Today all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
The Waldes office is now being used as a warehouse for posters and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists, because officials have become what they never thought they would become: activists on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posters and went to the local prosecutor's office for a demonstration the next morning.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in the state of Michoacán in the west three days after Valdes was killed.
They found a burned body, and the authorities said it was him based on DNA tests.
All over the country, journalists have become loud, protesting, and writing "SOS Press" on the sidewalks and walls of their homes.
On that day, Director Bohorkes was in Washington to seek international support for the demands of justice in the Valdès case.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the next day after the murder of Valdez Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their killings for telling the truth.
Afterwards, she asked not to give her any further task in lighting up the Government ' s activities, fearing that anger would damage her objectivity.
Valdès often said that journalists in Mexico were “rounded” by organized crime, its partners in the government and a diverse society.
In his last book "Drug Journalism", he wrote that reporters are not just killing a gang of drug traffickers; they are doing so by the orders of security politicians and services in conflict with organized crime.
The Press Protection Committee, Article 19, believes that half of the attacks on journalists last year were conducted by police and government officials.
"You die in Mexico because they want to shut you down," says Ramirez.
Of course, killings scare people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Masias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
On her body they found a note that was allegedly written by a cartel named Zetas, "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and earrings were next to her head cut off.
Some editions preferred to close up like the newspaper El Norte in the northern state of Chihuahua after her correspondent Miroslav Brich was killed in March.
Others continue to be like El Manjana from Nuevo Laredo after her leader was killed in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Huarez publicly addressed drug addicts with an editorial article on the first page entitled “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists left their homelands or even the country.
It's a painful solution.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they continue to look at the dangers in the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as it seems, with the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in Mexico's apartment three months after he left Veracross.
Those who remain and continue to work are balancing risk decisions on a daily basis.
Ibarra, who once dreamed of being a poet, admits that he was afraid to write about drug trafficking.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, in the middle of the night when the last issue was ready for the press, the publishers of Riodos sat on the sidewalk next to the office and drank beer when their phones suddenly called at the same time.
A series of shootings between opposing gangs and security forces near the resort city of Masatlan left 19 troops behind, as confirmed.
The war continued to burn, as promised in a series of messages from the cartels found in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they put news on the Riodos website via their mobile phone.
The next day, the first page had to be changed.
The sirens have been called nearby, another shot in the circles.
Bohorkes saw if the police were ready to defend them.
If they were scared, they wouldn't show it at all.
Sitting under the huge portrait of the late founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was exposed to the entire Sinaloa, the Riodos staff continued his work.
"How can you think of closing up," said Bohorkes, "if on the very day Javier was killed, the practitioner asked me to send her to the street to report?"
Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it seems to be a statue, even though it is a horrifying horror.
Researchers have said that the first remains of an incredible substance of the size of the rhino discovered by the Canadian mine were so well preserved that experts called it "Mona Lisa among dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that they could even determine that the color of his brownish skin was red and that he had, in some way, a “dark past”.
The report published in the journal Contemporary Biology described it as “the only one well preserved from Tyreofor throughout the history of finds and one of the best specimens of dinosaurs in the world”.
This is an excavated, recently found, copy of the bridge that lived in the middle of the mill period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredible good condition has affected researchers who call it “very remarkable”.
This grassy tyreophor is the best preserved species in the history of finds, according to articles in the National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Sean Fank when he worked on the Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He stumbled upon something that seemed to be different from the environment, and he decided to look more closely.
The found excavated was sent to the Royal Tyrrellian Paleontological Museum.
For the next six years, work was being done on finding an animal deep in the ground at a mass of 2500 ft (1,100 kg).
Now that all this hard work has been done, the final result can be demonstrated.
“It’s only easy to get excited, and it’s almost impossible to believe that he is asleep,” said the leading author, Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrellian Paleontological Museum, where the establishment is demonstrated.
“He will come into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well preserved specimens of dinosaurs – Mona Lisa among dinosaurs.”
By studying his skin, the researchers found that it was grassy, although it was covered with pancers and reminded of a walking tank, it was apparently under considerable danger from the dinosaurs.
This powerful pancier-covered dinosaur used a red-and-white camouflage to hide from predators and used a protective technique known as a protective ornament, which many animals today also enjoy.
This would allow him to interact more quickly with the environment and avoid encountering with enemies, according to experts, assuming that he had been hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This figure, at 110 million years of age, was widely highlighted in the press in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrellus Paleontological Museum.
The scholars have already studied the animal and named it Borelopelta markmitcheli in honor of the museum laboratory Mark Mitchell, a member of the group who spent more than 7,000 hours on his dome.
The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and the international group of scholars to document the drawing and shape of the shells and plastics on his body.
They found a protective ornament, a widely used method of protection in the kingdom of animals, which means that the top of the substance was darker at its bottom.
Although the protective ornaments are well distributed, the opening has become unexpected, because the size of Borelopelta dinosaur is significantly higher than the size of the present-day animals with the protective shield.
It can be assumed that the dinosaur has been so actively driven by floating dinosaurs that evolution has preferred to mask confrontation as a way of survival.
But most modern animals with a protected area, such as elephants, zebras or elephants, are much smaller in size and are more readily available, indicating that there was a serious need to fight for survival.
“A serious threat from predators to a massive, powerful dinosaur panci shows how dangerous were the predators of the Mela period,” said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in the dinosaur shell also shows that its skin should have been red and brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about its life, including the preserved contents of its food tract, to find out that it was eaten during its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into the river and was taken into the sea, where he sank and turned down the bed at the bottom of the ocean.
Back then, Alberta was as warm as it was now in South Florida, and rivers and oceans were likely spreading much deeper into the land than they are now.
“This necessity is truly remarkable because it is fully covered by the preserved peeled skin, and at the same time it is fully preserved in three dimensions while retaining the original shape of the animal,” Brown said.
“As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it used to be in Ranan’s melon period.
There is no particular need to resort to imagination to restore it, it is only necessary to slow down, and it can be practically believed that it sleeps.”
The clay period is the time when giant earthworms, floating dinosaurs, standing on two feet, roamed the earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, the tyrannozavre Rex, lived millions of years later than Boraelopelta, one of his terrible ancestors could be hunted down by a typhoon.
These include acrocantosaver, a monster of 38 feet (11.5 m) in weight of six tons.
Scholars, whose recent findings are published in the journal Modern Biology, believe that Borelopelta was introduced into the sea after death and mummified into the sea.
The creature was found by Sean Fank when he worked on the millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum staff, this is the most well-maintained tyreophor in the world, along with skin and panci, and it's purpose, from the morgue to the bones.
On average, these substances reached about 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
They were characterized by two twenty - two-thousand strips of shoulders.
Researchers believe that this grassy tyreophor has been hard to believe that it is now Canada until the floodwaters have brought it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept his pancreas accurate to the smallest detail.
The stone remains of this particular specimen have been preserved so well that the remains of the skin are still covered by the buggy pancreatic plates along the dinosaur’s skull.
As Michael Errorko wrote in the article for National Geographic, such a degree of preservation “is rare as winning a lottery. ”
The longer I look at him, the more devastating he seems.
Rocky remnants of the skin are still covering the bugristy crustaceans that harvest the animal’s skull.
His right front leg stretched out along the side, five fingers were turned up.
I can count the chips on his floor.”
Michael Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without documents
Michael Saakashvili, formerly head of Georgia and then the Odessa area in Ukraine, arrived in Poland.
He did so without documents confirming his identity and nationality.
The Polish edition of TV Republica, which posted on its YouTube channel, reported the arrival of Saakashvili.
Saakashvili took part in an event in honor of the anniversary of the Warsaw Revolution against the Hitler forces in 1944.
Because the politician did not know Polish, although he was trying to start speaking in that language, he had to speak English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, the politician addressed Georgia ' s cooperation with Poland and spoke about Ukraine.
The fact that Ukraine ' s immigration service had deprived Ukraine of its citizenship, the police knew that it was in the United States.
It was precisely how he managed to carry out a transatlantic crossing without documents before it was known.
Former Governor Michael Saakashvili of the Odessa Region said that he had been signed on a survey to obtain Ukrainian citizenship.
The politician stressed that he had not completed any polls.
Time limit for proceedings in the case of Winziher and Olkhovica extended until January
The time limit for the preliminary investigation into the case of the co-owner of the company Renova Evgenija Olhovik and the head of the energy holding company "T Plus" of Boris Vianziher was extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Bassmann Court examined the question of the extension of the defendant ' s domestic detention.
The representative of the SC at the meeting reported on the decision to extend the provisional investigation for the last time.
“The particular complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to remove and conduct a large number of documents, as well as to conduct investigations on the territory of several RF actors,” said the investigator.
He added that the suspects were regularly taking over from the Komi.
Their total size is estimated at least one billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Vajnziher, Olhovik, as well as former ZAO leader, Michael Slobodin, who had headed Vipelk until 5 September, transferred to senior officials of the Republic of the Commission the charges for the establishment of the best tariffs for heat and electricity, as well as for the creation of favourable business conditions.
Vinziher and Olhovik were arrested, staged in Siktyvkar and arrested for two months, Freedom of State was hiding from the investigation and was declared a federal investigation.
How did one activist learn the answer to the question “Who’s street?”
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrel was shaken to the depths of her soul.
Only the day after she arrived in New York as part of a tourist trip to St. Louis's nest was sitting on a bed in an apartment rented through Airbnb, overlooking the Facebook tape on the phone.
She's stuck to the post of someone from high school.
It said, "The police have just killed an eighteen-year-old boy, and he's still lying in the middle of the street."
Noting that no one else on her tape had received this information, she closed her Facebook and opened a twitter.
Her tape contained a lot of user posts with nobody @TheePharoah.
Reper from the Greater St. Louis in real time highlighted Michael Brown's death on Twitter, an unarmed black-headed 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photo of Brown's lifeless body scattered across the street, where it will be for four hours.
"It's wild," Ferrell thought.
But death wasn't something new to her and her circle.
She delayed the phone, and later in the evening, she came back to the tweets that people were meeting at the Kenfield Drive.
There were pictures of the signal tape and the shouting people and the man claiming to be the father of Brown, who had a poster saying, "The Ferguson police officer just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a direct broadcast as a police officer stood in front of a group of protesting dogs.
In another video, another police officer, she said, "I'll kill you all... animals!"
“This is a non-standard situation”, Ferrell said, in his own memory.
"It's not murder like the ones we used to and we can call typical.
At the time, I felt a little lonely.
I was angry and cried."
She took a ticket back to her house the next day.
Upon landing at 11 p.m., she took her six - year - old daughter from her father’s house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened with Ferrel and Ferguson in the next almost three years has become the theme of the new documentary “Whos Street?”, which will be released on screen on 11 August.
It is a story of survival and protests, of love and loss, of strength and endurance from the point of view of people living in the community and filling the streets, requiring answers.
While Ferrell was driving to Ferguson with his daughter, dressed in a flower dress and a flowering winery, they remembered the conversation that led up to this morning a countless times, “the experiences of black people and their situation”.
And she said, “Do you remember what I told you about the black people who fought for what they believed?
We're going to Ferguson now because the cop killed an 18-year-old boy, and that was wrong."
"I couldn't take it," said Ferrell later.
“What is happening today is the culmination of... what has happened before.
She needs to know about it, see it, and find out about it.
It should not only be well understood in activism and organizations, but also understand the different levels of experience and their situation and what we must do to be free to be released.
Even if I can provide her with an environment in which she will not personally face obvious racism, she is nothing different from any other black girl.
I feel that I would have done her a bad favor if I had taken it from her."
When they arrived at Ferguson, they first stopped at South Florissant Road, on a field located along the road from the police station, which became a kind of tent camp, while activists were waiting for reports of Officer Darren Wilson's indictment.
Ferrell and his daughter joined the local businessman who had prepared the lunch packages.
They collected the packages and helped to distribute them to the protestors.
At least Ferrell's consciousness took the form of a new type of activism.
“My activism changed completely after 9 August”, she said, noting that as a student of the University of Missouri St. Louis, she was the president of the Association of Sanitary Students, representatives of national minorities, and engaged in food justice and health inequalities among black communities.
“I didn’t have the organizer’s experience.
That's all that's done."
A few weeks later, at the evening demonstration, Ferrell met Saba Follian, one of his directors.
Folyan said that she and her lead operator, Lucas Alvarado-Ferrer, “just wanted to document” the event.
Ferrell came to mind, "Do you want to document or try to find a story to play on?"
This skepticism has been introduced to many people, often white, who have come to the community to benefit from its pain and endurance.
As explained in a recent interview with Follian, “We heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson are not at the center of attention, and they wanted to do so differently.”
By that time, Folyan had joined his director Damon Davis, a local artist, known for his activism on death sentences.
His participation was in sympathy with the project at Ferrel and six other locals with whom the project “Who’s Street?” team maintained contact over the years since Brown’s murder.
"There's no one talking about us in this documentary or with us, that's what we're talking about," Davis said.
“It was most important to me how these people would be represented, because it was how I would be represented.”
Although the project was intended not to focus on Ferrel's experience, it was intended to show that the movement “not about the leader-saviour, but about how the community unites,” Follian said, was the most open part of the film.
As a result, “Who’s street?” shows the unexpected personal aspects of Ferrell’s life, such as how she fell in love and entered marriage with her wife.
“I felt naked,” said Ferrell, laughing about how she first saw the ready product.
“But I understood that when you do this work and humans black people, there must be some level of vulnerability.”
In addition, the story of Ferrel again discusses and emphasizes the role of black homosexual women in the broader context of the Black Life Movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement – those who created the tag #BlackLivesMatter in social networks after the murder of Black Teen Travon Martin in 2012 – are gay.
“Black homosexual women in the leading positions support all this movement,” said Ferrell. “And everything because we are constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden.”
Folyan agreed with this statement, noting that “the movement is actually supported by black women and by many homosexual black women”.
However, she insisted that “it is not a positive case of discrimination”, and that Ferrel was not elected as the central character of the film because of its distinctive features.
“She was the man who woke up this energy,” she said.
“On the other hand, it’s not a coincidence that it turned out first, because when”
You can feel her energy through the screen.”
In the meantime, Ferguson has not been a film camera long, but there is still a complex racial relationship between the community and the police.
Ferrel will be on trial for two and a half years during the demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the place called the house, simply "Bardak".
She's still holding on to the story she learned when she came out on Ferguson's street three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We are not to be lost except in our chains.’
Two Salvadoran football players have been disqualified for the taste of American games
The footballers of Salvadoran Henry Romero and Darwin Seren received long-term disqualifications for non-sport behavior.
During the fourth final match of the Golden Cup of the North American and Central American Football Confederations and the Caribbean countries (CONCAFF), El Salvadorans enjoyed American games.
The first was Henry Romero's defender.
The El Salvadoran bit the attacker, Josie Altidore, and then he grabbed his chest.
Then, in his fine, semi-defense Seren tasted U.S. defender Omar González.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three matches and Seren for six.
The meeting itself ended with the victory of the Americans at 2:0, according to Goal.com.
Similarity: The artist creates portraits using the DNA of Chelsea Manning
At the centre of the hall in Gallery Freedman, New York, people hang from the roof on the sidewalk, white, black and brown, everything incredibly similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Hisser Dewey-Harborg from the hairs and hair clips sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent out cuts from Fort-Levenworth prison, where a former intelligence analyst is running for a 35-year period for a well-known transfer of confidential diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, on 2 August, is called "The Rise of the Similarity".
This is the result of a two-year census between Dewey Harborg, whose art combines technology, information and art, and Manning, a transgender woman and a famous dissident, whom Barack Obama reduced the sentence until three days before the end of his presidency.
By analyzing the DNA from Manning's computer program and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of people with such a genome, Dewey Harborg has created a profound, although difficult to perceive, manifesto about not only the plasticity of DNA data - the different ways in which they interpret and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also the concept of identity.
Manning, who was born named Bradley Edward, but when she was a teenager, openly said that she was a woman, was sentenced to 20 episodes in 2013, including six violations of the spying, computer fraud and theft.
Her photographs in prison were not available, so only one of her photographs was known: a grainy black and white self, on which Manning in platinum was obviously uncomfortable, sitting behind the wheel of the car; with this photograph she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Harborg successfully completed its 2012 Project “Visiting Strangers”.
In it, the artist created portraits of the unknown by means of judicial evidence of the type of scars and of the crop cutting, removing the DNA from the trash and creating images of what these people might look like.
And then she got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They took an interview at Chelsea Manning's prison and wanted a portrait to illustrate the article," Dewey Haggborg explained in a preview of a new press exhibition.
At the time Chelsea was unable to visit and photograph, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted a portrait of her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her fellow prisoners in the museum became associates in the census and exchanged several letters for two years.
They even wrote a comic book entitled "Depressed Images", illustrated by Sholie Kanungo, who outlined how the future president would mitigate the punishment of Chelsea and be able to visit the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama actually decided to release Manning just a few days after the book came out of the light was a pleasant surprise after seven years in a military prison in Kansas.
There is something deep and strong and that the exhibition is being opened right now, when Donald Trump announces war on people who reveal secret information in the Government, and invents new ways to ignite the enemy he is trying to soften on Twitter.
When Dewey-Harborg asked for this to happen on time, she said, "There's nothing wrong with it."
In a statement by the artist written on the wall of the gallery, the huge signature of Manning below (with a heart instead of a point above "i" in her name) calls to put an end to “automatic separation based on sex, race, sexual orientation and culture”.
On the other hand, its mitochondrial DNA, a long shell of carandas C, G and A.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the scientificly researched artist) Dewey Harbor hoped to show how amazingly we all look, in any case, in its biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our gene does not determine what we are, how open genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective it is," said Dewey Harborg; her 2007 video "False memories" is also shown here.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of these stories here."
The last part of the exhibition in one room is the novel mentioned above in comic books.
It features King Kong-style Manning over the U.S. Corrigendum building with a loudspeaker in hand.
"If they kill your speech, they will win," is written there.
"So never shut up."
"This is a direct quote from the letter she wrote to me," says an artist who welcomes us from Philadelphia.
"I still have an ants on my skin when I'm talking about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in person - as it was shown in comics - but when she comes, she will welcome masks in the center of the room, her own genomic simulators, gathered, like a crowd of Protestants.
This is also done intentionally, as is the case at the exhibition up to the height (5"2, growing Manning), on which the karandh was drawn by the genetic group.
"I would have hung them on the walls sooner, but now I wanted them to look like a crowd of people," says Dewey-Harborg about portraits.
"I wanted them to be like the mass movement that formed around Chelsea, like the movement that stood for her release."
North-West University Professor and Oxford University Officer are investigating the murder charge police
According to the police, there is a national survey of the professor of North West University and of the Oxford University staff, who are being investigated as suspects as a suspect of a person being killed in a bright room in Chicago.
According to the protocols of the Cook District Court, on Monday, orders were issued for an intentional murder without the right to be released under the auspices of forty-two-year-old Windem Latham and fifty-six-year-old Andrew Warren for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell Duranlo.
According to the documents, twenty-six-year-old Cornell Duranlo died after being wounded by multiple stab wounds.
In a warning issued by the Chicago Police Office, the body was found on 27 July.
The police called, they came to the Grand Plaza apartment complex and found the victim with several injuries to the body.
According to officials, Cornell Duranlo was declared dead at the scene of the crime, and now the detectives are investigating the death of the knife wounds, considering her murder, while the police are actively investigating the two suspects.
Latham has served as Assistant Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of North-West since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbaj, Vice-President of the University of Communications, reported in an e-mail statement that Latham was on an administrative leave and that he was not allowed to enter the campuses of the Northwest University.
“It is now a criminal case that the authorities are investigating, and the University of the North-West is cooperating with the consequences,” said Kabbadj.
Warren is the senior financial officer of the University of Oxford.
The representative of the University and Somerville College reported in an e-mail statement: “We have contacted the British police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to the U.S. investigative authorities.”
The statement also said that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to give up.
Chicago Police Chief Anthony Gulley said he strongly advised the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“The police have assumptions about where they are, but our attempts to find them are increasing,” said Gulelmi.
According to Gulemi, local, regional and federal authorities are assisting in the search for suspects.
According to Gulemi, the police called the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a secret message that something had happened in number 1008.
The police called the scene a horrific crime.
Gulelmi reported that it was unclear whether the incident itself occurred on 27 July.
According to him, video camera data confirms that Latham and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latema and the victim had relations,” Gulemmy said.
The Grand Plaza Manual issued an appeal to the permanent staff saying: “The police are currently working on the timing of the incident, collecting information on the victim and considering a number of reasons, including possible domestic incidents”.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will meet the WADA road map shortly"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Diping Agency (WADA) for the resumption of the Russian Anti-Diping Agency (Russia) would be met in the near future.
“A certain phase of compliance has been completed, and RUSADA has been given the right to plan and conduct tests with AKAD (the United Kingdom Anti-Doping Agency).
The road map of VADA was updated accordingly," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the road map to restore the status of compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for the renewal of the work of RUSADA and has recently been published on the website of the organization.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could present any difficulties for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be accomplished.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and to the VADA shortly," he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that Russian Andidoping structures should publicly recognize the results of the Canadian lawyer Richard McClaren's inquiry under the VADA order, which claimed that the Russian sport doping was controlled by the State.
In this regard, Mutko said: "We are investigating because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no subprogrammes, and we will not admit what was not."
Mutko repeated the words of Vitalia Smirnova, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Diping Commission.
On the same day, in an interview with the Russian edition of Rsport Smyrnov, Smyrnov acknowledged the previous problems in Russian anti-doping structures, but added: “We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and situations.
No one is going to accept this report," added Smyrnov.
VADA removed RUSADA from doping control in November 2015 following the doping scandal.
However, in June this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Diping Agency (UKAD).
Following the visit of the Moscow office of the organization in July, the Director General of the VADA, Olive Nigglia, said that RUSADA was “moved in the right direction” to restore its work.
A quiet fire in the 79th floor tower in Dubai
The huge fire that took place in one of the world’s tallest residential buildings, the Tower of The Torch, is transmitted by Reuters.
It is noted that the fires have been able to cope with all fires by 4.00 per local time (3.00 msec).
Local authorities reported that the incident had not affected anyone.
At the time of the fire, the streets of the sky were covered.
The reasons for this are unknown.
Previously it was reported that in Dubai, a 79-storey residential skyscraper, The Torch, is one of the highest buildings in the world.
All residents were evacuated on time.
Unimaginable Buzova shake worshipers: cracks that don't cover the rabbit
The scandalous reality-show "Dom-2" by Olga Busz hit the viewers of the Europa Plus Live festival with the puppies.
In the eyes of thousands of worshipers, the newly introduced song with Nastai Kudri has filled out the song "We Will Be Hot."
Both girls went out on stage in provocative "pants" so they looked like the lower white songs.
Buzova and Kudry were signed on the pants.
Earlier it was reported that changes in the appearance of Buzowa were observed by a specialist in a Moscow Plastic Surgery Clinic.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of NATO-Russia relations
On Friday, 4 August, the Radio 4 news service reported with reference to foreign media.
He said that the Russian authorities were responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with the CNN gender, NATO also criticised Russia for the situation with Crimea and “destabilization in eastern Ukraine”.
However, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia was possible, and the further escalation of the situation would not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump said that relations between the U.S. and Russia were at a dangerous low level, and accused the American Congress.
Ekaterinburg Metro adopts a new way of paying
In October, a bank card could be paid for in the Ekaterinburg metropolis, OAU General Pavel Wedernik said in an interview with the District newspaper.
Our goal is to enter the 2018 World Football Championship as well as other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Lower New York and Novosibirsk.
"We want patients from other countries, world guests, to be able to take advantage of the metropolis using their bank cards without buying chips and not standing in line," he said.
Startups that will help your company not become a regular Uber
Amy Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among the staff of her e-commerce startup, but the interviews did not work.
The answers were often inflamed, useless, or worse, unexplained.
And even though she had promised anonymity, some staff members did not trust this process.
“It was never consistent and objective,” said Errett, managing a 75-person Madison Reed in San Francisco company for electronic hair care.
She therefore turned to third parties for assistance.
There is now a new type of start-up with staff that helps companies to find out how their staff feel.
By developing and licensing software, which is a measure of staff involvement, they enable companies to express their views, address specific teams and demographic groups, offer staff anonymity and hotline for complaints, and in some cases allow informants to pass through the top management and direct to the Directorate.
“We now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, and where is Fitbit for your company?” says Jim Barnett, co-founder and President of the Glint startup from Redwood City, whose analytical programs are used by companies to measure employee involvement.
Errett explained that she had gained a greater understanding of what her staff thought and felt in three years of Glint's use.
In addition to the express queries and questionnaires of specific teams, the product offers a company's heat map and shows in a visible way which units have more complaints and which managers have a low approval rating, which allows it to understand why.
Companies are at least aware that they need to monitor the situation at the workplace, otherwise they will become a regular Uber, which became involved in the scandal when the former officer published a post on a blog describing the aggressive situation in which those who expressed dissatisfaction were punished.
For startups such as Glint, it is a desire to control the situation, an opportunity for profitable business.
According to the Internet portal, “Let’s talk about payment” dedicated to financial technologies, the global management, regulation and compliance industry by 2020 may cost more than $118.7 billion.
"Convercent" from Denver, Colorado, which helped companies prevent and detect bad behaviour, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year in the background of Ubera's reputation.
The Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently appeared among clients.
Like "Glint", "Convercent" allows companies to send individual staff opinion polls, collect confidential answers in real-time and view hot maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages, allowing staff members to report misconduct.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints go straight to the branch.
“The Court of Public Opinion has seized the power of inspectors,” said Patrick Quinnlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If it is found that the company is ill-treating staff members or is not ethical, even if the inspector is not involved, the company may face costly consequences in the form of boycotts by clients, staff flow and judicial claims, Quinlan reported.
Ruby Tuesday, a network of restaurants where more than 25,000 staff are employed in 500 institutions, has used Convercent for more than a year to make sure that staff are in the process of rules and procedures and to offer a simple way to contact the company ' s head office.
Earlier, if the staff member wanted to report the problem, he or she had to search for a telephone number or e-mail from the head office, file a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
Often it was a frightening and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, the head of the law firm Ruby Tuesday, who said that there was no normal way to track the complaints of staff members.
Now that the company is using the Convercent service, the problems previously hidden from managers in offices in other cities or states – such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay – can be found and addressed more quickly.
“I can get closer to a complete, comprehensive understanding of the situation of staff members,” said Vitrano, who led the risk management group of the Ruby Tuesday network.
“And we protect our shareholders from judicial proceedings with staff.”
According to Quinnland, the company began to be more serious about the ethics, values and involvement of staff in 2002, after the accounting firm, Artur Anderson, suffered damage due to ethical violations caused by Dell Enron.
But only when “social networks received mass distribution” did the companies realize that they would not be able to keep their dirty underwear from viral distribution on the network.
“Before using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both "Glint" and "Convercent" offer their software as a service, taking regular payments from companies for the use of their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity to gain the approval of venture investors who supported both startups.
In February, Convercent received $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, resulting in a total capital of $47 million.
"Glint" received $10 million in November from "Bessemer Venture Partners", resulting in the company's total capital of $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising if they take into account the interrelated nature of companies, cultures and venture capital.
The increasing volume of research shows that today's staff expect more from their jobs than before.
In markets with fierce competition, such as the Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects, this is only a minimum.
Staff members want to feel that they are being received and appreciated and that they are spending their time with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in companies, they feel that they hear them and that the work they do results, they are more trying to make such a company successful,” says Nina McQueen, Vice President for Global Benefits and Satisfaction of LinkedIn, where both Convercent and Glint are used.
Investors receive income when the company's portfolio is doing well; the company's business is doing well when the employees are committed and involved.
If the analytical instruments of the third party promise to increase the loyalty and involvement of staff, it is not surprising that they find support.
According to culture experts at the workplace, it is important to have data on the involvement of staff.
But the data is useless until the company's supervisors take action.
In fact, if the company requests feedback staff, it may create the impression that there are changes.
And if the changes do not occur quickly enough, or if they do not occur at all, disappointment may develop, and staff will lose interest.
“If you are going to ask for 4,000 proposals, you must be ready to have 4000 discussions,” said Russell Rat, President of the Kutter International Management Advisory Company, who had to see how companies made a mistake, relying too much on data collection.
If you do not go to the end, the officers will say, “Did you hear me?
You don't care?
Why should I not be equal to you?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly staff surveys, is able to take action on the same day that someone reports the problem with Glint.
And, after collecting feedback from staff with insufficient speed of decision-making and communication quality, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve the problems.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new knowledge about her staff and hopes that in the long term this knowledge will help her to keep staff in a high-current industry.
"If you do not try to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.
In Barnaul, a new asphalt on the Krasno-Armies prospectus is being found.
In Barcelona, crucial measures were taken to eliminate the causes of asphalt failures in the Krasno-Armiessk prospectus.
The place where the caves have been built twice for a recent road trip (a intersection with the young street) is decided to "open".
It is recalled that a small section of the road near the tramway was broken because of the land in the area of an uninhabited uninhabited network.
According to Ivan Garmat, the Vice-Chairman of the Urban Committee on Road Management, Well-being, Transport and Communications, will conduct a detailed survey for a detailed survey and the elimination of claims for breach.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is expected that there will be a need to restore the gap between non-domestic communications and concreteization.
This is reported on the official website of the capital.
Team Bruins has to go further because the National Student Sports Association has cancelled training twice a day.
The time is approaching at eleven o'clock; a crowd of footballers from the University of California in Los Angeles is being held back to rewind new training camps on one side.
Some of them rocked their footballs, and they found their backs glowing after the first day of a tense sports camp.
For many players, these minutes of inactivity are a mid-day break.
Games recorded for summer classes will be returned to the community after three hours of training to prepare for the final exams and will return to the Wasserman football centre at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.
Shortly before Monday turned into Tuesday, the coach of the Brunswick Jim Mora team said, "In the next three days these guys are waiting for meatballs."
The fact that the National Student Sports Association has cancelled the training twice a day, which was designed to reduce the burden on players, has actually removed their working day, at least before the end of the exams on Friday.
Therefore, the first three training sessions of the California University team in Los Angeles were scheduled for 7:15 p.m. to be held in and without the full timetable of the games.
As a result of the lack of two trainings a day, more days of one training were involved, and Bruntz was moving the camp almost weekly compared to last year and was training during the summer school for the first time in the six seasons of the Sea of Vesuda.
According to the schedule, they will have to conduct 18 trainings by 20 August, including before formal training for the first game in the season against the A&M team of the University of Texas in September.
He had to say that he supported the amendment of the rules by the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that there had been another item in the scoreboard.
"In three or four days we'll give them this huge load, it's a serious test," said Mora.
“And they just overcame him, and they are working, and they are excellent boys.
I think that when we live until Saturday and we have more time, it will really be healthy.”
At the end of the camp, the University of California in Los Angeles will perform closed training; this is an easy task, since its field is directly visible from the adjacent parking lot and from the nearby Laskin Centre, a expensive hotel that has already been bombed by football balls that have overcome the protection network behind the doors.
The Bruins Games should be held by the hotel starting with these departures, but the Mora admits that when the rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
"We will have security," said Mora.
“This is a serious problem, and I don’t exaggerate the danger, assuming that someone can take off the room, sit there and record the training on the video.
If you have a training video, it's very serious.
But we'll have security there and we'll have security in the parking lot number 8.
We'll do everything we can with what we have.
I won't be too worried about that.
We have a plan."
All victims of a terrorist attack in Petersburg were expelled from the hospital
All those affected during the attack in St. Petersburg Metro in April were expelled from the hospital.
This was reported in the press service of Deputy Governor Anna Mitianina.
According to data at the end of July, there were three people left at the station, broadcast by the TV Centre.
Remember, the explosion in St. Petersburg Metropolitan advanced on 3 April this year.
The bomb was blown up by a terrorist named Akbarjon Jallov.
As a result of the attack, 15 people were killed as well as the perpetrator himself.
In a criminal case, 11 persons, including the alleged organizer Abor Azimov, were arrested.
Remember, before that, Rosusenavár recommended that the Petersburg Metropolitan Plan of Transport Security Activities be revised, in particular by increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook strengthens the fact-finding in the fight against fake news
Facebook will more frequently send texts suspicious of mystifications to independent experts and show their conclusions under the original posts, the world's largest social network, which is trying to combat so-called faecal news, said on Thursday.
In a statement on its website, the company stated that it was beginning to use improved machine training algorithms to identify possible mystifications, send them to check and possibly show the results of the check-in under the baseline.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways of spreading so-called faecal news that many believe have influenced the 2016 presidential elections in the United States.
This issue is also being debated actively in Europe after the French voters were misled by false communications before the presidential elections in May and in Germany before the September elections declared support for the plan to penalize social networks if they do not quickly remove hate-stricken posts.
On Thursday, a separate German-language Facebook statement reported on the testing of a new check-in algorithm, which was launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to seeing what reports are being challenged by independent investigators, people want to have a broader context to make reasoned judgments about what they read and what they share,” wrote Sara Sue, Facebook news manager in her blog.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the "related articles" function and work on other changes in the news feed to address the problem of fictitious news.
Create a novel comic book: One castle in English history
In the recent past, the small castle of Scotland was recorded in the music video Squeeze, and in the 1970s and 1980s it served as a port for Margaret Tetcher.
But for 700 years he watched the stormy history of the Kent Valley of the Beul Valley, and now he inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire woman with hair on her feet, with a tendency to historical documents, to novel comics.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at a man who died 300 years ago," he says with enthusiasm.
"You feel it so personally when you hold this letter in your hand."
The Castle in England covers a period from the Middle Ages to the Evardian era and tells of families who lived in Scotland; each story was illustrated by one of the young British artists, Isaac Lenkevich, Briony May Smith, William Xley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on archival data: in 2014, he wrote "Dear Man's teeth and other stories" - a collection of the British Library's documents; this project suddenly took him to the depths of the soul.
"I was able to untie the print of my finger at the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working on the quays," he says.
"This is the print of his finger."
And the letters will always smell smoke because at that time the lights were lit.
And after 300 years, in the future, you think you're there too.
Oh, how I love archives!"
For a person who has such a passion for old papers, receiving support from the National Fund and the English Arts Council and living in a castle for four months (“I’m honest, I’m a little stuck there”) seems too good to be true.
Rods studied the "new" Victorian castle for days, went through archives, and looked at many treasures of real estate and ancient things, such as the heads of gypsies on walls or bottles that had been in ruins for centuries.
He walked through the park and through the ruins of the old castle, talked to hikers, gardeners, and sometimes artists working on illustrations in his book.
Then at night he "drinked whiskey and sat down to write."
The history of Scotland ' s castle has not been very studied because the National Fund has been fully accessible to it only in 2006 when the last successor, Elizabeth Hassi, died.
When Rods arrived ten years later, the officers were just beginning to understand an archive that he described as "the one that the aristocrats have descended on their hearts for centuries."
The newspapers, the letters of the time of the British Empire, the maps showing who owned it, "You think the land disputes are boring," says Rhodes, "but there were two families behind the shore.
That's right, guys!"
In some stories, the castle collector becomes a point of departure for more extensive research in English history: for example, in "Worker", the hero leaves a newly built castle to join the Christian Revolution of 1381.
“There is evidence of the rebellion that occurred in the castle in 1380, in a book called “Kenta and Sassex Ricers families”, says Rods.
"The Christian uprising began in these places, and I thought the rebellion was a proper beginning.
Maybe they were tied up?"
Other themes are closely related to the history of the castle - for example, the "priest", which tells of the Jesuit priest, whose family of Darrells had been hiding in her home for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "Contrabandist", about 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who was believed to have staged his own funerals by striking the grave with stones (this was discovered several years later when the grave was dug).
Darrella, the beloved Rods family of all who lived in Scotland, said, "The gentlemen seem to have been a perfect juule, they've gone into debt forever, and they've lost money for what they couldn't afford.
In different generations, men and women Darrela have solved their debt problems, marrying rich elderly women - I represent them as a company of nice guys who are able to take care of the heirs of great states."
After the end of the work at the Rhodes Castle, they seek other opportunities for a unique written experience.
He lived two weeks in a Finnish noise, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elamiyaki, a place where there was a sanatorium in the early 20th century, and then it grew again in the forest.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"I felt like this: damn it, I have to go back to real life."
Fifteen major banks choose "Russia"
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: following Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alpha Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselhozbank, Binbank and FK “Openance”, seven other credit organizations are going to leave this public organization.
Thus, at least 80 per cent of the market will come from the ARB organizations.
But this is not just an exit - all banks that have reported a break with ARB - are negotiating with another public institution combining credit institutions - the Association of Regional Banks “Russia”, led by a well-known policymaker, Anatoly Axakov, Chairman of the Committee on the Financial Market, as recognized by the last session and by the most effective leader of the opinion committee and by the MP on the number of draft laws prepared.
The beginning of the conflict within the ARB was set in the discussion in the Council of the Federation when the Interregional Banking Council considered new draft laws, in particular, involving a new classification of banks according to the size of the statutory capital.
At that time, Garrigin Tosunjan, President of the ARB, said that, in the opinion of the association, the bill was adopted for the largest banks, which were thus trying to limit the opportunities of small and medium-sized banks in the regions, by taking over their clientele.
Among other claims, there was also a criticism of the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunjan, did not always justify the withdrawal of licences from some banks, which was, in fact, the objection of the representative of the CB: many of the leaders of the criminal banks, in particular External Prombank, were members of the ARB governing bodies.
Obviously, this exchange of mutually exclusive views in a very sensitive relationship with the main regulator of the banking environment has become a clear reason for the fifteen major banks, in breach of ARB policy, to prepare themselves to join the Association “Russia”, noting that “the effectiveness of the ARB’s work is at a low level and that a constructive dialogue within the banking community is not actually conducted”.
The investors will be better off
What's going to happen?
Let us respond immediately to the main question that arises in or near the banking field in a minor or conflict: there is no threat to investors, rather, to the credibility of the banking system.
Headed by "Russian" Anatoly Axakov, known for his curiosity about all the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional who is highly valued at the Central Bank: almost all the management of the CB is present at the annual activities of the association and all the significant legislative initiatives of the regulator are carried out through the expert evaluations of the “regional”.
The staff-organization plan obviously does not include any special shocks.
Without a doubt, the ARB is in a difficult financial and management situation after such powerful and influential actors with their contributions and lobbying opportunities are absent.
However, the oldest organization, established in 1991, which was in the interest of the banking community, had little capacity to continue to improve banking legislation and the scope of monetary treatment as a whole.
It cannot be said that Russia is also willing to accept any new members, according to its leader, Anatolia Axakov (“may be too much to like”), who, on 21 July at a briefing in the Parliament's press centre, said that “the representatives of the banks who came out of the ARB asked me to consider increasing the potential of our association “Russia” on the following day.
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Association Council and to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiation process is now under way, both sides are studying proposals, preparing an extraordinary association conference to be held in Sochi in mid-September within the framework of the International Banking Forum.
That's where we'll be.
Also, Anatoly Axakow, stressing that “no seat” was called a possible new leader of the updated Association “Russia” of Luntowski, who left the post of Vice-President of the Central Bank in September, with a high profile of its business and human qualities.
On 18 August, Anatoly Axakov, who is now resting in Crimea, plans to retire and arrive in Moscow for one day, at the extraordinary meeting of the Association Council of Russia, which is scheduled to consider the event of an extraordinary meeting of Russia.
The entry of cars with a petrol engine in the major cities of Russia will not be limited
The deputy head of Mintransa Nikolai Asaul said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of cars with a petrol engine in the major cities of Russia would not be limited.
It's a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that there should be a gradual improvement in the environmental class.
And there's the concept of going to zero immediately.
I don't think we're technically ready for this.
The question is, what year has it been?
That's the same level of the phrase -- let's not.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
The whole town's closed?
"In 20 years, I don't know, maybe it'll happen," says Prime Minister.
Earlier, the Newspaper reported that, by 17 August, Deputy Prime Minister Arkadia Dvorkovic had been assigned to examine proposals on possible options for the maintenance of electricity submitted to the Government by PAO Director-General KamAZ Sergei Kogogin.
Among the proposals, according to newspaper information, are the use of DVS cars in large cities and resorts.
Washington's changing the rules for obtaining a map.
According to the media, President Donald Trump stated that a new US immigration plan would be adopted to amend the rules for obtaining a stamp.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, a stricter rule on temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in two Houses of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and will do so on the basis of a change in how the United States issues stamps to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new process of making statements will bring benefits to the candidates who own English, have money that allows them to hold on to themselves, and have the skills that will benefit our economy," said Trump, according to the American media.
The phenomenon of sex robots is real, and this should be of concern to us.
We failed to think that 2017 could no longer get worse, a new report on technological progress in the production of sex work came out.
Yeah.
Sex work is now at the center of attention.
The Responsible Robotics Fund (FRR) has recently issued a report on the development of sex work in the next 5-10 years.
In the opinion of Noel Sharka, a well-deserved professor of robot technology and art at the University of Sheffield and a co-founder of the FRR, we must take their appearance seriously.
Users will be able to choose the color of the eyes of the robots, the shape of the nails and the type of nails.
"People are hicking about this, but companies are already sending their customers a lot, and soon we'll see them much more," Sharki said at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inspirational companions into silicone-skin robots, hot-to-peak, and almost human replicas controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also “set up” their robots at their taste by choosing everything from the color of the eyes and the shape of the robots to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have a "identity" compared to which the Stepford Woman would prove to be very progressive is even more disturbing.
Modern sex dolls have become silicone-skin robots.
For example, RealBotix robot enables users to adjust the quality they find attractive, for example, darkness.
There are still sex jobs of Roxxxxy Gold, developed by True Companion, which are provided with a programmable individuality - for example, Cold Farra has the impression of a bulwark, and Wild Wendy has the "mild" character.
"Roxxy Gold has a character that suits you well," the True Companion said.
So she loves what you love, doesn't love what you don't love, and so on.
She's got a mood all day, like she's got this guy!
She may want to sleep or sleep, or she may be "in the mood"!"
In the emergence of sex work, there is a lot of concern - not least because they replace real human relationships - but most of all concern about the subordinate image of women, the association with rape, which causes the Cold (Reading) Fire.
On the True Companion, Roxxxy is compared to the voter, only for men.
"If a woman (sic!) can be a voter, why can't a man be Roxxy?" says the website.
But these sex robots are not just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their appearance and increasing complexity indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, away from the ideal of gender equality to the desire for sex with submission as an optional supplement.
Most men would, of course, not buy sex jobs, and while FRR noted their growing popularity, they remained on the periphery of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be very instructive about the meaning of the age in which we live.
And many people aren't stupid or aggressive until the free market gives them a chance.
It is not a coincidence that these complex sex jobs occurred when women's rights around the world were under threat when the White House had a president, who boasted of what was suitable for women.
The most frightening part of the television series "Rasskas servinica" is not graphic images, distorted bodies and depressed eyes, that is, how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is too much, but now it doesn't seem that big.
The aim of the sex industry is to achieve such a physical similarity to real women (only with the proportions of porn stars) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to tell people that they are being fooled to copy the movements of the human body.
But it's not like these women that work with their "characters."
They can't break up with their partners or leave them.
They don't have their lives or their biographies -- nothing that could indicate independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of complete dependence.
In other words, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, maids.
The native of Los Angeles Eugene (Puch) Jeter, who has been serving as the rally for Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national team at the European basketball championship, the final part of which starts on 31 August.
In an interview with the BeBasket portal, General Manager Andrey Lebedev reported.
We tried to make a deal with Jeter, but unfortunately he won't come under family circumstances.
We're going to the Eurobasket without a naturalized game, because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will enable us to develop our young players," he said.
Remember: With Jeter's direct participation, Ukraine took the sixth place in the Eurobasket-2013 and for the first time hit the basketball World Cup, where the "yellow-blue" could not overcome the group stage, while the U.S. breeder scored an average of 15.4 points, selected 3 points, and handed over 5 gears.
Jeter has stopped speaking for collective Ukraine since his resignation from the position of chief coach of our American team Mike Fratello, who left this post in 2015.
The Eurobasket-2017 will take place simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will conduct its team games on the promised Earth.
In Group B, there will be five individuals: Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3 September), Lithuania (5 August) and Israel (6 September).
In preparation for the tournament, our husband’s collection conducted two controls involving Dutch and Belarusians.
Big Trempa promotion?
Imagining Myth Romany seems very reasonable
In the Trampa era, it was common ground that political disputes that polarized the American electorate destroyed some families on a micro-level basis.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, U.S. newspapers have flocked to the columns on how to deal with the terrible relatives who voted for Trump.
Looks like we're all so tense that we're going to jump.
There's less talk about Trump's ability to unite families.
I'm writing about it because my cousin, the left side of the poetry from Chicago, who had been on knives with Republicans in her family, came to me in New York this week.
She reminded me that a coalition in the fight against the common enemy could have a powerful effect.
At Thrampe in the White House, everyone she knows, including the brother-republic, with whom she had argued over politics for decades, was suddenly and strangely on the one hand.
After dinner it is undoubtedly good; but I cannot think that in a broader context it may be quite dangerous.
Trump inspired the left flank forces, but the deforming effect of his rule can move all of us to the right.
When we're talking about Trump and "normalization," we mean the unlikely possibility that we'll stop hitting his exits once in a while.
There is, however, an even more dubious scenario in which the Trump "normalizes" the most right-wing Republicans who will suddenly become a model of healthy meaning in the light of its standards.
I realized that today I miss the old-fashioned folly of Mitt Romney -- with a dog on the roof of the car and a 14-percent income tax (but we at least knew what his tax statement looked like) -- compared to Trump and what, and another seems to be a very small evil.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will simply be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went downtown, we went with the kids to the carousel in the Central Park, the biggest carousel in the New York Park Department, and the best way to spend three dollars in town if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are horrific and huge, the pictures of the glass on the central drum, the horrifying clowns and the animals, who look in horror at their back, are extremely vicious, and the dazzling music, however strange, leads to the east.
So many things that are known in this city are disappointed: the species of skyscrapers are getting older, the silhouettes of buildings are too good to cause a trepidation, and the reality of the city is not successful.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still worried about the day I found out that the Swisscottage area is actually not a Swiss joke (thematic pub "Ye Old Swiss Cottage" not an account) but a big round crossing in Northern London.
And carousel in the Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a two-year-old child, a eleven-year-old child and two forty women can have a great time.
If I could put the carousel score, I would put the five, but fortunately, nobody asked me for it.
And in the universe this week, I was asked before I had a terminal card, to evaluate my "expert" shopping experience on a scale of between one and five stars.
In the corner of my street, the same thing plus the option of accompanying a 15 per cent assessment of tea is a stand order.
As a result, not only does it slow down the neutrality of the idea of interaction, but it still requires a personal attitude towards a situation that does not require it.
The poor retailer in the universe smiled confusedly until I was able to evaluate my experience of handing her a credit card to five stars.
Oscar Pistorios was transferred from prison to a hospital because of chest pain
Pistorius is leaving prison for a doctor's visit for the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital for the treatment of wrist cuts, which, according to the prison administration, he received as a result of his fall into the chamber.
Pistorius was convicted of intentional murder after the prosecution's appeal for an initial conviction for unintended murder.
He killed Steinkamp early in the morning of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting her several times through the door of the toilet in his Pretoria house.
Pistorius said that he had taken his friend for the night gate hiding in his bathroom.
The Prosecutor ' s Office stated its intention to bring another protest, this time against the six-year period of Pretoria, which she said was too soft.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office stated that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal would be examined this year.
The time limit for Pretoriaus may be increased by 15 years if the Public Prosecutor's Office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
A non-exit signature has been chosen by the suspected journalist in the attack
The capital law enforcement officers chose the measure of repression in the form of a non-exit signature for a man who attacked the TV journalist Nikita Razvozaev during the direct ere of the park on 2 August.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the IMF, Irina Volk.
“In the context of the investigation of the criminal case initiated under article 116 of the Code of Conduct concerning a 32-year-old man who hit a correspondent in the Central Park of Culture and the rest of the name of the Gorgo, the suspect chose the measure of repression in the form of a refusal to leave and proper conduct,” Volk explained.
The representative of the TIRExB added that the suspect had been subject to an administrative protocol for police misconduct.
On Wednesday, 2 August, during the direct eve of the VDV Day to the correspondent, an alarming man came and hit the face.
As it turned out later, the huligan had no relation to VAT.
According to Razvozaev, dissidents, on the contrary, tried to hold the mosquito.
Two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent stand
According to the Bi-Ti-Vi television channel, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarians were detained in Greece for illegal shelter.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of people who had placed tents in an uninhabited location, including two Bulgarians, were detained in Sitonia.
They were released on the same day, while the investigation was still under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the Bi-Ti-Vi television channel that Bulgarian citizens were then released.
The Greek authorities have stepped up the control of the free camp and have already imposed serious fines on anyone who is caught while standing in a place that is not intended for that place.
Checks will be carried out throughout the entire season.
According to the Ministry, the court may appoint a fine.
The Russian MID accused the U.S. Vice-President of the rhetoric of the Cold War
Statements made during the U.S. Vice-President Michael Pens' European tour were criticized by the Russian MIDI.
“Unfortunately, Washington is becoming increasingly vulnerable to the primitive ideologicalized prints of the cold war, which are completely depleted from reality,” says the Russian Foreign Office.
Thus, in MIDI, they responded to the words of Pensa on the "Russian threat" and the attempts of the violent crossing of the borders in Podgorica.
The Russian MID pointed to the destructiveness of choosing either "with the West or with Russia" and the inconsistency of the alleged unalterable entry of all South-Eastern Europe into NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law by applying force to expel Kosovo from Serbia and thus creating another spark of tension.
“We call on US colleagues to stop the helm of Russia and its foreign policy line, which is constantly based on respect for partners and willingness to work together constructively, taking into account each other’s interests,” says the Russian MIDI.
Feldsher suffered in DTP with "almost" in Podmoskovya
The DTP occurred in the Sub-Moscow Stupino, resulting in a collision of the anomalies with the "Quick Help" car.
Today about 08:10 msk occurred a collision of the Mitsubishi car with a ambulance in the city of Stupino Moscow area.
“As a result of the crash of the “almost” machine,” TASS said in the press service of the GU MVD in Moscow.
On the DTP site, law enforcement officers are working to determine the circumstances of the incident.
In the Odessa area, a woman threw herself into the building of her newborn son, turning into a cellophan package.
On the evening of 3 August, the Department of Police reported to the local resident that he had found a package with a baby in an unconquered private house.
“At the scene, law enforcement officers and doctors who quickly brought the child to a medical facility reported in the Odesh Head of the National Police.
The doctors found that the boy was born a few hours before his discovery, as evidenced by the presence of the populace.
During the priority operational follow-up activities, the identity of the birth was established as a 36-year-old local resident.
It has also been established that a woman has three other minor children.
As noted in the chapter, the family did not fall into the field of family law enforcement before and did not take special account.
Police are currently setting out the circumstances and reasons that have prompted a woman to do this, after which a procedural decision will be taken.
Now the baby is under the supervision of the doctor.
As previously reported, a 21-year-old woman in Nikolai threw her unborn child into a garbage dump.
Gregory Leeps: "I'm going to fight, though 55 is not 30."
One of the most successful artists of the Russian Estrada, Gregory Leps, celebrates his 55th birthday on the next Sunday.
Before the feast, the singer talked to the informant.
I remember what your "cold" was like.
A special tent in the Lies, Gloria Gainor sings for the nominee, a powerful salad over the Moscow River.
You must have been wondering if you'd like to spend your next five years.
Have you thought about it?
As far as the profession is concerned, it was a good time.
I worked a lot, went through the country with gastronomy three times, gave 120-130 concerts a year.
He released two bad albums.
Of course, I'm not what I said 20 years ago.
Biological times don't cheat.
Singing like I sang in my 30s is getting harder and harder.
Still, I'm going to fight. I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm going out on a different level.
You and the new album, the first in three years.
Yeah, work on him now.
Actually, we've all recorded it in my studio, and now we're going to send it to Los Angeles.
It's called "What are you so serious?" in a single song written together with Timothy.
She's not ready yet, so we haven't told her yet.
We'll do it later when the clip is taken.
And the album will be presented in November to a series of my anniversary concerts in Moscow's Crocus City Hall.
A classic American drummer Chris Coleman put his hand on your new bottle.
Do you think you wanted to attract him to your gastronomy?
In my opinion, Colman today is one of the most outstanding drummers in the world.
He came to my studio, recorded his parties.
I invited him to join my group, and Jeremy Colson (a well-known drummer involved in various projects.
But for long-term work in Russia, they raised, in a mild way, excessive conditions.
It was about fees from €35,000 to €45,000 per month.
At that time, I thought that in the post-Soviet space, I would also find worthy musicians.
And he found a great drummer Max Malashev.
It is better to feed ourselves.
In time, I want to say good-bye to any of them, not for anything.
For example, the guitarist Fedor Dossumov is ranked high at the international level.
Western music magazines are about him, and he's invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wey, after listening to his game, said that "a new generation of guitarists came, with another executive technique."
Your album is in Los Angeles, American musicians are working with you, but you still can't come to the United States yourself?
Are you trying to get rid of this ban?
Now, honestly, I'm not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers who are dealing with this issue.
As a musician, I'm really sorry that I can't get to America.
I never said I was learning.
The more you communicate with these professionals, the more useful you are.
We're not dumber than them, but we don't have that kind of experience, school.
In front of our performers of popular music for 70 years, the challenges that American musicians have always faced have not been fully met.
They sought the highest quality sound.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now why the United Kingdom refused to join me for ten years.
But every year, I'm going to submit visa papers to the British Embassy to allow me to go there again, and the most important thing is to work there.
The rest of Europe is kind to me.
And in August, you're planning a concert in Monaco, not a contract, but a poster, right?
Yeah, Monte Carlo's got a good sports room. I've been there before.
Now they've been invited back, and, as far as I know, all the tickets to the concert have already been sold.
You're gonna go to "Randevo Lyma Wikula," which will start in Jurmala on July 20th, right?
She invited me, and, of course, I answered.
Lima is an amazing singer and a wonderful woman who is able to give herself both a beautiful vocal and even a whisper.
After the gastrolls and the jubilee concerts, as far as I know, you want to address the creation of Vladimir High.
You already have two albums with his songs in your disc picture.
When will the third come out?
Probably next year.
But it'll be completely different.
I want to write about 80-90 songs of the High One in about the same song as he did himself.
Just the voice and the guitar.
No other arrangement.
I'll be accompanied by our famous musician, Timour Wedernik.
I'll try to get myself involved in the album and Alexander Jakovlević Rosenbaum.
I talked to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's busy, so let's see how it works.
You and Boris Grebenščić's songs were gradually introduced to his repertoire.
Maybe you'll write his stuff later?
Boris Borisovic is a wonderful man and a great musician.
So I went through with him a few times and asked, "Can I sing some of his songs?
He said, "Grygorie, I'm writing songs so they can be fulfilled."
Please try, let's go.
It's probably interesting to write such an album.
As long as I don't have a job like this, but in the future, two years, if Boris Borisovic doesn't mind, I might be doing that.
If you don't focus fully on your manufacturing center.
I guess until you realized his potential, didn't you sign contracts with all the artists you care about?
There are a number of performers I'd like to have under my wing, but they're independent, they're people.
You mean Sergei Lazaruserev?
Serjea is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I can't agree with his repertoire, but he also has his development strategy.
And in my center now is Alexander Panayotov, whom I took to the Volos.
We've made a deal with him and we're working.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It would be a great pity if he did not reach the heights he deserved.
I'm trying to improve his repertoire, I'm shooting videos.
I hope for a good result.
I also try to promote other artists in my center: I buy them songs, I cry to poets, sometimes their tracks fall into the rotation of television and radio channels.
If they do not reach high altitudes, I will still lead our cooperation to logical completion.
They'll get a written album on the way out, a couple of videos.
And then, if they want, they can go their way, and I'm not going to force them to return their money.
Although I would be pleased if any of them would succeed and pay me the percentages we had agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not going to cover the oxygen.
Let everyone work, break through, prove as I once did.
If tomorrow you're invited to a gastronomic tour of Ukraine and they guarantee entry into the country, will you go?
I'm still invited there.
The main thing is that there are private activities.
And as for the big tour...
I was, in my own opinion, a Russian man flying to Syria on the same plane that broke down.
If they say tomorrow they have to fly to some other point for the sake of the State, I'll take it.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics think about me.
I am sincerely sorry that we have had such a situation with Ukraine.
Because I think we're one people and we have to be together.
I regret that this is not going to happen at least in the near future.
I used to give 40-50 concerts a year in Ukraine.
We've met somewhere.
Thank you very much.
And he worked with several Ukrainian artists: Annie Lorak, St. Lloyd, Artem Loick...
In Ukraine, the masses of gifted people, and sincerely regret that they cannot now give their talent to a large Russian audience.
Music must unite and entertain people.
I would be pleased to invite some classic Ukrainian performer to Russia, such as Slavu Vakarchuk, and to have a concert with him.
But I think it's unlikely right now...
Andrea Ochlopkova was transferred with cosmodrom
As "U", the technical director of the cosmodroma, East Andrei Ohlopkov, has begun work at the State Space Science and Production Centre (HCNPC) on behalf of Hruniceva.
He had previously de facto been involved in the construction of the East cosmodrom, but because of disagreements with the management of the Centre for the Exploitation of Land and Space Infrastructure (CENKI), he had been transferred to a Moscow Philly company where he would coordinate production.
Mr. Ohlopkov will not have a replacement: the post of Technical Director will probably be cancelled and the staff will be disbanded by CENKI units.
The technical director of the East and Deputy Director of CENCI for technological development Andrey Ohlopkov moved to work on behalf of the Hruniceva GNPC, "U" told top managers of several space industry enterprises, as well as government equipment.
"He's been working on a new post for a few weeks," the interviewers said, "U" in the industry.
An operational comment from CENKI was not received on Thursday, and Mr. Ohlopkov himself was not available for comments.
However, the information “U” has been officially confirmed in the CCNPC.
He decided to move to the position of Production Coordination Director - they said - Andrey Ochlopkov was fully committed to ensuring a minimum for the first launch of the spacecraft.
Mr. Ohlopkov moved to CENKI in 2013, with his shoulders serving in space forces, in particular in Baykonour, and in Plesecke, he served as the first Deputy Commander in the "north" cosmodrome.
In 2009, Andrey Ohlopkov became a criminal figure.
The result was that he was accused of bribery: it was alleged that from his submission, regional traders had received pledges but had failed to meet the commitments made to clean the separate parts of missiles in the Archangelian area and the Republic of the Commission.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
The CENCI responsibilities for technological development were extended to various projects, but the main of them was the construction of a cosmodrom in the Far East.
The then head of the Federal Space Agency, Oleg Ostapenko, in an interview “U”, directly said that the situation in the East “was critical already in October 2013”.
The fact that there was a strategic error in planning: the completion of the construction and the launch of the first “Union-2.1” rocket was planned at the same time as at the end of 2015.
In order to complete the opening by the end of the year, the completion of the construction was decided six months earlier and the deadlines were postponed from December to July 2015.
In order to speed up the process, CENCI specialists began to operate a parallel installation of technological equipment on unfurnished facilities.
Andrei Ohlopkov was the main supporter of this idea.
Despite the risks and still the transfer (in place of December 2015 "the Union" fled only on 28 April 2016), the idea justified itself, the source of "U" on the cosmodrome said, " Otherwise we would not have made any exits from the East yet, but would have done the construction."
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who was driving the creation of a cosmodrom, called Andrea Ohlopkov his "spatial Susanine" in a joke, but he almost always asked for information about the state of the building.
Mr. Ohlopkov and directness recalled: for example, in the interview “U” he suggested that the Federal Special Construction Agency (Spectro) be removed from the status of the only East Executive and work directly with subcontractors: “Why should we all lay eggs in one Spectro basket?”
This idea was supported by the Government.
Since 2017, CENCI has assumed the responsibility of the General Contractor to complete the construction work at the start and technical complex for the fourth quarter.
According to “U”, Mr. Ohlopkov's shift to a new place of work has led to disagreements with CENCI's management on how to complete the construction of spacecraft facilities and complexes, as well as working methods with subcontracting organizations.
“It was decided that this would be best for everyone,” says one of the top managers involved in the East.
In turn, the Government staff member calls the decision strange: "He was one of the best professionals, finding an equal replacement for him would be difficult."
According to “U”, this will not be necessary: the position of the technical director of the cosmodrom will be abolished and its functions will be disbanded by CENCI units.
In music schools, there will be a programme for two specializations
In the future, students of children's music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to the director of the Department of Science and Education of the Minkulture of St. Julubenko, repeated disciplines can be re-readed to students, and the issue of the payment of other specialization courses to be decided by special grants is referred to as "RIA Novosti".
“The Ministry of Culture has taken over this issue, and we are working together with the expert community on a mechanism that will enable two specialties to be implemented, but at the same time will not be contrary to the current legislation in the field of education,” Gulubenko said.
Last Friday during the "Non-Children's Talk" by Vladimir Putin and the educators at the "Syrian" Children's Centre, the student Maria Andreyeva reported that recurrent items had to be paid for in the second specialty at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl told me that she was studying at the violin and piano class and had prizes in both directions.
The Head of State recognized the issue as very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian is detained on a wall
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian named Kirill N., who was reported on the roof of the tall building, reported the El Universal portal.
The incident occurred in the capital of Mexico.
The young man, with the help of two unknown men, moved through the three-metre collection to the territory of Nestle's office building complex and took it to one of his own pools.
However, he did not use any special equipment, insurance and chains.
A young man has been detained on the roof.
The staff of the Ministry of Public Security put him on the ground on the helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Institute of Migration.
It shows whether a young person is legally in the country.
In the meantime, the video with a young high school student has become popular in the Network.
The users called the young man a spider.
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can help to facilitate CSFs.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your food tract.
But recent studies have suggested that diet, rich in meat proteins and dairy products, can help to relieve the symptoms of those who suffer from inflammatory diseases.
This incurable disease, which affects some 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, leads to the loss of life, chronic or bloody pride, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Usually, to relieve the symptoms, the patient is advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers from Washington University found that the main amino acids of the triptophan protein contribute to the production of immune cells that increase the tolerability of the caterpillar.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the bladder are monitoring that harmful microbes from food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of starting the combustion process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body and that do not harm sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too severe to burn, it can lead to inflammatory diseases of the bladder.
Experiments have shown that a mouse with a certain bacterium in the bladder has an increased cell tolerance.
And this bacterium needs a triptophan, one of the building elements of the protein, to start the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is part of the normal microbial bladder, and the development of the population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more triptophans were fed by mice, the more immune cells they had."
He assumed that the same would work for people: a combination of L. Reuteri and a rich diet triptophan can contribute to a more tolerant and less prone to the burning of the environment in the sink.
Dr. Luiz Servantes-Barraganvas' post-doctoral study of the diversity of immune cell tolerance found that one group of mice had these cells and another group that belonged to the same line, but contained them separately, did not have them.
She assumed that the difference could be caused by microbial mice -- the communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA of the mouse was sequenced, and six types of bacteria were found in mice with immune cells but not in mice with no mice.
The mice that grew in the sterile environment, which did not have good microbial and did not develop these types of immune cells, received L. reuteri, and the immune cells appeared.
In order to understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers raised L. Reuteri in a liquid environment and then transferred small portions of fluid - without bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells separated from the mouse.
Immune cells have become cells that increase tolerance.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a side product of triptophan processing, known as indol-3-lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the number of triptophans in mouse food, the number of cells increased by about 50 per cent, but when the level of triptophans was reduced twice, the number of cells also dropped twice.
Dr. Servantes-Barragan explains that people have the same increasing tolerance of the cell as the mouse, and most of us have L. Reuters in their stomach tract.
It is not known whether the side products of L. reuteri triptophane contribute to the development of cells in humans as well as in mice, but in people with inflammatory diseases of the bladder, defects have been detected in the genes associated with the triptophane.
She said, "It is possible that we should strengthen the development of these cells, because these cells depend on the burning processes on the inside surface of the shells.
High levels of triptophans with L. reuteri may potentially increase their population.”
According to José Morinou, Manchester United hired geniuses in the face of Nemini Matić
Manchester United hired a genius in the face of Nemnini Matić, he thinks Jose Morinou after the semi-protector debuted in the match against "Sampora" on Wednesday night.
The game, acquired for 40 million pounds at Chelsea, began with the victory of 2-1 in Dublin in the last pre-season match United before the UEFA SuperCube against Real Madrid on Thursday, and impressed the role of a semi-protector, while players such as Pola Pogba and Andreas Pereira broke up when they were judged.
However, since Matic did not take part in the pre-season Chelsea tour in Asia, he was not seriously prepared for the game, and he lasted only 45 minutes, which Moorin said required preparation before the start of the premier league season.
"He needs time, but his experience, mind, genius is what he thinks he thinks is football," said Maurina.
“We will help prepare him sooner than later.”
Like Matic, his new players, Victor Lindeloff and Romel Lukaku, started the game at the Aviva Stadium when Maurina began to form her main composition for the beginning of the next season.
The Independent newspaper reported this week that Maureen wanted to hire three more players, but suggested that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he wanted to hire first.
He added, "I am grateful to the club for having won three out of four."
“I’m more happy if they get me four of the four, but they’ve done a lot for me.”
Former Lithuanian Social Democrats' leaders advocate their stay in the ruling coalition
Former Presidents of the Socialist Party of Lithuania, former Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as former Speaker of the Social Democrats Cheslovas Yershenas, called on the parties to remain in the ruling coalition.
As the parliamentary newspaper reported, due to training with the Christian and Green Union partners, a discussion was initiated in the Social Democratic Party on whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
And here are three senior experienced partners who addressed one another with an open letter saying, inter alia, "Renewal of a party's disappointment with the election results, but the coalition with "Christians" has created for us an easy and not very easy condition for further implementation of the goals of social justice, which, on our own initiative, are provided for in the Government's programme, and for maintaining the political domination of the left-wing centre over the right-wing parties."
According to the former party leaders, the debate has so far “been emotionally motivated by the expression of opinion without specific arguments”.
The authors are afraid that unthinking action by their party may lead to political, economic and social instability in Lithuania.
A fine was imposed on disabled Anton Mamayev
Mosgorud has softened the punishment of disabled rider Anton Mamayev from four and a half years of imprisonment to a fine of 200 thousand.
Prior to the decision of the Timorese Court, the convicted person was released from SIS.
At the same time, Mosgordou confirmed that the accused was a criminal, as he had organized a robbery and kidnapping of a motorbike with the former specialist fighter.
By its decision, Mosgord reduced the punishment of Anton Mamayev to 200 thousand dollars of fine.
“Mamaev is an organizer of a robbery, which also constitutes a crime, and, accordingly, such a person should be held accountable,” explained Mosgorsud Ulyan Solopov, U.S. Press Secretary.
In this case, the court took into account Mamayeva ' s health status, the actual circumstances of the case, the absence of extenuating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied article 64 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which stipulates that a lower sentence may be imposed.
With regard to assistant Mamayev Vasilia Serostanov, the court did not establish the circumstances that would be the basis for a change in the severity of the sentence and a change in the sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself stated that he was not satisfied with Mosgorsud's decision.
I'm disappointed with the court's decision.
The only legal solution would be the justification for continuing to fight for justice.
His lawyer, Andrey Orlov, did not exclude the appeal of the sentence in the cassation of Mosgorsud and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all the tools until the European Court of Human Rights," he said.
Remember, 28-year-old Mosquito Anton Mamaev, who suffered from back muscle atrophy, was a criminal case last fall.
A disabled person claims to have bought a motorbike in a known area of 160 thousand rubles to sell.
However, the owners of the motorbike, including the former specialist fighter, said that the disabled person and his assistant, Vasili Serostanov, had chosen property from them, threatening to use violence.
On 30 June, the Timorese District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasilia Serostanov to three years in the colony, and Anton Mamayeva to four and a half years in prison with a general regime sentence (art.
After the displaced person had been placed in SISO, the Public Chamber, the Office of the Prosecutor of Human Rights, with President Tatian Moskalkov, joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July, Anton Mamaev was released from the SISA by the same decision of the Timorese Court.
The defence, in turn, regretted the decision of the first instance in Moscow.
The UNF will prepare a report on the environment for the President
The final "Forum of Action" of the All-Russian People's Front (ONF) in 2017 will address environmental issues, reported the "Reports" source to the ONF and confirmed the head of the Alexei Anisim movement.
He said that the “front” forum was planning to prepare a report to the President on the issues of national ecology and to propose a strategy for their solution.
The NFO interviewers note that the report of the Head of State will contain a “deep analysis” of the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to the Reports, the UNF final forum will be held in autumn.
The exact date of its implementation has not yet been defined, as a rule, is based on the President ' s schedule, who is the leader of the movement and is traditionally present in key activities of the UNF.
The front held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts in Rostov-Na-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirova.
The outcome will be a conference in the capital of the Republic of Hurricane Ulan-Ude.
On the basis of the proposals that have been made and will be made on these events, we are also making systematic proposals to address environmental problems, said the NFO Co-Chairman.
The Co-Chairman of the Olga Timofeev Movement, headed by the Committee on the Environment and the Environment, reported that the “frontovices” would report to the head of the State on the work carried out within the framework of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the UNF Forum of Action are likely to be reconciled.
Over the year, we have grown a strong team of environmental experts, seen gaps in legislation, stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All this will be reflected in the report that we are preparing for the President as the leader of our movement.
In addition, the “front” reports also on the work on the UNF priority projects,” said Olga Timofeev's “Reports”.
She said that a special representative of the Head of State for Environmental Action, Environment and Transport, Sergey Ivanov, would be invited to the forum.
He had already participated in the work of the UNF Media Forum, which was held in St. Petersburg in April.
A few months later, the Year of Ecology will go back to history, and the most important thing to do today is to start environmental mechanisms for them to work for years.
To prevent these issues from coming out of the agenda, Olga Timofeev added.
The head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Institute of Social Research (EISI) Andrey Koladine noted: In raising the environmental issue, the UNF is taking the lead in the presidential agenda.
Many things they as experts offered in various forums, and these initiatives received the President's support, said Andrey Koladine to the News.
He stressed that the economic capacity of the environmental agenda could not be excluded to date, which could give further impetus to the regions for development.
Furthermore, the UNF regions will be able to improve not only the solution of their environmental problems but also the development of ecotourism, added the expert.
The relevance of the environmental issue was demonstrated by the "direct line" with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, questions were asked to the President about the waste disposal in Balashi (already closed) and about carbon dust in the port of Nadaka (a bill on the prohibition of open coal spills in human settlements, one of the authors of Olga Timofiev) had already been drafted.
Environmental experts believe that the legal framework for addressing environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been established, that the issue is in further law enforcement and that civil society is at stake.
A clear implementation of the decisions taken by the State is deemed to be the head of the Ecology for All Fund, Leonid Bochin.
A member of the SPC, Head of the non-governmental organization Greens Russia, Sergey Chiplenkov, in his discussion with the Reports, stressed that successful solutions to environmental problems require a responsible approach to society and business, some legislative efforts.
As soon as society and business realize that the solution to environmental problems is a much more strategic step, the situation will change, Sergei Chiplenkov noted.
The expert stressed that there was a need to break the trend that the violation of environmental legislation was an economically beneficial solution for business.
A British inventor used a microchip to fall into a house and a hand - shaped machine
The British inventor became the first person in the country to be set up by a microchip so that he could open the door to his home, enter the office, and even drive a car with a simple handcuff.
Thirty-three-year-old Steven Nortem used a tiny chip between large and indicative fingers and now, through his BioTek company, offers this service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives for technology.
He joined Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist from the Royal Council in Winchester, in order to ensure that the exercise procedure was conducted in accordance with medical standards.
Technology is similar to a microchip that feeds cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Nortema also replaces locks in houses and machines with a price chip of 300 pounds per lock.
The father of one child has already established technology in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which is made when his hand is on the wheel.
The requirement for the White House went to taxpayers in thousands of dollars
According to the Time magazine, the White House's decision last month to push a seabed helicopter into the South Ossuary for an event dedicated to American industrial production was $24,000 to taxpayers.
The White Green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as the Marine One, when the President is on board, has become the central element of the event held in the White House on 17 July, in which American construction programmes have been demonstrated.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pens and senior White House officials have examined technology products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, manufactured in Connecticut, was exposed by a man-state hunter, a Wisconsin fire truck, and a Mississippi truck.
According to the records of the First Marine Helicopter Squad (HMX-1), the division responsible for the helicopter management, the Military Office of the White House arranged for the presence of the helicopter in a private order, or “FRAGO”, only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the southern shelf in the event of an “unusual” event.
“I just want you to make sure that you are in the course, because this is an unusually widespread event in the press,” said Commander HMX-1 in an electronic letter to his chief, the first Deputy Head of the Marine Corps Air Force, for the first time.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the South Shore about 7 a.m. on 17 July to participate in the three-day event, and would remain there until the lawn would be released between 6 and 9 evenings on the same day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second flight crew will be required in accordance with hours of work.
The first crew escorted the helicopter during the event and the security officers stayed close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
The records received by TIME remained unclear whether the second crew was required.
The Hetcha Act prohibits federal officials from using public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether it was contrary to this decision.
“ Among other things, we asked if it was a violation of Hetch’s law, and we said no,” the commander wrote.
“You don’t seem to be getting along,” said the deputy chief.
The event was announced by the White House as an official event and the Hetch Act did not apply to it.
But even official activities have political notes.
During the event, the President made efforts to promote the health reform that was then under way in the Senate and commended efforts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
The Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But it's unusual to ask them for a photo only.
Trump had already been discussed in February when the Presidential plane was on the ground at his first pre-election meeting in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account had been interrupted by complaints about the use of the Presidential plane by his predecessor.
“The White House in the East from the show “Secret in America”, which presented products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials,” said the Vice-Secretary of the White House, Lindsey Walters.
The HMX-1 teams often operate training flights around the Washington Aglomeration and at the South Staff to train the transportation of the President of the United States to the White House with an accuracy of up to a inch.
When Trump was at the G-20 in Germany in early July, HMX-1 held 58 training sessions at the White House.
According to one official, a flight carried out for the event “Done in America” was counted against the necessary training flights per month.
The unit's helicopters that day also met 11 additional hours in the context of “non-presidency support challenges”.
According to the White House, taxpayers were not charged any of the other exhibits present at the event.
The representative of Sikorsky reported that the company had not participated in the demonstration of the helicopter in the South Lugansk.
HMX-1 does not take into account the budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
However, according to the time-limits of the Ministry of Defence for 2017 fiscal year, the refund rate of the Ministry of Defence for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight.
The unit ' s records indicate that the flight time in the air was 30 minutes on each side of its airfield based on the Quantico Marine Aviation Base in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real value of the helicopter is much lower than that rate.
“To calculate the value for taxpayers, based on the approximate rate of reimbursement, totally wrong,” says Walters.
“These exemplary rates include personal composition, servicing and many other non-turnable costs that are included in the annual allocations”.
According to a study conducted by REND in 2015, reimbursement rates do not include the cost of the personal composition, but indeed take into account the cost of fuel, services and costs specified in the contract.
At that time, the former White House Press Secretary, Sean Spaiser, spoke for the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to demonstrate things done in America this week,” Spaiser said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that they exist, I suppose, hundreds, if not thousands of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we're all proud of this helicopter and other military technology that so many Americans have been constantly working on.
That is why, of course, it is entirely appropriate to draw that attention.”
It was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter, watching the South Shore during the event, but he was sitting right in the driver's seat in the fire car.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky's representatives, respecting the press on his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president. "I have three of them."
Moscow will grant grants to urban hospital rehabilitation offices
The Life Saving Grants will be awarded annually to the reanimation and offices of intensive treatment of capital clinics.
The funds will be used to promote doctors and nurses.
The mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobianin, visited the City Hospital of Judah.
During his examination of the clinic, he handed a thank-you letter to the orthopedic physician Victor Procko, under whose guidance the most complex operation was carried out to reconstruct the adolescent's stage.
Sergei Sobianin also told of the decision to reanimate the city clinic's intensive care facilities annually.
The funds will be directed towards the promotion of doctors and nurses.
According to the mayor, the hospital of Judah is today one of the largest hospitals in Moscow.
In recent years, modern equipment has been introduced to the clinic to allow doctors to carry out unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the basis of the Colomen Village Hospital.
Currently, the medical offices are expected to receive more than a thousand patients.
In addition to reanimation and stationery, there are daily offices.
The hospital staff has 2,800 staff.
The total area of the clinic is 23.7 ha.
In February of this year, health care has become a participant in the pilot project for the organization of short-term accommodation stations (SPS).
They are intended for relatively small operations.
The surgical intervention process uses advanced medical equipment to significantly reduce the period of rehabilitation of patients.
After the operation at the station, they spend only a few hours.
In the first half of the current year alone, 36,000 patients were provided with steady-state medical care in a clinical hospital called Judine.
Medical staff have carried out 15,800 operations of varying degrees of complexity.
NBU reported the lack of Ukrainian “daughter” buyers Sberbank
In the Nazbanke Ukraine (NBU), there were no applications for the purchase of Sberbank's Ukrainian daughter.
On Friday, 4 August, the TASS reported on this subject with reference to an NGO press representative.
NBU confirms that on 3 August 2017, a package of documents from Belarus and Cyprus, Viktor Prokopani, to agree on the acquisition of 100 per cent of Sberbank shares by the central bank, was withdrawn.
“No documents were received from other potential investors for the purchase of Sberbank shares in the NBU”, notes the Communication.
On 3 August, the Belarusian businessman Victor Prokopenja withdrew the application for the purchase of Sberbank ' s subsidiary.
On 28 July, it was known that Nazbank Ukraine had refused to purchase Sberbank's Ukrainian daughter, Said Güzeriev and Gregory Guselnik, to Russian businessmen.
The regulator justified its decision that businessmen did not provide the necessary documents to verify their compliance with the requirements of Ukrainian legislation.
Sberbank reported on the sale of its Ukrainian daughter to the Norvik Banka consortium and the private Belarusian company in March of this year.
The majority shareholder of the consortium was Said Guceriev, son of the Russian businessman Mikhail Guceriev.
Sanctions against the “daughter” of five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were introduced in mid-March.
During the year, they were prohibited from withdrawing capital from the country for the benefit of mother organizations.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, stated in the UN.
Elections can be representative only if all members of society, including women, are involved.
According to Nicholas Heissoma, the head of the UN mission to support Afghanistan, hundreds of women are in the provincial councils, three women are in the position of Vice-President, and more than 30 per cent of the re-registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in his statement on Wednesday.
The choice can be fully representative only if women participate fully and are included at all stages of the electoral process.
Elections to the provincial and presidential councils will take place in Afghanistan on 5 April.
The Taliban is threatening to disrupt the electoral process that coincides with the transition of international forces from military operations to the role of advisers.
In this year's elections, for the first time, power has passed peacefully from one democratically elected Government to another.
Hayes said that increasing the role of women would contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, a total of 3.6 million registered voters are 1.2 million women.

Electricity saves both for the residents and for the manufacturers of the storm
The long-standing efforts of the Soviet and Post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Burma (East Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity users have begun to bear fruit.
From 1 September to 25 per cent, the cost of electricity is reduced by low voltage for industrial recipients.
The Federal Antitrust Service of the country, in accordance with the Government of the Republic of Russia ' s Decision on the amendment of the Regulation on the Optimal Market of Electricity and Power and on the combined forecast balance of electricity production and supply (power) within the framework of the Russian Single Energy System for the Subjects of the Russian Federation (No. 842) has established indicative prices for electricity and power for industrial users of the Republic of Buratia.
As a result, the cost of electricity for stormy goods producers is reduced to a fourth, which will make life much easier for small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the leaders of the republics have pursued the thresholds of Moscow's cabinets in a futile attempt to compare the region at tariffs with the nearby Irkutsk area with the cascade of hydro power stations in Ankara, from the Baykala, the main water collection territory for which Buratia is located.
And it was only this year that movement began.
In March, electricity tariffs for the Republic ' s population fell from 4.24 rubles/kWt to 3.93 rubles/kWt, or 7.3 per cent.
With the inclusion of the Bouratiya on a federal government decision in the List of Price Areas of the Opportunity Market, for which the characteristics of the operation of the Opportunity and Different Markets have been established among industrial consumers.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, as the Irkutian population pays for a kilowatt/hour of 1.11 rubles.
But no one dares to mention at least the approximate date of the new tariff movements towards the downturn for the Storm.

National Trade Union of Unskilled, Municipal and Retired Workers (GMB) is concerned about investment in McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The trade union requires guarantees from the managers of McVitie's cookie manufacturer due to his long-term obligation to produce at the plant in Glasgow.
The Scottish office of GMB reports that the company has been silent about the future investment at the Tolcross facility.
The factory, which produces, among other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, owner of McVitie's, reports that over the past few years, it has invested more than 5 million pounds in the facility.
The company adds that in the case of any change in the work of the facility, staff and representatives of the trade union “are the first to know”.
In a letter to the head of the facility belonging to the company, the Scottish GMB office requested McVitie's response to concern that funding would not be allowed to modernize production lines.
Senior organizer Drew Daffy said: “Our trade union members are deeply concerned that we cannot obtain clarity from the head of the facility on business needs and investment plan regarding the future of Tolcross”.
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers in local society and in the territory of the Greater Glasgow; this is the most important pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social depression.
Thus, from the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and at the back of Brexit, the growth of the living minimum and the chronic decline of production, East-End Glazgo desperately needs to flourish at McVitie's factory.
According to the representative of Pladis, “The Head of the Tolkros facility only received a letter yesterday from the Scottish office of GMB, and the company will respond immediately, as we appreciate our continued cooperation with staff and representatives of the trade union”.
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting in Tolcross with GMB staff and representatives, which discussed a number of issues openly.
We have talked to staff that, like all companies working under the most competitive and unstable economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our actions – and this concerns all our facilities and activities – to remain competitive.
“In recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our tolcrosis facility, especially in production lines and improvement of functional indicators.”
We are fully aware of the value of Tolkross as a production facility, and in the case of any change in the work at the facility, the staff and representatives of the trade union will be the first to know about it.”
Putin said the authorities would not give direction to Rosnefti and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin said that the supply of gas to the Eastern Petroleum Company (WNHC) should be linked to the Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers, but the Gazprom instructions, like Rosnefti, would not be given.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, responded to Igor Sechin's request to help resolve the conflicts.
The Head of State drew attention to the fact that relations between Rosneft and Gazprom had to be resolved solely on the basis of market principles.
Previous chapter, Rosnefti, Igor Sechin, at the meeting on major investment projects in the Far East, stated that the absence of an agreement with Gazprom on gas for WNCH threatened the implementation of the project.
The case noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue continued.
Gazprom proposes to find gas resources from the Rosnefti perimeter, but we don't have such resources," added Sečin.
Remember that Rosnefte has requested permission to use it for the East Oil Company gas from the Kirin district of Gazprom, located on the Shelf of Sahalin.
In June, Gazprom stated that negotiations on this issue continue, and “no sharp corners”.
Did the Barcelona PZJ warn of Naimar's transition three years ago?
A member of the La League may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
The couple of Saint-German will not stop chasing Neimar after the club has offered £ 189 million for his ransom, but have they warned Barcelona about a three-year-old world record?
The sensational proposal revived the summer transfer window, when League 1 was ready to hit the world record of the transition, more than twice the previous mark related to the return of the Pogba Field to Manchester United in the last 89 million pounds season.
When the transition is over, Neimar will become the most expensive player in the world, as well as the most highly paid professional athlete in the world, as the GSP offers him over £500,000 per week clean.
It is well known that Barcelona is angry with the way the proposal was made and how Neimar broke the contract, despite the fact that, as a source close to the leadership of the Catalan club, the club has always done everything possible for the game since its transition from Santos in 2013.
But wasn't the football world warned about such a possibility three years ago by the president of the PZP?
When Manchester City expressed interest in the rental of Blaez Matthewidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Helaifi issued a strong warning to any club that wanted to deceive one of the best players in the PZP.
“I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our games, then we will fight them, we will make offers to their players.”
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to catch one of our games, their consequences are inevitable."
According to all, Barcelona crossed this line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed interest in the semi-protection from the PZP Marco Verratti.
“PES” has indicated that the Italian game will not be allowed to collect under any conditions, and Barcelona is now likely to feel the effects of its proposal in the form of the loss of one of its most valuable players, Neimar.

Then they showed the boys in the open room next to the container they had prepared for the divorce.
Putin first let a few boys out of the bag.
Then he slammed for a special rig on the cover of the container and released the others.
Also during his trip, the leader instructed him to deal with the environmental situation on the bicycle and build a road on the island of Olhon.
