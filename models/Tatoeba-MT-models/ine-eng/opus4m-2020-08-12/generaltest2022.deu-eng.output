The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the product....
I'm #PRS_ORG# Großkunde and so it's not a problem for me.
You only need a number or indication that I should accompany the package so that it can be traced by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# for €249 a few days ago.
Today it costs 179€.
I find this to be very annoying, frankly.
Do I have to cancel the order and re-order for the better price or is there any other option of credit?
I also think in principle that children should not be allowed to take on a parent role for their little siblings.
However, I find it also good for large brothers to take care of the little ones.
Take a look, take a look, help, bring the bottle, etc.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family with and are involved.
As long as they can be enough children themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 is working alone for the short time and it's OK for him, that's good.
You can determine for yourself whether this is appropriate for your children.
It's not like he's going to wake up K2 and go to sleep for hours.
Legally, it is likely to be questionable.
Maybe that's why the psychologist's statement is coming.
Because if something really happened like fire, invasion, earthquakes, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1, to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is, of course, your judgment ;)
Please help me find the title of a book!
I remember reading a Crime / Thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost all the action, but I don't want the title to fall apart anymore maybe someone here knows how to...
The story was about fear and to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal nurse commits suicide by overcrowding with food and going to his predators.
The case is taken by a commissioner who, after a brief investigation with his therapists, manages a clinic where he treats patients with fear.
The Commissioner has a small niche that also has a fear (before fire) and landed with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is commissioned to go to the site of the suicide and document the photos and place them on the Internet before any suicide.
In any event, it turns out that this therapist operates a type of underlying therapy group where patients are planted a chip, the brain is depressed by a fear center and the patients finally face their fears in the most extreme way.
(A woman jumps out of the window another one goes for death)
This fear is referred to in the book as "the fight".
At the end there was a big showdown at the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is the gross act I am quite sure that the book was written in the original by a French author/author.
If this action was known to someone or even to me someone could betray the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, well, I don't have the password for wlan available.
I need to contact my husband first.
But it can take a while.
What steps do I have to take?
Is it also possible to refer the price difference back?
Child, 4 J., splitter under the thumb
The child, four years old, has over the entire length of the wooden splitter under the thumbnail (outside).
Trying to pull him with a brush.
It's very hard to catch.
He didn't hit and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
It's going to be a doctor tomorrow.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Using the combination of digital decoder and sound module on a lead disc, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can therefore be incorporated into almost any loop of the track width H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm large "sugar pump" loudspeaker next to a sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, LokSound5 is a real multiprotocol decoder.
It controls the DCC data format as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 driving levels are as obvious as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoder is fully automatically logged into a suitable digital centre.
It controls all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom® can be read with appropriate centrals on the main track.
For centrals that only program the CVs of 1-255 there can be help registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 driving levels at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola® addresses enable the release of 16 functions.
An integrated programming mode also allows reprogramming with the honorable Control Unit 6021.
The M4-Protocol allows automatic registration of mfx® compatible centrals.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes the Marklin® brake strokes as well as the ZIMO® HLU brake command or the Lenz® ABC system.
It is also possible to brake with DCC brakes or with equal voltage.
In addition, it also stops with a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC pendant automatically enables the automatic pendant between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog equal and interchange cables.

Because of Omicron: Johnson wants to drive rejuvenation
Always new Omicron cases provide politics and science in Britain.
Therefore, by the age of nine, all qualified adults in England should receive an application.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to get ahead even faster in the face of the corona outbreaks in view of the rapid rise in Omicron numbers.
Every adult in England should be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
In addition, the British government will provide support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in the parts of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
One faced an emergency in the face of the Omicron variant, which is why the protection of the vaccine needs to be strengthened urgently, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of vaccine.
"Let's blow you up now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 other Omicron cases were recorded in the UK, which increased the total number to 3137.
Compared to today, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa

I'm the one that everyone imagines with proms
I sent out an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by mail.
I want to answer the e-mail.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I've Googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it's either a man or a woman.
**I don't know how to write the e-mail now.
Can someone help me?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want to keep any officials walking over the feet.
Conclusion: everyone should imagine himself with promontorys.
It's got 5 books on it.
Four of them go.
Only one I bought today isn't going
Apparently the chair had an unsightly lack of sales.
How else can such a pulse damage occur after 9 months ?
Only tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
But it's been working since then.
14 days no more.
So I always bought the last books on the website and then read it on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there was no more.
Now they are available again and I would like to add 2 chairs to your order and take this into account.
[CW] The feeling if I can't help.
Content Warning: I will write something detailed here about domestic violence.
I just have to write something from the soul.
I (21) come into contact with victims (and victims) of domestic violence more often for professional reasons.
A topic that really bothers me and unfortunately is too often that many victims are not able to help themselves or think we cannot help them.
I'm pretty sure we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in the conversation under four eyes, with the perpetrator far away from sight and hearing, I cannot reach all.
I do not know what the reason is, perhaps it is fear, fear of anxiety, fear of abandoning the usual social environment, fear of getting the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, partly even very close to the tears, is all worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to resort to violence.
Often I wish I could help myself anyway... I know I can't.
But it's never gonna make it any easier.
Please, always think that you are worth living without violence, that it is so incomprehensible.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What does the series refer to "League of Legends"?

Why are we looking forward to the two stocks already announced?
basketball Bundesliga: Derby Debakel der MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Youngster Johannes Patrick was engaged.
Again nothing: For the second time within not even three months the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said with a look back on the Pokal landing at Hakro Merlin's Crailsheim in early October: "We've got some anger in our stomach."
It then did not stand after the game - but again increased in view of the 61:72 (28:38) -down in the basketball Bundesliga.
When more than the naked result disappointed the way in which the performance took place.
A representative was called a statistics that expressed the whole dilemma: The three-quota was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all by young John Patrick) in saying and writing 31 attempts - even questions?
The answer John Patrick delivered: "After the victory at Tenerife we were simply not concentrated enough, and did not implement what we have trained".
That's to move the ball.
On the other hand, Sebastian Gleim responded: "A funny game to win for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people before."
Only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they came at their expense.
Not least because of BBL topscore T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led the game of his team.
"The best player I've ever trained," Gleim praised.
While in Patricks team the performers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed all over the line.
Only in the last quarter (2:15) the giants prevented a total debacle and reached up to eight points after they had already returned 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon came to twelve points.
Luckily, there's not much time left to hate.
Already on Wednesday (19:00) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, then also in Ludwigsburg up to 750 spectators.
We used to have another email address, but I changed it.

Always as from the egg: Max Raabe will be 59
He is able to inspire his audience with new interpretations of beatings from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on his way with the program "Good Day, Dear Happiness" - if he can perform.
Actually Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But it won't work.
The concert planned was moved in May 2022 - "on official instructions", to stop the Corona virus.
Other of his performances planned in the adventure time must only fail once, as is the case on the website of the singer who becomes 59 today, and his musician (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January on, artists will then want to recapture their already 2020 dates due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalia Lünen, Max Raabe has already sung much and much as a youth.
In Berlin he studied opera songs, in 1986 he founded the Palace Orchestra together with Komilitons.
Since then, the Bariton has established itself with its repertoire of drummers and cansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was awarded many prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "For Women It's Not a Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
He made it out of the niche in the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair returned strictly and thought of labels, Max Raabe is no longer to be thought of from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good Day, Dear Happiness" he has been on tour. dpa since 2020
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small pattern of furniture wood in advance?
It will be added to existing furniture and so we could check beforehand whether it fits colour
It still doesn't work. I can't just see the cover but don't see leaves.
Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created by clothing
The new Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken against the property of large housing companies, as was required in a referendum in Berlin.
"A property does not produce any new apartment, it only changes ownership structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the "day mirror" (Sunday).
My goal is to assure tenants that their rent will remain payable in the coming years.
For example, a colourful mix of private owners, associations or housing companies is the best protection against monopolies.
In Berlin, the SPD, Greens and Left Party coalition will set up an expert commission to deal with the outcome of the People's Decision.
But if the situation does not relax, Geywitz will not shut down talks with the FDP directly in the light coalition about further reinforcements in the rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a lease price brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in stressed housing markets and the extension of the lease mirror.
I will speak to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician stressed.

At least 100 deaths from tornados in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, many tornadoes have been pulled by the United States.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 people could have complained.
The pictures from there remind you of a war zone.
On Saturday night, in the United States, several tornados have set up serious disasters and may have called for up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave about 320 kilometers long snowing of the desert, especially in the Member State of Kentucky.
His Governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the Tornado is through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial installations, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
He alone counts Kentucky with up to one hundred deaths in the Member State, with the official figures rising hourly.
Hi, I just saw that she sold out a bottle #NAME#.
That's very bad.
Will it still be produced?
Or is it taken out of the range?
Is it possible to order this glass in another country?
How long have you been reporting?
If delivery cannot take place in my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand, can I just order the blanket now and get it to Germany, which is in the basket?
I had given back an article or a return via the contact form and wanted to ask if it would be arrived or processed as I had not received confirmation.
Firms pay vaccine premiums and change advertisements
While the Federal Government continues to reject proposals for a vaccine premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and offer their employees money prizes.
Thus they are on a line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Economics who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The conversion of advertising logos to vaccine calls - after a German example - should also increase the willingness to use corona vaccines.
He's changed into a company he lied about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
Obviously, he did not find himself in his old place and sought something else.
You can do that, too.
And that he didn't like you at the time: well, it doesn't matter.
He didn't find his job well, either.
There are too many variables.
Please record the cancellation.
This will then be legally relevant.

Helping with First Own Campaign
Boron to the groove!
I direct for a group of 4 friends the adventure over the grab pass and want to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big bow is made to write the evil weights and their motivations, the individual act invented, and now I am writing the entrance note and stolving through my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes should bring a plant with cereals from gratenfels into a small village near the Thuran-see.
There is a need for further action.
A few miles away from the village, the heroes are to climb a group of Goblins and lure them into a backdrop.
I want to give the players the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: Convincing, acting, threatening to recognize the danger early, whatever happens to the players.
Group strength: 8 common goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and soles armed
In the absence of any comments, the Goblins march up to the heroes in a hole path and fling to each three left and right bows arm the vehicle while two with muscles stop the vehicle.
If it comes to fighting and the heroes are subject, I have two approaches
1. All the heroes are found unconscious and then found and healed by the son of the village school, a half.
Of course the carriage is gone.
2. Should a defeat be irrevocable just like this half with two of his servants and comes in to help the heroes in the struggle.
The car is still there, everything's great.
How do you maintain your Deus ex Machine of Solution 2?
Is the encounter too much as an entry into the adventure?
The Goblins group will later play a decisive role, so it is not only canon feed.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't count on so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will guarantee that many of your ideas will prevail and now have more confidence in my narrative.
I built the lamp again.
And shut up again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd like to send her back anyway.
Then if you can get the feedback back, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I'm generous with Sky Sport F1
Hello, dear F1 fans, over the season, the quality on the German Sky has increased, so I want to make some air with this post.
For the first time in the middle of the F2 race, the transmission was interrupted to start the F1 pre-repudiation on time.
Although due to the delayed start and the start of the schedule was far behind planning, you could still have shown the last ten (planned) minutes as well as the winning decision (!).
It seems, however, that for legal reasons the F1 has priority and must therefore restrict everything else, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, mostly Sky UK has transferred the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a small praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartys has accompanied the difficult situation of the serious accident well.
Then, in the F1, there was a rule of procedure with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that they could change the tires under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that the tires could change the tires when there were corresponding radios on this topic to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there was this possibility for walking.
I'm of the opinion that such elementary rules should simply be known when commenting on the F1 in a pay TV channel.
It is also not the first advice that is now possible or prescribed according to rules, both simply have constant uncertainty about rules.
Usually not like the artistic comment style of Roos, but give it the taste.
But then I really like even Heiko water from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant albernities that simply render them unprofessional, such as ordering coffee at (also unconscious) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Just the last one brings a lot of anxiety into the comment that he obviously does not take this seriously.
Not least, advertising just takes over at Sky, in which Sky is the only broadcaster who goes into advertising, as you can listen to F1TV, where only the German soundtrack has to come out without comment immediately after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two broadcasters in the trainings also make less advertising than Sky, and that as free TV broadcasters.
Even if you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not let me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very modest and full of repetitions.
In total, Sky is really the worst German-speaking transmitter that transfers the F1.
Unionically, RTL makes a better job of the four races that they can still pass on to the advertising.
So anyway, the grand F1 season makes much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I would be interested in your opinion.
On this: #PRS_ORG# pendulum lamp, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article which should be delivered last week and which is still not delivered.
I've contacted the chat twice and nothing so far.
The first lady told me it was being sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an e-mail and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of these has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Fan pumps are excellent for providing an additional aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air carriers.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
See the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the performance in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can run all the plants.
If you have a large aquarium you can use pumps with 2 or more exits so you can connect several outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model fan pump, but also offer to place an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (you can find at our shop) or with a decor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasured silence, a muscle or something.
The MK series has a special, soundproof construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump will be connected by a 4/6 mm air hose to an neutron, etc....and it can already be released.
The fan pump should be the same or higher as the water mirror and be applied outside.
If the fan pump is as deep as the water level, you should place a return valve between them.
Just cut through the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent water from running back and forth, which flows out of the basin through the pump...
If the air pump is applied freely, you should be covered and protected from moisture, as well as other air pumps.
The MK series pumps are clean power packages that consume little energy
Even if we specify here in ebay the processing time with 3 days, it will be packed daily and the packages will be picked up here every day.
Everything's going well, it's going very fast.
We only want to prevent a little so that no one is right, just because it has lasted a little longer.
It would be like this, not everyone has an understanding for all the employees who also work in the shipping system... of course here doesn't make a crown stand.
Please do not rate bad just because the delivery is delayed, it is only on the package services.
Of course, you'd like to joke about these services, even if we say at the moment, they've damned it hard.
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be evil to anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times.
How long does it take to order the yellow with and without the arm?

Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator to the worldall
The daughter of the first American in all, a TV moderator and four other passengers took a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of the company Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The launch and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the U.S. state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky Bezos took the freshly cut astronauts into his reception after their return.
"Welcome back," Bezos said, dressed in a blue robe when he opened the Luke to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers climbed out and hugged the Amazon founders.
According to Blue Origin, they were on their way 10 minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 NASA astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom Blue Origin's rocket system was named, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were honorists of the company, who had paid for their tickets by the other four passengers: Space Engineer Dylan Taylor, Investor Evan Dick, Technology Entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their ticket, Blue Origin didn't share.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered her father's mission after her short flight.
He has worked hard at his work and has to do everything himself.
She just flew along like that, said 74-year-old with a smile.
Michael Strahan too was excited.
He would like to return to everything again, the moderator said.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers high
The rocket system "New Shepard" is largely automated.
During the flight, the capsule separated from the rocket reached an altitude of about 100 kilometres above the earth, temporarily with no gravity, before the reusable object re-embarked from large parachutes again landed.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts see 100 kilometres across the earth as a border to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned all-out of Blue Origin: At the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
In October the second was the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who was world famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Deputy Chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics propose Bezos and Blue Origin to move the business with space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the well-being of mankind and without regard for the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and find the trade pretty exciting and also in the laboratory does not bother me (have already the inorganic chemistry practice behind me).
Of course, I had already been informed about career prospects before the study, but I still thought about the time I would like to study until promotion and I will.
But right now, I have doubts, especially of the job prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc.) you always hear super professional opportunities and the profession is totally sought, on the other hand you always hear about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
That's why I'd be really interested:
1) What are you working on right now?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/content?
3) What did you study/What training did you do?
4) Will you do all this again?
Thank you very much for your answers!
At the moment, I am really unsure and superior in 2022, perhaps to cancel the study and make a training to the specialist.
If you have experiences there, please write the following :)
Extra stress before holidays & holidays weekend
This topic came up to me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why it's only now.
Not only before big holidays, such as Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our business.
It seems there are also holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: last week was Marie Heavenly Travel, which is called "Aufahrt" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is why it is semi-official.
So last week there was a long 4-day weekend in the house.
So what went wrong last week?
Stress everywhere.
Louder e-mails that had to go before departure, order here order there, everything *unconditional* before the long weekend.
Weil... weil?
Because "next week then" sounds so much time and that shouldn't be?
Or because people want to do as much serious in a short week as in a normal week?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also very well-known.
What is this self-sacrifice for holidays?
Why, then, do we still have holidays if we cannot afford them properly?
The stress came not from the top, the colleagues were all so self-sufficient.
My question is simple: Are we the only Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) looks forward to Christmas in her Thuringian home - but still has no gifts.
"The beautiful, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, then you simply drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FPH.
They will agree to the party by backing up with their son and Bastele.
"I love that," Catterfeld said.
But until the smart days they still have something to do: "For the first time I haven't got any presents yet, I have to finally get rid of them."
NECTON-Bio supports a smooth running of the mouses and the pendulum retraining.
NECTON-Bio contains all vital vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg of biotin/kg.
NECTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny spring.
The majority of poultry damage occurring in the holding is due solely to nutritional errors.
Since the feed consists of a protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of an unused poultry.
For a functional metabolism, the daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most animal losses occurring during mice are based on poor or unbalanced protein supply and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NECTON-Bio, the adverse ratio of amino acids in most plant feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin preparation should be administered during use of NECTON-bio.
NECTON-Bio is cold water-soluble and can easily be administered via drinking water or soft feed.
Thank you. I found it.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work
DDR handicraft E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the Lok was used in Schlesien and Middle Germany, the very rare Lok is probably from the model rail conversion proposal ME Heft 11/1968, used with track and missing parts see photos, function well, The E 95 series is a heavy electric locomotive of the German Reichsbahn-Sellschaft (DRG) designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Schleschen network, possibly also from the construction company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Hall (Saale) and we are working operationally
In 1924, the German Reichsbahn Company had commissioned the AEG to submit proposals for an electric motor, which should be able to carry 2,200 tonnes of carbon trains and 530 tonnes of passenger trains at 45 km/h.
At maximum speed, 65 km/h were required.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined the delivery as 1Co+Co1' locomotive with a tatz storage drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens sugar plants with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered which received the operating numbers E 95 01–06.
They all survived the Second World War and were then found again in the territory of the later DDR.
In 1946 the locomotives arrived as repair goods in the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In Dessau’s Reichsbahnau improvement work, the processing value of all six locomotives was established.
[4] When the need for heavy-duty locomotives for heavy duty vehicles increased with the further re-electing of the medium German network, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were processed in 1959, with the other machinery as a spare parts donor.
The E 04, E 44 and E 94 were first built up in larger numbers.
Only when E 94 was to be seen that the number of processing could not be further increased did E 95 turn into the point of view of processing.
[4]At first the locomotives were stationed in the Leipzig-Wahren railway station.
They arrived at Halle P in 1960.
They were mainly used in a walking plan before coal trains from the Geijseltal in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complexity of the control of the locomotives has proved problematic with increasing age.
As a result, it has often been found that shields remain attached to switch operations.
Then the Beimann with Hammer and Woodskeil on this locomotive had to solve the gunfire again during the journey.
Damage to the motors often occurred and resulted in months of accidents at the locomotive.
[5] Since sufficient new locomotives were available at the end of the 1960s and there was no clear extension of the power plant at the time, the Reichsbahn was able to abandon old locomotives and most of the splits, so that the E 95 was out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electric locomotives only once more, which would have caused a problem in the train operation due to the difficulties mentioned with the machines and the conditions of view of the driver.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were dropped in mid-1969, they were followed by the E 95 01, which left the service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new name 255 001 has therefore never been used.
Up to the E 95 02 all locomotives were destroyed.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a soft heating plant at Halle main station.
It took some time before those responsible at the Reichsbahn were convinced that the E 95 was a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the first external processing of the locomotives started with the aim of presenting them to a vehicle show in the RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operable museum locomotive.
1986 was the internal completion of the locomotives.
In the DB Museum Hall (Saale) the locomotive museum is maintained.
Since 1995, employees of the Bw Halle P traditional community have been working on the operational processing of locomotives.
In April 2015, the locomotive could be presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with new interior and exterior painting, with the transformers being checked and five engines capable of operating.
-By 1945, the locomotives were in use on the Schlesi mountain railway and the drifting sideways, where they proved themselves on the basis of their reliable drive and the low maintenance effort.
In February 1945, the machines to Leipzig were converted into the medium German network.
Main application area was first Schlesien
Handicraft model H0 in OVP, function well, there are optical rework at the Lok in self-work necessary, stowed, with play trails, boiler smell !!!, very rare handicraft model, very small edition- possible also comes from the small-scale company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may contain labels and stock marks.
Yes, the F-parts are it
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The middle bar is held by two feet. Unfortunately these are too narrow and the bar cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle bar is held by two feet, these are unfortunately produced incorrectly.
The centre bar does not fit into the required hold.
So I'll be sent back.
When will they be released?
No, no, no, no, no.
That is, according to the assembly instructions the right of the form, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
Mainly they fulfill their purpose
They're not flat with me.
Could I get this?
Hello #NAME#, shall I explain the problem to you again?
Dwelling fire with two minor and high damage
Two people were easily injured in a fire in a residential house in Oberbayern.
In addition, an estimated damage occurred in the six-point euro area, as the police reported on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the nearby dwelling house in Kinshasa (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were brought to the hospital on Sunday with light smoke poisonings.
The exact issue of fire was not known at first, but the police did not come out of a deliberate fire.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over further investigations.
But it will come much later.
And I have to pay again shipping costs
To unlock fake news - Biontech-CEO publishes immp photo
Uğur Şahin published on the social network "LinkedIn" a photo of his first vaccination in 2021
Biontech-Chief Uğur Şahin had not so far publicly expressed his immunization status.
Now the entrepreneur released a photo showing his corona immunization.
A friend’s illness moved him to do so, Shahin told him.
The CEO and co-founder of the company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, published a photo showing how he receives an vaccine against the Corona virus.
In the social media there was false information that I was allegedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biotech Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote on Friday in a post in the network "LinkedIn".
"For a few months, friends have been forcing me to post a photo of me that I'm being vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far, he has rejected this because communication should not revolve around him.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply distressed when I learned that an old school friend was fighting for his life.
He has been fighting a severe covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a blower for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Shahin continued.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, which is often overcome by misinformation and suspicion."
Fear can only be difficult to deal with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet an interview with the German Welle, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was produced in December 2020, as did the Deutsche Welle itself.
"I am not legally allowed to receive the vaccine myself at the moment," Shahin said at the time.
There is a priority in Germany for the vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime, priority has been lifted for a long time - and the Biontech Chief has been improvised three times according to appropriate information.
Fire in power plant: tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the light went out on Friday evening: no electricity left and in many cases no heating either.
A fire had lit up a voltage station.
After a fire with severe damage in a voltage station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Westphalia area have had to leave for about 24 hours without electricity.
On the Friday evening, 41,000 affected residents and residents in several municipalities left the lights.
The provider Westnetz reported that on Saturday many emergency power units had been in operation until the large-scale disturbance could finally be completely repaired in the late evening.
Firemen and helpers and helpers of THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered support places in schools and called for neighbourhood assistance.
The care provider thanked the victims for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have led to significant restrictions.
We also thank ourselves for the affected municipalities, the circle, the firearms and the THW for their tireless use," said the head of the area of primary technology, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday night.
The repair of the damage will take place for a few more days, as the Westnetz monteurs were only able to reinitiate some of the lines at first, he said.
A technical defect led to the fire according to company information.
Power flows again
The fire that broke out on Friday at 7.15 p.m. has, according to Westnetz, seriously damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switch station in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid.
There are heavy cleaning and repair work required.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000 volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply continues.
Since Saturday at 6:00 p.m., more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichterroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually activated from 21.30 a.m.
Since 23.15 a.m., the last electricity has been affected by the failure.
Over 80 units of Westnetz and partner companies have been in use.
Following the construction of an emergency supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for neighbourhood aid.
"It is now important that citizens in their neighborhood take care of older or lonely people and communicate with local firearms houses when help is needed," said Landrait Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
The focus was mainly on the production and operation of emergency units.
According to the authorities, temporary care facilities have also been established in schools for people who have not been able to provide themselves or who need the power-dependent medical devices or who are referred to medical care.
Good morning!
Unfortunately, the deck is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy those with you and pay in euro?
It's the day cover #PRS_ORG# in blue.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy
But I can't mount that under the table.
It's a custom #NAME#.
Of these, there are 3 statements.
We wanted those with table plates diameter of #NUMBER#
we got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# came in, but I can't move it in and thus shorten it.
Can you help me further?
Otherwise, I had to send her back, because otherwise she was not suitable for the purpose.
I'd be glad to hear from you.
Yeah, that's really easier!
Then let's do it!
You're sending me the return card by mail?
the repair is now completed.
I've already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I had not re-started the e-#PRS_ORG#.
Shall I do it now?
I find such a low credit almost harmless.
That is why we do not agree.

When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both redesigned and use version 4.5...
Maybe they've heard more often of problems.
Having bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG#, it also seems to be on it.
As soon as I want to open it, the message will come, ups!
This document could not be opened.

I have to work in the meantime!
In order to keep the color order even and clean, you should clean the components with some soap water of dust, fat and fingerprints, wash and dry with clear water.
Before putting the brush on the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to exercise 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later visible inside of the components or on a yoghurt cup.
The first string on the component
Draw the brush evenly next to the stroke.
A slight overlap of the colour layers later ensures an even surface.
Avoid brush wipes quickly.
This creates unrealisticly effective areas.
A model is not a garden son.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could come out later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come to a complete conclusion with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can come to unbeautiful metal veils when mixed with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you stop them.
Originally reliable look achieves the models by the Decals or subtracting images.
From height signs on aircraft, including names of ships to lanes and markings for car models: The Decals give the model the last slot.
Bring the Decals in the right order as long as the components are still good.
An aircraft cockpit can be worn or worn more easily before it is installed in the rump.
Even more important than the right tool, such as scissors, brushes and toothbrush, are in the sticky time, patience and a calm hand.
Cut out each needed Decal individually and put it right.
Decals are also called water slides because you just moisten their back with water until the wearer's paper is dark through the nose.
Then you scroll the image just a small piece of paper and put the piece on the appropriate place on the model (which you also moisturized previously).
While holding the Decal on the model with a tool, you remove the carrier paper side by side.
Attention: Always check if the image is sitting properly before you slide it completely from the paper, so that it does not stick, clip or even shave on the finger.
Swallow excess water with a budget.
Not suitable for children under 3 years of age
I can only open a book briefly as soon as I look for something else, then I don't have to read the book anymore and I have to log out and log in and reload the book and search for the place where I have read.
I've already communicated with you on Saturday.
Do I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came to me in 3 individual packages
Thank you very much anyway!
Then I'll buy somewhere as soon as the money's back.
But do I get this back without any problem?
Child wish treatment in a car / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello together,
We have been in child-response treatment for some time now that it's about accounting with the car, it's suddenly going over.
Order by:
We had applied for the children's request in advance with the car and we got the commitment over 3 attempts.
The tests were limited in no way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt directly led to successful pregnancy and birth and was calculated with the car.
Some time later, we tried to get a second child, and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but they still did not calculate with the car.
We applied again for the purchase of the car and received 3 further attempts.
After some further tests (we have performed more tests than promised, logically counting the most expensive with the car) we settled the calculations at the car and got the evil surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the car wants to replace only 3 attempts.
Reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the other 2 attempts of the first commitment will fail.
The second wish for children is a new case of insurance.
However, according to the Terms of Reference, "the insurance case begins with the treatment, it ends when treatment needs no longer exist."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who here has the right to replace the PCV (only 3 attempts) or we (there are 5 attempts to replace)?
* Should the PCV have told us in the commitments that a birth will fail the further attempts?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (conditionally by closed conductors) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give your opinion.
Thank you so much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can get them back to the best
All right.
We're not going to order any more of them.
If they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost a good customer.
They're welcome to forward this to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, the colleague told me that the refund was due and now tell me that I have to send the matter back.
Well, I guess I can't do anything to ruin the comodity completely.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote.
It is clear and clear that the refund has been made and I have still not received a refund for #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that they have now lost two family clients.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We're not gonna do that anymore.
No, the defect occurred only after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they may not sell him as an office chair.
No matter what, the guarantee is valid for 24 months.
No, it's not possible for me to get another type of packaging.
I'm going to take down the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products will be purchased with additional hackers, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the week: The Best Low Budget Films
What a low-budget film is exactly, for this there is no general definition with precise budget limits.
Wikipedia has to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major movie studio or private investor.
In the network you can find abundant lists of low-budget films, such as Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What's the matter with you?
And maybe you don't like it at all?
I am a very good customer of you, have already set up 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
I wanted to ask the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it also reliable?
Thank you very much.
With friendly greetings
If there's no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes, it's not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes at the waiting position...I'll give it up again soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hello.
"Half victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU
In conflict with the Belarusian regime, the EU can announce a "half victory" according to political expert Raphael Bossong.
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
Sustainablely, the EU has not solved the confrontation, the researchers of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP) explained.
This state of affairs - Belarus does not contribute very little, but the EU feels like a winner - will probably continue for a while.
The treatment of people at the border was not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, Mr Bossong said.
Apparently, there is an "on-going normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole has not turned its back on this, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development also weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It obviously cannot be implemented if a Member State is in a position to do its job", as Poland is currently, which does not even allow Frontex to access the border.
In addition, the EU will pay another price for its policies at the border with Belarus, says Bossong: A principle agreement on asylum policy will be made more difficult as the line "Border protection, Border protection, Border protection" has been strengthened.
Retrieval of cross-border attempts
According to Poland's border protection, migrants have again tried to reach Belarus in Polish territory.
55 Migrants were arrested on Sunday night and brought back to the border, a spokesman for the Authority said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were thrown by the migrants with stones in the incident near the town of Czeremsza.
According to the data, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be provided medically by a military doctor.
In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months or tried.
The EU proposes that Alexander Lukaschenko, as a powerkeeper in Minsk, have angeled them with the prospect of entering the EU.
Poland and Lithuania have reportedly reportedly broken down according to border sections.
The EU punished Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners travel in the countries of origin of people to ban their departures.
The most effective element of the EU's response was the pressure on the airlines, Bossong said.
"There the EU has thrown its market power into the scale of the scale and has shown its determination to operate with hard tapes and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account domestic costs.
The Belarusian society has probably not been caught up in the fact that the security system has shut down thousands of people throughout the country regularly.
Mercedes protests after controversial formula 1 finale
Max Vertappen is supposed to have run two rules breaks during the race, according to Mercedes.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial formula 1 finale of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes filed an objection.
The silver arrows are supposed to have two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a alleged violation of Max Vertappen in the Red Bull in the last Safety Car phase, when he is supposed to have been over-reached.
A second objection was filed against the evaluation at the end of the race.
In Mercedes' view, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
On the last round Lewis Hamilton was still out of date in Mercedes and was attached to his first Formula 1 title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Netherlands had overloaded the car before it.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and report back to you.
Thank you for the support
Free entry for members: Europe Park event SC-Freiburg-Fantaag
The European Park, the nominee for the European Park Stadiums of the Freiburg Sports Club, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fantag.
As the park announces, members and permanent card owners of the sports club from Breisgau and members of the fan community were allowed to visit the Europe Park free of charge on this day.
In addition, there were still vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The rear trains lit on that day by the red and white T-shirts.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red and white balloons provided the perfect cupboard," said the park.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, there has been cooperation between the federal listist and the 40 km north of Freiburg, a leisure park located in Rust.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europe Park, it showed how well the partnership fits.
Seeing radiant fans who have shared fun in the back alley confirms this," says Europe-Park Owner Jürgen Mack.
why is the €#NUMBER# and not as originally €1699?

In order to get an optimal visual field, the lupe should be brought as close to the eye as possible.
The specially aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass to the edge.
Loops are often marked with magnification data.
However, these data only apply to exact conditions that rarely meet the conditions of use.
In order to make the best use of your magnifying glass, please note the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see package leaflet).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices – therefore also in the case of strokes – there are light flexes.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflective coating.
In compliance with the optimal conditions of use - lupe close to the eye - mirrors on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.

Danes sale in Schönwolde: In the Krembz municipality women pick out the Christmas trees
Agricultural Frank Diers has already experienced some of these situations when selling teeth.
Once, even a man should be driving home without his partner because they couldn't agree.
Every year he plants a good 2000 pieces for it.
The 56-year-old has already experienced some situations.
That makes Christmas time always something fun, he says.
What about the voucher?
Or am I gone as a customer?!
However, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I'll evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to discuss the better court here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spear.
And they both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which doesn't sound so good at all.
Problems with glass fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new fiber connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building up a stable Wi-Fi network.
Previously I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent up up to a few occasions without any use 50 Mbit.
The new fiberglass connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox.
However, the other DLan module, which sends the Wifi, does not add up to the full 500, but I continue to remove myself in the house with the module, the less comes (so use a boot box that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the internet with the new fibre connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which seems to be using a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similar losses here.
Could someone explain to me why with glass fiber so much internet speed is going to be "lost"?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely important to put cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, why I've created an extra account here.
That is why I would be much more pleased with an answer.
When it's time to change the giro account
Whoever would have thought now would have been at rest for the first time with the giroconts, he'd be fooled.
While many banks have taken advantage of the fall to have their customers confirm their past tax increases with all kinds of tricks, the free amounts for negative interest continue to decrease.
For example, the Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous with a limit of EUR 100,000.
Now she's just half the amount and even quartered for the day's money.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only to customers of the Group’s Postbank - to 50,000 euros in Giro and Investment Accounts and to 25,000 euros in daily accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower amounts are applicable to the whole Deutsche Bank, as one speaker confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
The commercial bank had already fallen to a limit of 50,000 euros, which is still applicable, as was the case with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which was just popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the amount of free money to two levels, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
In the meantime, more than 100 banks now have EUR 25,000 or less of the Verivox Internet Portal.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: however, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres that have been given the first instance before the Berlin Land Court against this regime.
Now, the banks are already discussing whether the institutions should be able to make return payments - in the event that the top bodies also have to explain the negative increases in principle for illegal and have to be repaid to millions of banks.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She's officially at the top of Hollywood.
But her life is like a mountain and valley ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected the most influential woman of the year by the U.S. magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For those who made 2021 with the "Friends" Association and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show" Furore, this success is primarily the result of much discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers takes care of their appearance.
However, according to Aniston, she liked a chip on the day (yes, read correctly: a single chip from the bite).
It's a miracle that you're still flying the hearts of the female and male fans anyway.
Maybe because she just has Pech with happiness - and still is looking for the great love.
And the baby wish has been removed from the list.
Before, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt.
The people who asked for it don't know what's going on with me personally, medically why I can't.
It was really hurting.
It remains to be hoped that success and glory will also be happy.
Invalid end of a career: he must give up
Kimi's separation from Formula 1 was even more silent than thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and removed the sweat from the forehead.
That's it.
After a driver’s fault and a light band touch, Rīikkonen had to stop his Alfa Romeo at the great price of Abu Dhabi after not even half of the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ending his career in the Motorsport royal class.
His wife Minttu and the two children were also traveling to the United Arab Emirates.
The greatest success of the empire was the victory of the 2007 World Cup in Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix wins, started 18 times from the pole and came to the podium 103 times.
Friedrich takes 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in the twins - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian Biathlet Ole Einar Björdalen with 94 successes is the goal of the Bobpilot.
"I've calculated this once, I had to enter nine-and-a-half victory per season, then I could make it up to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic winner of the BSC Oberbärenburg, who booked two successes in two days during the Winterberg race.
Only on Saturday did he stop the attack by Johannes Lochner by five hundred yards, in which he drove from rank three to one.
Then he changed something at the material setting and went out on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Hall), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Hall), he passed through the British Brad Hall.
The third became the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We have gone to greater risk today and have been rewarded," said Friedrich, who also won his 22nd victory in the series.
The Berchtesgaden Johannes Lochner, who runs for Stuttgart, came to the square two times before this time to rank five.
Christoph Hafer from the BC Bad Filnbach landed in place after Rank four in the first race.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, then I would do the same," said Lochner.
Nolte with home win - podium for Jamanka
Among the women, Laura Nolte won the third season in the two-bowl.
After it was only for the fourth place on the front day of the monobob, she met on Sunday at the German triple success with the plaintiff Deborah Levi to the World Cup.
Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thuringen came with Germany's fastest Sprinterin, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen, on rank two.
In addition to her Olympia qualification, she booked the first post office in this winter.
Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki landed in place three with Leonie Feebig.
For me it was supercool, first post office in the World Cup, I'm superhappy that Mariama is taking me.
I'm super happy with the development.
There's still a lot of potential at the start, but the starting times today were okay," Burghardt said and stressed: "It's not just a little bit of adhesion, but there's also a lot to do about it."
Jamanka got a little upset about the not quite error-free rides, but he said, "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the lid in my basket and could buy it now!!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I have not just received it, and therefore I cannot redeem it.
Through Corona last year, I had quite different problems and never time for it.
And now it was said he ran away which made me very angry.
Look at the chat it was about the Asare seat bank.
I want to return it and then order again as it is just reduced :)
Why is the shipment only started on 16.3.?
There was nothing of such long delivery time on your website
Not until I tip it up comes an extra field with the message
Yesterday was taken away from your colleague.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the wrong being.
But we want the regal module anyway, just a new undamaged
And don't cancel the whole order.
Just this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello love great girls and girls and women,
I've got something I just want to write, and maybe it's one thing or another.
I am 24, I have kPTBS, full-time student and dogema - apart from the fact that my dog does not cry or goes to the kindergarten, he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is sick, a second-degree burn has been on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see him and feel him, we cooked a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with the shower (because hand is in association with wg combustion).
It is cooled up and we see ourselves now less (1-2x week) which makes me very much interested in affection and love with my needs.
My dog child just had a stomachache, I cooked for him, and now he's in his cupboard, and he relaxes a bit after I've been there with the heat lamp and ironing for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and that's just gone for a month.
Now there is still household work on us, which we naturally divide.
But cooking yourself is just a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is just well-adjusted, I'm half-treated and I'm coming right.
Not good, but I'm coming right and I'm almost symptom-free.
My uni just requires a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3 p.m., I have done a written test for which I haven't done anything yet and over an hour of anatomy for which I should at least prepare something.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no room.
So my week goes like this: just until tomorrow, then it's weekend.
But then everything goes on?
Just until birthday.
Just until the start of the holiday.
Just until the end of the week.
Just until...
And that's how it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these spiritual points because otherwise I'll pack it down.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but otherwise I don't...
Is that how you feel?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I can't even put that in words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs.
I think this has something to do with mental loading of women, and that's why I thought I'd find safe relatives here...
I wish you at least another relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
I have received my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table bone has print.
At the first delivery, the color was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, will I get another color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
The rest of the time, twice.
But she wasn't confirmed.
I found at that time in school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and that it is only another matter for them, like math or geography.
It was always something strange to me, perhaps because I was brought up as a Christian and I always believed something like that.
How do you feel about that?
Perhaps you can also tell about work and study colleagues with different attitudes.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is useful to separate.
Is there a teaching plan, etc.
But it was also strange to have a physical teacher who did not believe in the theory of relativity.
What, then, does one want to learn about religion if one does not believe it?
Is culture true or what?
Hope your question isn't too private.
Can't change it or not?Write in English I also understand well
That's a long time ago, then I'd look away from it.
That's good, thank you.
I expect a return in time until the very beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Please wait while the movie is being played.
Hello, dear people,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (up to 24).
I think it's been a movie for young people.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
For one thing, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the kingdom of the dead) (not quite certain).
Since I can't describe it any more in the real world, there's a young woman.
And in the kingdom of the dead a young soldier (a uniform similar to those of the soldiers of the curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason the paths cross and there is an action.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the kingdom of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this kingdom to live myself, I mean.
The transition is I think the soldier's graveyard too.
In the end, I think both soldiers are fighting each other.
If that's what I'm saying to you, I'm grateful for every answer.
Our little one has only slept on the belly since week 1.
Fixed forward: still alive :D
Relax.
That's how a child hangs out a lot more than you think.
Make sure everything's right around, no turtles, often go in and look, but no minute surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Nice mattress.
No kisses.
Axo and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but they always had a blanket.
Watch your child when he sleeps.
Does it turn your head around?
Can it get out of the belly?
Or is it facing directly in the mattress?
You can decide if everything's okay.
We all grew up, and when my husband came to the world, it was like walking and giving up the baby to sleep.
Besides, we're already "Staff" with you and we've already bought a lot of articles
But why do you offer me only 20EUR?
Hello, I already wrote yesterday with a colleague of yours and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The box is not to be used at the moment.
To make it quite clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just that the policy of this transmitter is currently under all the heat.
Almost every format is sponsored ( ok), but then go on a big bed tour at the same time.
It was said that you are an "independent" Internet transmitter.
Quote Arno: You want "not to be a running lipid column".
What is it now?
A 0815 aggravator trying to bring his BilloMerch to the Elitefan.
And then we still have Marahs Do's & Don'ts.
Those of course apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they must continue to be political.
A krogman who lacks empathy and at the cost of the action with the exploded rented rooms tries to make ash.
How are you supposed to find this?
Great if you like it, I think it's scary.
I'm asking for a Rueckruf, since my delivered wooden table was defective.
Corporal fracture by damaged delivery of #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter in stomach pain or simply for coughing – My little warm friend can be used in a variety of ways.
Kirschkern rings are a traditional homeware for beneficial heat applications, as Kirschkerne heats can be very well absorbed and re-dosed.
The removable inner cushion can be warmed in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft relationship makes the application particularly pleasant so that the little ones feel protected, even if it is not so good for them.
The cirrhosis ring with reference is suitable exclusively for the following applications as heat storage:
Before heating the kiss, check on unusual smell, floor or fire spots and immediately dispose of it in the presence.
Please remove the inner cushion to heat out of the connection first!
In the microwave at max 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (Please note the manufacturer's details!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat through shakes evenly in the pillow!
Then put the inner cushion back in reference.
In the first warm-up, a slight moisture formation may occur on the surface, but disappears in repeated applications.
Do not hesitate to comply with the specified heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy performance may cause damage (inflammation and combustion risk!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that a heating of cereal products is allowed in the manufacturer’s instructions for use.
After the heated inner cushions have been brought back into contact, check the temperature of the pillow to fit the baby (max. 43 °C) on your wrist!
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or flammable conditions, circular complaints, fresh haematomas, bleeding drops and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain.
If you have any existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumor, or if you are pregnant, please contact your doctor before taking this medicine.
If nuts have opened and loose cores are removed, dispose of the product and loose core immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child should be checked regularly during application to exclude overheating!
All serious incidents involving the product are to be reported to the manufacturer and to the competent authority of the country in which the user is placed.
The connection is removable and washable at 30 °C in the machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!

Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (thinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded by my network share.
I bought this again about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the grid part alone was enough for the operation.
The battery is empty and the laptop does not start any more despite the network part.
After that, I've expanded the battery, but there's nothing going on here either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in the network operation?
Is there anything else that breaks?
Thank you so much for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But don't know how high the seat is....
Often on a tour and still a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack of Peak Design no problem!
20 litres of power also swallow larger photo equipment without problems that can be safely sold using the flexfold parts.
And what else you need in everyday life remains well organized and separate from the photo equipment thanks to practical access in the individual configurable interior.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series is still presented in a new look.
The smart, minimalist design has it literally in it - with the Everyday Backpack series Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack and yet provide quick access to the photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two options: Once conventionally via the lid, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, an excellent solution for effective protection that has already proved itself with the Messenger Bags.
There is a metal lock hook with suitable anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has thought of various "fills": there are 4 anchor bars, which are permanently destroyed, where the lock hooks can be hooked.
If the backpack is full, you just take the top bar, it's rather empty, a deeper one.
Pendants and hooks are also magnetic.
In this way the backpack can be safely closed without scratching the hooks.
The second option also distinguishes the Everyday Backpack fundamentally from other pockets: In addition to the lid, there is still a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to wander through the content anymore!
At the same time, this smarter detail increases the daily accessibility of the backpack: If you take not only your photo equipment but also everyday items or travel bags.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior space (more below) and then untangle the two without problems - and access it independently through the two side openings.
In addition, you can pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body to access, for example, the camera equipment in the right-hand side, while the daily things remain safe in the left half of the backpack and do not come between them.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable wear belts help.
And since the outer cover of the backpack is also made entirely of 100 % recycled, weather-resistant nylon, the content will remain dry even if it is to go to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am mistakenly waiting for the email from their support.
#NAME# gave me an e-mail yesterday confirming the mandate of
Contact details have been announced since the shipment to collect the wrong table supplied.
So far, I haven't received a message.
I'm asking for an immediate settlement.
I am already writing with the third support employee, with no one else I went beyond the promise that I would receive an e-mail as confirmation.
It's about sending back the wrong custom #NAME#
So it's time to look back at when the box could be delivered?
Keeping him like this is no option for me...
It's working.
Thank you so much for the help
Wish you another nice evening
Hello, my order is #NUMBER#. when is the item delivered?
Ordering and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp when I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher to me, then I will give up a larger order, but at any time I have kept the damaged furniture and not returned.
And that last year was different than thought, I couldn't believe it, and I just couldn't redeem it and clarify it.
But I have the damage as a customer and I don't accept it like that.
Rotating brake discs are designed to estimate the dynamic driver's claims, reliability and safety when braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotating brake discs are made from Guss and then mechanically processed (dried and cut).
All generated discs are manufactured in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific to certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program will be established, which will be guided by the balancing of the disc according to the characteristics of the original assembly.
The discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and brake efficiency.
Additional openings created increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, while the accessories improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake linings.
The aesthetic properties of our acquired discs highlight the character of each car by attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event marked the history of the west coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered light bursts in the water at the southern slope of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49 was released.
Thousands came from close and far and made Coloma one of the fast growing and flourishing cities of the country.
Areas have been hidden, tents have been laid down, and saloons and hotels have been created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many it was called "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankrott)!
In this game you are a pioneer who is looking for wealth in the West and wants to make a name.
You will look for gold, recruit workers, ride horses together and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to overcome your pioneer colleagues so you don't have to deal with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many ways to win.
At the same time, you choose your actions, you have to keep up with your resources and create a table that "works more and more for you" (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your table allow you to become more efficient, receive additional actions or apply rules for your benefit.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge floor, you can develop your individual game style with fine adaptations.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year in which the California Gold Rush) until 1850 (the year in which California gained official status).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game plan on which they can perform actions.
After that, their selection will be discovered and they will place their pioneers in the right places.
If a location has most pioneers, it gets a barrier!
This disables half the location - reducing possible actions there.
Then the players carry out different actions, such as the acquisition of resources, the movement of cars, the formation of tents, the search of rivers, the construction of bridges, the opening of shops and the positioning of revolvers.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the beginning of each round, the speaker turns to a new location and changes the available actions.
This goes on for as long as the attacker moves five times, so every location has been covered once and the year ends.
There is a shooting in which the Coloma players must defend themselves against an attack of angry bandits.
If the players have controlled enough gun heroes and the bandits are numerous, they receive rewards.
If they fail, however, they receive less rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final evaluation takes place.
The player wins with most points!

"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediaathek
CW mental violence, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentation has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
>Children's psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a pleasant guest in Talkshows and holds lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become tyrants" (2008) he released a strong educational debate.
Former patient:interns and educators now raise serious objections against him.
Please be careful, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
We parents and other responsible people can never, never, never! go to power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for his development and make the framework for the child as large as possible and meaningful in the situation.
Brr, I'm still being shot.
Holetschek: Countries advise on the withdrawal of the test obligation for three-fold vaccines
At its next meeting, the Ministers of Health of the Countries would like to decide on a national ban on the obligation to test three times a vaccine.
"We countries quickly need clarity, whether and from when the test obligation for three vaccinated people can fail," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), president of the Health Minister's conference, "Picture on Sunday".
The departure of 2G plus for three times vaccinated is "not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional implant," said Holettschek.
Federal Minister for Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) said that "he will make a proposal to the Minister of Health Conference on Tuesday." - afp
So I want to send the lamp back.
How do I do that best?
Hi, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you continue to help me?
I can't do any shopping any more via my #PRS_ORG#.

I've updated account data.
Where can this be?
What you describe is called "awareness", meaning mental perceptions under full narcosis.
These occur at a frequency of approximately 1 to 1000.
The most common thing is to hear voices/voices, more rarely to see pictures and more rarely to see pain.
Relevant for this issue: Imperial cuts are operations that involve an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep narcosis is avoided in order to protect the child until it is depreciated.
Previously episodes of awareness should be mentioned in the Narcotic Discussion.
Certain anaesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear everyone, this comment from me describes sensitivity correctly, however had** u/Nitemarex **by definition none.
Have read her comment incorrectly.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help us.
These are legal guarantees.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the defective chair.
This is in addition to the legal obligation in the area of eCommerce.
Please check again to see if they can at least return the defective chair.
We'll sell the second chair in private.
We'll lose some money there too.
I've already sent you an e-mail that you haven't answered.
Again, the question.
In order and on account, the goods are delivered to a room of my choice.
The shipper is a company #NAME#.
I just called.
I was told that they only delivered to the door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that right?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don't know a person who can wear the heavy furniture on the first floor.
I'm not gonna be called, am I?
I had asked a question
Theatrical historian Günther Rühle 97-year-old
He's profiled himself as a theatre critic and as an intern.
Later he wrote a monumental theatre story.
On Friday Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, pressurised: "An old man gets older".
The shocking diary of a slow departure from the world, led by the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading the message comes that the author died.
The last sentence in the book is: "I have already witnessed my lifelong thanks."
There are different types of palettes.
One of the most common are European sheets, standard wooden pallets, which are mainly used in the European space as a loading carrier.
They are certified by the European Palettes Association EPAL
According to data from the statistics of Austria, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria.
The production value was well at EUR 79 million.
How many palettes are imported annually to Austria will not be collected
New York won the MLS Championship for the first time
New York City FC won the title for the first time in the Major League Soccer.
After 1:1 in the regular playing time against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided the final in the Elfmeter shooting with 4:2.
At the end of the Eastern Conference, New York had fought against the Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Ripping Tips & Tricks
I had received a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect gulag.
It was Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thank you again for this :)
Now I've come to the taste and I want to cook the first rolauden to Silvester.
Tomorrow, I'm going to set up a cattle fund for this.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, but just a big pot.
How's it going now?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not so good anymore, but I get it
This is about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by mail on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But to this day, the money hasn't gone into my house.
Please check there.
Where there are still Christmas breads in the room of Lübeck
For many people, Gans or Ente are among the Christmas days such as the dance tree and the gifts.
You haven't taken care of a bird yet?
Now time's getting tight.
We'll tell you where you get another Christmas meal in the room of Lübeck.
The "Drive" of a pipe end level contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor switch.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controller, you can adjust the desired level on the one hand and the level of the silence of your sounds on the other.
In addition, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller that allows you to reduce the noise level without changing anything on the "gain" and the distortion.
On top it already sounds like you can even make a performance reserve with the POWER LEVEL regulator when it comes to sound.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL regulator, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone can also be used as a line output.
The signal here is processed with a box simulation, so that you get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression when using a headphone or direct recording.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX box so that you can join your favorite songs.
A Tuner function is also on board - so you do not need a separate voice device.
In addition to spending a VFS5 foot key, you can also call the sounds comfortably by foot, turn on/off the effect blocks and "stop" the tempo of the corresponding effects.
For the live use this is actually inevitable.
With its new power packages, VOX will take another step towards the future!
But I'd seen it like that with others.
Then is it possible for you to send the lamp back?
Since it's too low for a table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you help me further?
And the Commodore?
Do we receive an update in the next few weeks for the exact delivery deadline?
Hello, they're already sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it didn't work out, I'd be happy with a legacy or a certificate.
Under the circumstances, I find a buyer for the furniture.
Just over 1,000 euros for goods that I don't need, then something much.
I had just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the expected hooks.
That is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been paid
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
In the negotiations on the resumption of the International Atomic Convention, progress has been made according to Iranian data.
"Both sides are just ahead of agreeing on the issues that should be on the agenda," said Iran's Chief Retailer Ali Bagheri on Sunday of the Irna News Agency.
This was a "positive and important development", because at first there was no agreement on the subject to be dealt with.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on the resumption of the agreement were continued after a few weeks' interruption.
Traders from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France and Russia participate in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also on the ground in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thüringen obsolete Saxony - Freistaat now Germany with the highest corona incidence
Thüringen has dissolved Saxony and is currently showing the highest incidence in the nation.
As the only federal country, the value is over the mark of 1000.
As the only federal country, Thuringia was located at the crown incident on Sunday over the 1000 brand.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value of 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which was the last ever to show the highest incidence in the nation, this value was 990.5.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia fell slightly, but it was also above the value of 1000.
Within one day, 2242 new burns were reported with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths related to an infection in Thuringia.
200 patients with Covid-19 were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends, there may be delays in reporting.
In addition, the health offices have been overloaded for weeks and are barely behind with the collection of new cases.
I understand.
As delivery takes place in early March, it may be possible to do so.
I have to print it and stick it to the package and hand it over to the post, was it?
I don't have to click/add/fill anything here?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take the return at my own expense.
8 EUR return fee is a frequency in my eyes.
It's time for changes
##MBundeday welcome me, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary room in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What's the post here?
Once you look at the activity in the last few months of the MBundaday, you can find one: it is not existential.
We came to a winter star and extended the summer hole for a few months.
#What's the problem?
Yeah, where did it lie?
For the most part, this should simply be linked to the dissatisfaction, how some things have happened here and how we are generally present.
In the last few days, the impression has increased that many people here are really still on the MBundesday.
#What we need to change
In this place the community is asked around the MBundesday which wants to keep them alive.
The attack came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days, and one has simply found sharpheads.
After a few correspondences, several people from the community have found themselves wishing to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to call on everyone specifically to participate, only so that this project can also exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server on which we can exchange each other, as well as develop concrete things.
You can access the server via this link.
Destination:
* How will the MBundesday work in the future?
* What existing arrangements must be modified/removed?
* How are we to act on the outside in the future?
* How are new members to be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten something, but it's not bad, so we have the disagreement at the end.
If you have a desire and time, come to the Discord, work with and let us democratically decide about the future.
I've ordered a lamp screen for you to be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big for it and not suitable for my taste.
I've already ordered another suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about that.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also rather sad because the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the day cover #PRS_ORG#, is it also in excess, i.e. in 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# needs to be able to guarantee that the faulty box is picked up in time.
And I'm asking you to start now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, but the cabinet will be unmounted as far as possible for the collection - they need to clear with #PRS_ORG# how it can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me on the phone at any time to agree to a pick-up time.
Is there a guide for the assembly?
How long would I have had time to take care of this or decide to return it?
How do you answer the question, why are you vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She has lived a while vegetarian herself, today she probably eats very rarely meat.
I was a vegetarian myself a few years ago.
The question is whether I want to be vegan, and vegetarianism has been a planned intermediate step, I have answered honestly without much thought.
And although I thought for a long time that I would support animal welfare as a vegetarian, I had at one time reflected and understood that I would eventually also support animal breeding.
That's why my decision to be vegan.
At the time I had the impression that it was on her side that mismut, she then defended vegetarianism and thought she knew where her meat was coming from and reduced as a vegetarian animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was "plump"?
How do you answer the question?
If you had the feeling that you would quickly be stuck in a corner as a Veganer, and there would be conflicts without which you would put it on.
It greets a harmonious vegetarian (;
This is clearly not an exception under § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# do not detach from the legal requirements to the remote set.
I am on the assigned date where #PRS_ORG# my return is not collected on site.
Because I can't be on site for a funeral, it's not possible to change that either.
May I have an alternative pick-up period?

Lahnsteiner Wehr equipped for water rescue: 45,000 Euro grant from the country
Recently, the Rhineland-Pfalz Interior Minister Roger Leventz in Lahnsteiner Rathaus issued an allocation note of EUR 45,000 for the new vehicle water rescue of the Voluntary Firearm Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle in use since November 2020 is EUR 135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am glad that the country of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in this,” says Lahnstein's Mayor Peter Labonte.
The vehicle is used by the Lahnstein dive bar, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water they perform tasks in water and ice rescue and technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, there is a constant rise in the number of jobs: the boom of hotel shipping on Rhein and Mosel, as well as the continued increase in the use of Lahn as a leisure flow, contribute to this.
I bought myself a book that I could only read at 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
However, following their recommendations, they have synchronized, removed and the newly loaded app NICHTS has worked.
I'm hungry because the whole operation has taken me a lot of time and I hope for help now.
Okay, then it's like that.
I would like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection to June.
Can I enter an appointment in the order process?

For the first time, thanks to your position here, I spent almost a decade in civil service in a similar activity, we were also armed in the Executive, and I don't want to go on with it!
The question of right and left is always very simple.
Basically, however, it should be said that, of course, the civil servants come from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, which should actually be clear to everyone.
That, of course, even in the particular uniform and armed people right from conservatively, should also be clear to anyone that these people can then naturally deal with the living reality is also clear, because of course you have besides the average white, now many Germans with migration backgrounds, women and also homosexuals (and so I don't mean the exaggerated female cliques, because they exist in the executive rather than garnish, but quite normal men and women whom you don't notice if they can't tell it) and also I have to rely on these people, because they are in doubt saving your life or putting it for you.
But these marginal groups also represent, even if for the first time it sounds comical to my experience in terms of conservative behaviour, are proud of Germany and feel less relieved by excessive left-wing policies, even if this policy is supposed to be used for them or if it is supposed to be right for them, they simply want to be treated quite normally.
Back to the rights, of course, since police and military forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme rights there, but they can openly say their opinion there or even openly throw any dangerous plans out of the way is mediated and I am also angry.
Of course, it appears that even policemen and soldiers who have often been in the foreign service have often started to pauscalise because of negative experiences, and sometimes things say that the controversy is wrong until politically.
It is also apparent that even right-wing fellows will meet those who do a real exchange of thoughts.
Nevertheless, what I think is well being combated and also countered by political education and education!
Germany is so much international and that is also so good in my opinion that we could not give it to us at all to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yeah, what I don't understand, I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I already ordered in November.
But I was so confirmed in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I used to chat with #NAME#.
Alternatively, you could deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black or this basket is available anywhere in Germany.
I always find you the only partner company.

Ordinarily by a child?
Hello, I (w32) have been busy for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (I am independent, very little leisure time), but for the rest of my life I get it worse than right to keep my house clean and proper.
There are always phases in which everything remains, and then and when it packs me and I clean up and wet.
But it's never really so "that sometimes someone could come to visit spontaneously".
My husband is not even better, but I am upset somewhere, but most people lose their household just against work and want.
The kitchen is still the most regularly cleaned since we like to cook.
Now, to my question, did you manage to get better with a child?
We still have nothing to do with it, and this question has been working on me for a long time.
Because for me I don't have any tension, it just doesn't bother me so much until a visit comes and for example, there's always fresh clothing and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a bigger pull with a child or do you keep sneaking?
I'm looking forward to your answers.

Career in social work - as someone with a self-insecurity personality disorder?
I have been training in the field of software development and have been trained for about a year.
Unfortunately, however, I find that this profession is not the right thing for me, because I have been thinking about starting again and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have a self-evident (or fearfully avoiding) personality disorder (AVPS).
This means that I don't have a sense of self-worth and I'm so shy.
I don't have a problem talking to people on a business level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and I've been told that I'm acting unacceptablely (which I think I've already become better).
Can I become such a social worker?
I do not want to work as a streetworker or in the open youth meeting, but rather to work on, for example, search advice or family assistance.
However, I do not know if the actual working day really is the way I imagine it, and it is difficult to find anything on the Internet.
The AVPS is already leading to problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because it pulls me down every time there's something to stand up to in my code ("the easiest thing to do again") and I find it difficult to ask for more experienced colleagues to help ("I should really know how to do this"/"I keep him with my stupid questions from working"/"who really needs to keep me for less time" etc.).
The problems I will probably have in every profession but I wanted to mention them instead.
But you've already recovered the sofa?
Because there was no confirmation for this.
I'm waiting for a pick-up date.
What do they mean, give it back?
If I have downloaded a book on the #PRS_ORG#, the message Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
Are there any problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I got a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The protein (protein) contained in the feed breaks the bird into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) in its stomach tract and builds from this its own body protein, which it also needs for feeding.
The breeding of poultry and the breeding of poultry in the rat are extremely complex procedures and are associated with a particularly high claim for the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NECTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as other disturbances may occur in the brutish course.
Following this curative administration of NECTON-Bio, the daily supply of vitamins with NECTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NECTON-MSA (mineral substance preparation) should be retransmitted.

It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/sweet food as the bird consumes daily and changes water/food daily.
A striped measuring spoon (injected) corresponds to 1 g of NECTON bio.
In the case of severe strain damage, the double or triple dose of NECTON bio may be given at first until the method of re-education of the strain is visible.
Thereafter, the normal dose will be reached until the retraining of the spring is complete.
Storage: NECTON bio should be stored without solar radiation between 15° and 25°C.

Statement by a Community employee in opposition to the Statute
Hallo r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
Our property is supposed to like a Walnuss tree.
Thus, a case application was sent to the community.
An employee writes to me that the case of fruit trees and thus the Walnuss is not part of the statute.
In the Statute, however, the Walnuss is explicitly referred to as a protective tree.
Can I now rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I have to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for them.
I didn't get a message.
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me a legacy or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yeah, I think that's just the question is, can I pay in euro and let me deliver the deck to Germany?
Can you check this out?
E-mail: Serious traffic accident in selfb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred at St. 2179 between the Self-Nord and Plößberg connection point.

There are injured.
Ah, okay, I get it.
Well, then thank you so much again that it was so easy!
Council and ideas for further professional life
Merry Christmas to you for the first time!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good, because my dear head just remembers everything you can think of.
Before I explain here.. in short: I need advice and the best of people who know my situation somehow - that is, of you.
I'm just making the ref as a curator.
Originally, I studied something else and also worked there in an area (to remain a little anonymous, I don't say anything more here).
But it was all too boring for me, and I've looked at alternatives that could make me more fun.
I once landed in the classroom and was sure that it was - even though the framework conditions were significantly more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care about that.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job offers".
And it's only half a year away.
In the times before, I have always decided to continue and at least end the ref, and after that I can still turn around.
But I'm absolutely done.
I've had so little time in the last month that I'm completely out.
Now there are vacations, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my celebration night.
There I was free.
And the stress at work was in the moments.
Now it's my own family party that's too much stress.
And then there are these rigid structures that make me nervous.
Basically it makes fun and looks from the outside the ref also runs well as regards the feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and I wonder how much stress my body can withstand before it completely shuts down - if he doesn't already do that.
I wonder if I would like to have the rest of my life - just when I read some contributions from you here - or if I shouldn't go back to the old area, where I was valued, I could take free time when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring, but was properly paid for it and worked together in a team, and not as a single fighter, as it is now, most of the time the case.
But then I wonder if in one year I have not returned to the same place as I am now and not satisfied.
You know, it's all kind of wrong, but maybe you have as an external council or ideas, like I'm out of this situation that I'm completely finished and start to cry about it almost at the slightest thought.
I will not make decisions so emotionally right now, which probably leads to nothing good.
But maybe your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or Christmas, which is enough for me for the first time.
Thank you for reading and apologizing to me for the winery tone.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of VOX has been constantly developing, which has led, among other things, to the combination of advanced modelling technology with the "Valve Reactor" switch, which perfectly simulates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely at the latest state of the art in matters of sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp switches, the VTX amplifiers await with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube amplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated switch, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonance just sprays.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the Amp and the effects sound as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound and modeling technology is mainly due to the VOX Valve reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 has again led to a performance push of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics as well as more and more decisively improved amplifier models.
From hand-held VT20+ to VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed to find all guitarists looking for a maximum variety of sound.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced play of game dynamics and string hits as well as a prompt appeal.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the end-stage determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor switch, with a 12AX7 tube, consists of each VT+ amplifier, represents the behavior, subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier perfectly.
NBA: Despite 20 points of carter: Magic lose at Clippers
The Orlando Magic series is held in the NBA.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but victory against the Los Angeles Clippers is not enough.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven counters of his older brother Moritz lost the Magic on Saturday 104:106 at Los Angeles Clippers.
The main case is also adaptable: with three individual plazier and foldable shutters, it is fully suited to the needs of your photo equipment and is thus suitable for any type of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes up to full-format mirror reflex cameras.
What finally fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible fitting would be a DSLR camera with a set lens, two to three swap targets and a flashlight.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for further lenses.
In addition, you can steal any amount of accessories.
And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for his equipment and for photo-stranged things.
Even drone pilots meet with the Everyday Backpack 20L an optimal choice because the backpack offers sufficient space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano Exploitation on La Palma: probably longest in history
In the almost three months since the outbreak, the lava currents on the Canary Islands have caused great damage.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 was 84 days long as the longest on the Atlantic Peninsula before the West Coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on earlier outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has taken off somewhat in the past few days, but volcanoesologists have no longer been waiting for a forecast when it could end.
The indicators refer to a delay.
The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the state TV broadcaster RTVE.
Damages in millions of heights
In the almost three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1000 degrees of lava has destroyed nearly 2900 homes and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
Nearly 1200 hectares were covered by a metridic lava layer.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damage being estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new landscapes with a total size of about 50 hectares were created in front of the coast by cold lava.
In particular, the very important banana cultivation for the island was seriously affected, about half of which live directly or indirectly for some 85,000 people and which was already in the crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plants were destroyed, other areas were severely affected, the newspaper El País wrote.
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas stands in front of the door and especially the children will hardly be able to expect the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have been associated with the spiritual atmosphere and the nimble tension somewhat seductive to themselves.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that keep our increasingly divided society together.
The more important it is to be aware of the Christmas tradition of the gift, so that the gesture of the gift, which, according to French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, has been a peace-stimulating "social contract of natural peoples", can be avoided and refilled with life in the context of this tradition.
How the Christ became a child from Nicolaus
It was strictly the Protestants through whom the Christmas day was closely linked to the donation.
Previously, on the day of Nikolaus, gifts were handed over to some form.
The background of this still popular sitting is that the Holy Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, secretly threw three women into their windows in one night to save them another life in sin.
From this unconventional kind of gift, the popular custom in Germany was to fill the boots with gifts.
Protestants opposed this practice because they deny mediators between God and man as "holy worship".
For these reasons they defend themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christ Child out of Nikolaus and thus founded a new line of tradition.
The focus of the donation therefore shifted to the Holy Night.
Since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so closely, it only aggravates the least that the use of St. Nicholas is similar to the use of Martinsingen and Martinsumzug is still a fixed part of the Christmas season.
Today you will find in boots before the door and under the Christmas tree from Socks to desired luxury watches everything that the heart desires.
Variety of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources testify to a tradition of the gift since the 13th century on the day of St. Nicholas.
With the reform, the day of the donation moved to the weekend.
In all Christian lands, however, a joyful cupcake is ruling over the question of who gives the gifts to the children.
In Germany it depends on the respective region whether the Christmas child appears on the Holy Night or the Christmas man, who is in principle a species of Nikolaus, who has been assigned some types of property over time.
These include, for example, his white scaffolding, which has little to do with the rather strict assyrability of the historical figure, his skirt, which is drawn by renters and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, St. Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who should have guided them on the way to Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes fable beings bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought Father Frost to some glory.
Here there are not renters, but three horses who draw his skirts as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the mother country of the reform during the Husitian Wars, the Christ child is responsible for the transfer of gifts.

Police shoot alleged bank robbers near the royal palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police told us that callers had reported a man who was supposed to have gone to a bank with a gun and a bookkeeper's business.
The man fled according to the authorities in a vehicle that could be stopped a little later by officers.
Shoots fell and the man was hit.
He was still declared dead at the theater.
The police didn't come from a terrorist background.
In the area around the Kensington Palace there are several messages.
The palace is the official residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?
No matter where I click, I will be immediately forwarded to your site.
The decorative light is harmoniously incorporated into any beet, garden area or stone.
The light is simply set up and can be anchored with 2 earthly tips in the ground.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt Solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Luminance max. 10 hours.
- The robust plastic production is usable throughout the year in the outside.
In the Hollywood Spectacle there are usually dangerous objects from distant galaxies that glow in their inner colors.
On the other hand, quite harmless is “Smart Stone”: Only the sun ensures that this sunlight shines fascinatingly – either in white or colourful light (in six different colours at the same time).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a natural-shaped big bowl, this modern light object presents itself at day.
Its organic circles fit in every natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the grass or in the stone area.
He also makes himself known in the vicinity of larger boilers and finders, where he is known for his size.
You can save yourself big preparations: As a solar light, “Smart Stone” does not need any wiring or batteries.
Place the “lightstone” at any place that the sun shines for days.
Two co-supplied earthworms provide a solid hold if needed.
The matt white plastic envelope itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module hides “Smart Stone” discreetly inside it, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colourful light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
In the event of a breakup, “Smart Stone” starts to light itself; in what color do you determine yourself: equal to six attractive colors of light – in addition to daylight – you have to choose.
The switch is also automatically switched off as soon as the battery charge level has been reduced to a specified minimum or it will be lighted again.
As soon as the sun appears again, the charging cycle begins the next day.
I've done that many times.
Unfortunately, I would have liked to keep ordering you, but if I don't get the credit card, then I won't be ordering in principle.

Arrowhead Problem
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
I hope I'm doing everything right here, it's actually saved my first post after a year.
To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had so incredibly bad pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I would like to keep this up, because I have to take enough medication because of chronic diseases that I cannot choose.
My main problem, not the pain, but my skin.
At my last approximately two-year break from 0 to 100 explosive pixels and these everywhere.
That's so superficial, but it made me feel pretty and I didn't feel good.
In the two years of pause, the whole thing has never really normalized.
Maybe someone has any tips to avoid this time.
Perfumes-free and without touch is already my cosmetics, but maybe there's something someone can recommend.
Unfortunately, the woman doctor didn't take me so seriously, and the time is coming.
Many love thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Had a prebupert had bad neurodermitis, then a time of calm, then large-scale knee joints and the acne theme.
I have also tried everything possible in the course of Mr. Sickness and I have been hanging on my knees sugar, milk and lean meat mixture because otherwise nothing has worked so well.
It may also be good that hormone is simply the worm in it, but if you have a building like I have everywhere you want to keep looking no longer to go what else is going wrong.
I already had all of her colleagues' semina o. ä.
I wrote and now I've lost the conversation and I don't know what was answered to my questions.
I have to work all the time on the phone and suddenly everything was gone...
What's there to check if the money was there, I'd have seen it.
Please check my bank records, maybe there was something wrong.
But there's him in general.
Because it's in black.

110-kV ground cable will be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the release of the new high voltage cap at Tann is legally valid.
The plan-setting decision of the government of Niederbayern opens the way for the construction to begin in 2022.
This was now shared by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven kilometers long ground cable will connect the transponder Tann in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and parish churches.
The cable is connected to a mast of release near the town of Edermanning at Reut.
Good morning,
My order dated 03.01.21 with order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in parts with us.
The blue bet cell number:#PRS_ORG# with the #NUMBER# transmission number was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next procedure is?
A nice start in the week!
You can forget that, but I already explained it several times yesterday!
This is a glass chest and all the pages are set up, so the glass is everywhere and the carton is broken

but why only EUR 20?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER#EUR
No, it's in all the books, so it's the question at #PRS_ORG#, because it's probably a general problem.
Ref: Plan teaching (EC)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I've been in the ref since summer, teaching makes me fun, but I still have great problems planning my teaching in the field of earth science in a timely manner.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so in principle I can only use the table, school book and an OHP as a medium.
In addition, I can only copy s/w for free (what nerves for earth science).
I just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we're doing the geofactors right now, and with me it's actually every hour.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I do not want to spend too much time for simple hours of teaching (I also need them for UBs, etc.).
In planning, I always get out of the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather unhappy.
That's why the worksheets too.
Maybe I can get an Earthquake teacher how to work with the book in a time-efficient way.
I'd really be happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the #NUMBER# order.
However, I have actually decided to make a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to deal with the returns for the first time as soon as possible.
Trade is afraid of the 2G regulation on Christmas business.
In most businesses, only those who are vaccinated or healed may be allowed to do so.
Trade makes it unnecessary and dissuasive to trade.
He's got a possible solution, too.
In the view of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G rules undermine the important Christmas business.
In the case of transactions with items of non-day demand, sales disruptions were to be complained, criticised HDE chief businessman Stefan Genth.
According to a current survey of the HDE among 1,100 traders, more than 70 per cent of the companies looked negative on the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written down the Christmas business.
"What really should be the positive height of the year is now often a hole without soil," Genth said.
Therefore, traders with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis rates in the past week.
It runs well only in food retail as well as online.
The Association called for consequences from dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the chief businessman.
"2G does not bring us any further in the fight against pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations frightened customers and required high staffing.
The band regulation had to be allowed across the country, he demanded.
After that, each customer had to be checked for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) only once and would have access to all shops with the tapes received on that day.
In addition, sampling checks should be sufficient in retail trade - as already in public transport under the 3G rule (vaccinated, cured or tested).
Deutsche Euroshop also spoke about a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at well 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, the sales at approximately 90 percent.
These figures will now fall safely in the middle of such an important Christmas business," said Chief Executive Wilhelm Wellner of the "Economic Week".
Due to the high personal and administrative effort, the Centre will try to find and obtain solutions.
This includes the so-called band solution, where "visitors, for example, at a central location in the center once provide their 2G detection and then - equipped with an armband similar to in a club hotel - can enter all shops uninterruptedly".
I recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratcher and the frame is also an error that has been tried with a yellow filler to be cached.
That looks bad.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and attached it.
How do I have to proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high colour display.
For setting the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor provides exceptional possibilities.
In addition to the brightness adjustment, there are two standard colour temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually adjust and store the colour temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive to operate.
The light creates a very light stream with soft light of high quality, completely flimsy.
The 120-degree radiation angle, with which you can illuminate large areas at relatively small distances is excellent.
Also in reporting situations in small spaces or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work on both the film set and the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller enables remote control of the lights in television studios or when the light is installed in difficult places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel consisting of buttons and a illuminating display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current colour temperature in Kelvin.
There is also the slot for the NP-F battery (not included in delivery)
User Memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
In order to perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage space, it is easy to record and complete one of the storage keys by pressing longer.
The memory controller saves the current state of the lamp when switched off, so that when new activations, the familiar situation is restored - very practical in the studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the largest strengths of DL3120 functionality is due to the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F battery.
These are often already in possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can access existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the battery has sufficient power - it is a battery battery server installed at the same time - for each of the two battery modes a value in the two displays (the left battery top display, the right on the bottom display).
In addition, of course, it is possible to provide the transmitters with electricity over the supplied network.
The construction of the fireworks is very easy.
You have a 16mm hole as an accessory for fixing, so you can directly access your photo booth.
The inclination is to be reliably adjusted by determining on both sides.
It was taken into account that the mechanical components are also extremely high and are therefore also designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a slope is included in the range of delivery.
Great is this also contained in the delivery volume.
So you can buy the lights with all the accessories you may want to buy, safely transport or store without any problems.
The damage I have received and it is too small :(
"Party that we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after dry comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Entracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes the last two times in series were supposed to be on the way to the next Bundesliga plea.
But then the SGE turned up, within a good hour the frost bursted over a growing season start from the soul and beat Furios with 5:2. "It's crazy what the boys did today," cheered Coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and said a "pauschal-lob, to every individual who was with it."
At first it looked like a new damper for the Frankfurters now in rank nine still behind their expectations.
Patrick Schick had led the Leverkusner with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE coach.
"How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I'm crazy happy with the performance we've shown and of course also with the result.
Also, Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to be on the scene again for the first time since the fourth day and his injured muscle injury, stressed the morals of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly big," said the 27-year-old and looked forward to the result especially for the audience.
That was the party we were about to throw today.
However, for the coming tasks, Glasner now wants to keep the focus on himself, but it also looks well on the situation of staff.
It is exceptional that we all have fit players in December that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It is top work in our medical department, but players also live highly professionally.
Now you want to "go step by step and stay modest" and to "pass the tasks to this level" until the annual change.
As the next one is already on the program on Wednesday during the English week at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 p.m., Sky).
Grade I get the mail that my package comes back to you because of an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and let it redirect, no chance.
Can it be sent directly back to me, or do I have to wait until the money has been returned and the order has been returned?
Unfortunately, if I were to say so, I would not order again because it has been a long time.
Have they ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Damper for handball women before quarter-finals against Spain
Germany's handball women are just after the humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty views from the parquet.
At 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 viewers in Granollers, the DHB's selection was cancelled at the end of the World Cup and must now be against the host of Spain in the quarter final.
"We were too afraid and had too much respect for the opponent," Federal trainer Henk Groener said.
We must act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow.
That was a bad game we all had to delete," said Captain Emily Blok.
In the struggle to enter the semi-finals against the WM-second of 2019 on the coming Tuesday, there has to be a significant increase in order to keep the delicate dream from the first medal alive since 2007.
The best German painter in the duel with the three-time Olympic Denmark was the back room player Alina Grijseels with six doors.
"We just weren't there - neither in the attack nor in the defense," said Xenia Smits, and asked: "We need to look forward quickly now."
From front to back not at the height
Unlike in the previous five tournaments, the German team with the anpfiff was not at the height.
Missiles and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a fast 0:4-back stand after seven minutes.
Only Torfrou Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented with some parades worse.
The first gate reached the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counter-attack.
However, this was not the expected initial ignition.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danes, the German women could hardly sit in the scene - and however, they usually failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the door of the Scandinavians.
So the party ran early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially Mia Zocke's backroom player a little later because of a hard crowd at her opponent's still red.
But at the fourth final, she can be involved again.
Only in the final phase of the first half time did the DHB selection get a little better into the game and until the break to at least five towers.
However, the only hope for a recovery after the change was after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Greeners sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-established opponent, who is among the medalists at the end of the round.
As a result, the German team was no longer able to rise to an increase in performance and went as a clear loser from the park.
DACH-Advent Calendar Day 6: Family traditions in Christmas
As part of the Reddit Advent Calendar, we have celebrated the day of Nikolaus and take this occasion to dedicate family traditions to the Christmas season, the Advent, Nikolaus, Christmas Eve and the Christmas Day.
How was your home back then?
How about your partner?
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children too?
What is the most beautiful thing for children?
The boot pouch?
Plybacks?
Tree decorations?
Is it musiced?
Does the Christmas man, the Christ Child, or is it the gift of Grandma and Grandpa?
No matter how you do it, everyone goes on and around Christmas work, having it as beautiful as possible as family.
Whether these are solid traditions now, or even every year something else: tell us how it happened or happened in your family!
Please send me a transaction number... or something else that could help.
Transfer confirmation... etc.
I'd like to give you a good-looking code.
as in #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
Is that what they're doing?
The title presupposes that I work as an implant in mobile implants in which (until now only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated in nursing homes.
As soon as they are ready for a large part, it will go on partly in vaccination centres for me.
I would like to answer questions without a time limit on organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, unless they are related to a personal (e.g. "I take medicine X, this is with the vaccine.").
In my task area, the explanation for the vaccine, the presentation of the indication (person is entitled to an vaccine for coronation and no reasons to speak against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (I have never happened).
The vaccine itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical professionals.
However, in immphteams we often have no part of it, but "only" (for God's sake, we don't want no missing value!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of the vaccine, but can't carry out any vaccines (may I?), so that I can also carry out most of the vaccines myself.
Heavy "Huidler" question: Amberger knows the solution
What's a "huidler" please?
With this dialectic word, sent by an Amberger, the BR television broadcast "We in Bayern" has been provided for a lot of thought.
However, unlike many previous days, the term in the series "Host me?" remained unannounced by the callers this time.
No, it wasn't "a man who's nervous."
And no one who needs to go "everything fast".
That, the people heard from the TV moderator, was totally wrong.
The man from Amberg reported the solution and thus probably also provided surprises for many of the tophills.
"The skindresser," the viewer experienced, "is a laptop with which someone wipes the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed as an expert on Bavarian television for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical superficial term, it derives somehow from the rather well-known word "Houdern".
Why was an education gap closed - perhaps even for some who have been living in the Amberg room for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books in 2 weeks.
There is always the following error message after confirmation: opens - something is wrong - try again later.
I re-started the #PRS_ORG#gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected, synchronized and repaired with the PC.
Nothing has helped.
Do you really want to use the tire wheel to make sure that it's safe?
This morning, I got a lot of action because I wanted to train at least a little more to prepare for my bicycle tour next week.
Said, did and I ran with my racing bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what happened in every city (this time: Thank you Krefeld!).
Glass splitter on the line.
Zack, loud boobs and my back tires wanted to take the rest of the course no longer.
Since I had no real opportunity because of the day of the week to get me a replacement coat and a replacement hose, I had to turn around with half a bad tire and take the first train home.
It was also not technically so bad then, perhaps it is even better if I practice it with the tire change before the bike tour.
But now I'm faced with a question and hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long journey over several days before me, I would get extremely worried about this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, because even the old tires from the predecessor (very nice old man, on the day I came to pick up the bike up to 14 o'clock 120km!) and who had already called it suboptimal because he had been playing with them for years.
But if I think I have to make another tire change when driving 80-90kms, then I think I'm really badly rewarded :D
Now I'm talking to an older man at the train station, who wondered why I shouldn't have had the Marathon Plus tires; they should be inconceivable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are these really so incapacitable?
I have little desire to spend 40€/rip now just to be disappointed.
I also wonder: I have at the moment on the race wheel I think 25x622.
There are also (probably?) at the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me on other tires on a race bike?
The wave side seems absolute to me! Do you prefer the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and loving greetings!
Self-adhesive against tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old was on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for unexplained reasons against a middle island and then headed on the counterroad, as the police reported.
There it came to a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old car was then slammed against a tree and the man was stuck in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old companion were seriously injured in the accident and taken to nearby hospitals.
Yes, we've deleted all the books we've just authorized and loaded new books

After the release of our new High End broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would be brought back to adulthood.
SOLO 15 is called the new Sprössling and remembers the large models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this construction proposal, an appropriately designed foot is included directly in order to lift the speaker to the right position.
This has no influence on acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the circumstances at home.
The SOLO 15 is very well suited for people who have a more subordinated role to play, but an exceptionally high level is to be achieved.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to produce almost unfiltered such a large sound pressure level.
However, this does not mean that SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it has grown considerably and is extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
Tonal was tuned the SOLO 15 with a slight elevation.
This is generally used for broadband bands to optimize the high frequency of significantly increasing bonding.
The SOLO 15 has a very clear and fine sound.
Lightly rotated outwards can reduce the height range and thus make the sound image warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music is in the optimal stereo dreich messerscharf and amazingly precise.
The extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide a fine dynamic looking for the same.
The SOLO 15 complements not only our SOLO series, but expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our construction sets, it is recommended to start thinking about the final vision of the speaker in order to plan appropriate changes in the construction.
For example, if you want to supply the case, the lowering of the speaker needs to be adjusted accordingly, as the furnier again supplies material.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the construction market), you should first drill an 8 mm hole into the floor plate at the appropriate place to run the cable there without any problems.
With the help of an upper phrase, the speaker opening in the front is now followed, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used together later.
At the back this opening should be provided with a 45° phase in order to make the opening area of the speaker box as large as possible.
The four bending points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the phase as shown in the picture "Detail Phase".
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two sides on a flat surface.
On these, the back wall, the ceiling, the front and the ground are raised.
The three suspensions should also be used and glued.
The suspensions can vary in material strength if necessary, for example, if you want to recover from the construction market for finished performance instead of producing 16 mm MDF itself.
The next step will be on the second page.
Then all the plates of the foot follow, that is, the two sides, as well as the front.
By means of an appropriate hole loop or forest drill, the opening of the bass reflex tube as well as the connection clamp on the back wall is facilitated.
Then you use a round hair to wrap all the edges of the actual box.
The upper side of the footboard can also be rounded.
Then the foot plate is firmly attached to the foot of the housing and added with long wooden screws.
It follows the marking and drilling (2,5-mm drills) of the bending points of the loudspeaker case and the connection clamp.
After the wooden dust has been cleaned (suffering/blowing), you start by laying the cable.
The simplest way is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
The entire and short-cut cable is pushed through the 8 mm drilling in the foot to the terminal opening and it can stand about 30 cm out there.
In the upper part of the box, the cable is brought to the speaker opening and also lets it hang loose.
The frequency range is then prepared and used.
The frequency range construction plan, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be taken from the following document: assembly instructions Weiche Solo 15.
If the frequency range is installed and the connection terminal is bolted, the 8 mm cable opening is closed inside the box, which is not fully closed yet.
With the 35 mm BASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot stickers on the opening and close them.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the closure accordingly.
Now the damping is followed by a description.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected to the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus line (marked cable) must be arranged at the pluspol of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened and inserted to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube).
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely divided into the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex canal should be kept free.
Can I give up an order now and start delivering first in June?
> Hello to all,
> finally we can announce that this year we will also reorganise the OSCAST!
> Unfortunately, for well-known reasons, it is not possible to get more than four people into the studio, which means a higher planning effort and explains the short term of the announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people per switch, so we will chase the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still before pandemic – yet we'll give everything to accompany the Oscars as entertainingly as possible.
> It will be released at about 0:30.
Have a cold drink, plan a good meal and make yourself ready for a long, but very interesting night.
