Black box in your car?
While American road planners, destroying the hive system, are struggling with the lack of wealth, many people are looking at its solution in a small black box, which fits safely on your car's dashboard.
This device, which tracks every mile driven by the motorbike and transmits that information to the authorities, has now become the subject of a controversial effort for Washington and the State Planning Office to fund the main streets of the United States.
As a general rule, there has been a sudden and profound debate and lively arrangements, such as the Hive Plan.
You have been able to keep track of the miles you have been driving, and possibly the location you have been driving - and then use this information to generate a tax bill - to allow the government to use these black boxes to add support to the library environment groups.
Tea party's on fire.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Association is also very concerned about the confidentiality of various types.
While Congress did not agree on whether to act on the future, many countries are not waiting.
They're looking for ways in which they can go in the next decade to pay for every mile on the highway.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black boxes for the test drive, including some GPS monitoring.
It's really essential to our country.
"It's not a matter of being chosen by us," says Hamson Ikhrata, the executive director of the Southern California government, who is planning to start tracking every mile designated by motorists in California by 2025.
We're going to change the way we're paid.
It's a technology to do that.
The main reason for this is that the country's high-trust fund has become almost a waste of money, which comes from the payment of gas-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-supply-sed-supply-s-supply-supply-s.
Americans don't buy any gas before.
Now a gallon gas car is already running more miles.
There has been no increase in federal tax for the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Because of the high value of gas, government taxes also prevent money from increasing.
Transport policy at the University of Minnesota, says specialist Le Monique, "gasing is not entirely compatible."
His government has recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test the anti-monetary payment system.
They say, "It'll work out as the most logical option in the long run."
Wongs call it a mile-based user shell.
It's not surprising that this idea is pleasing to urban donors, because it can be changed in ways that can help reduce greenhouses and reduce greenhouse gases, for example.
California's planners are interested in this system while they are developing strategies to meet the goals set out in the state's global warming laws.
But the chairman of the Home Transport Committee, Rap. Bill Shuster (A.P.A.) also considers the black box the most long-acting option.
Free sellers in the Regen Foundation are also on the side of per mill payment by the driver.
Adrian Moore, the president of the police in Reygen, said, "It's not just going to the blind pits."
People are paying more directly for what they're getting.
The campaign has also been supported by two former U.S. transport officials, who in 2011 agreed to move forward from Congress to the per-mille payment in their report.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million test project last year, involving 10,000 cars.
But working on the concerns of rural planners, who were representing people who needed a lot more mile to go to work or go to town every day, Sadan's leader concluded the proposal there.
Yet many kingdoms and cities are moving in this direction themselves.
It has the most desirable Oregon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest use.
These drivers will soon pay for Miles Salk, rather than throw the kingdom away.
Nevada has already completed the initial investigation.
New York City is also moving in this direction.
Illinois is testing with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 Association, which includes the 17 state transport departments (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida) with the former Cebbards, are studying how they can implement this change.
This idea was not supported in all places.
In Nevada, where some time ago the device was installed on the cars of 50 voluntary drivers, the drivers were very impatient to think that the government could monitor every step of it.
In the Nevada Transport Division, the leaders of the strategic and operational management, Alauddin Khan, said "big brother and other things of the same kind were the main concerns."
It's not what people wanted.
As the investigation continued, the NSA of Nevada warned on its website: "It will be quite easy to transform this device into a complete tracking device."
There is no need to develop a large, unmanaged technological framework that needs to be expanded to keep a record of each person's daily arrival.
Nevada is one of many states that is trying every bit to obtain it, with the help of which the Kingdom can get a description of how many miles of cars are running every day, but not where and when they are running.
Cain said, "If you can do this, people can feel more easily."
The search for this initiative has brought some government agencies to a small California startup called True Miles.
This company was not in the business of helping drivers.
It was attempting to get into the market as soon as the auto got sick, where the drivers had to pay for their mail.
But the device that is currently being checked is very nice to have high-level planners because it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is being uploaded over a certain amount of time by modem.
True Miles said, "If you don't track people's speed and their place, they'll be more willing to take this way."
These early Kingdom programs have made some major mistakes.
There are very few ways to do this, and there are very few ways to intervene.
In Oregon, planners are using different options to give different drivers.
They can choose a device from the gpss device or from the gpss device.
Or they can no longer choose to take any devices, but the averages that the citizens of the Kingdom can choose to give on the basis of miles.
Other places hope that this can be sold to concerned citizens by providing less and more facilities on the device.
In New York City, transport authorities are trying to develop a taxing device that will also make it possible to pay parking meters, "pay according to your drive" insurance, and create real-time data collection from other drivers that can be used to save from motor vehicles.
The city's planning document states, "The benefits of motor-wheeling will attract participation in it."
Although, some transport planners are surprised that maybe the entire discussion on payment is a big distraction.
Metropolitan transport agencies in the San Francisco Valley region have said that increasing congress gas taxes can help to cope with the problem of the Davalia High Trust Fund.
Additional one-time or annual salary may be applied to drivers of hybrids or other cars, whose vehicles do not use much gas to pay for their proper share.
Randy Rentseller said, "When Espirin can work, what basic surgery is needed for her."
If we do, millions of car drivers will be concerned about their privacy and many other things.
According to the police, his death is due to drowning.
In fact, the police have taken his friend for a bribe to hide the stuff from him.
The police have submitted the final report of the death trial to the court.
On August 26th, the police seized Iqbal, who lived in the royal garden of the Zelam Sea.
His relatives accused him of murder, because his cell phone and other objects were missing.
In the report, the police reported that the dead man's phone and sim's phone were tested and found to be being used by a woman in Soura.
The woman said in question that she had been given this phone by a relative of hers.
He also lived in the royal garden. He was a friend to the nations.
And it came to pass on August 25th, when they had washed in the water, that they came to Zelem, with the Gentiles.
And the people put on their garments, and laid all their vessels upon the edge of the sea; and they went away to drink of the smoke of the sea.
When he returned, the Gentiles weren't there, but he had a change of clothing.
Rohal sought the Gentiles, but they could not find him.
He picked up his cell phones, watches, and other items and kept them for his use.
He didn't tell anyone that the nations were drowned.
The police have told the court that the death of the Gentiles is due to drowning, and that it is confirmed in Postmartam.
In fact, Rohal is taken into custody under 404 rivers to hide the objects of truth and death.

The Indian team, inspired by the devastating victory they won last March, will have to take control of the series with their goal of winning the seventh and last in Australia's M Chinsamy Stadium.
Because of the rain, India had to win the Nagpur Forests in order to remain in Syria after the continuous two forests had been drowned, and its bats gave it a record of the attack, which was equivalent to 2-2 in the Sierra.
Team India has achieved more than 350 targets in Sierras twice, and once again it will be the responsibility of the team to move on.
The Indian bullabazi is now on the verge and the greatest targets are being set in front of him.
Rohit Sharma, head dust, abrasive coal and acandora lions are in a violent form, but the team will also be especially expected from the Uvaraz lion, Suresh Rana and Ruvindra Jadja.
As far as the opening issue is concerned, the team has received a greeting that makes it easier to use the rest of the victims with a firm share.
In Jaipur and Nagpur he had given the return to play without any pressure while sharing in the opening.
On the third issue, the fog is now being regarded as a reality for the future.
But many cricket poets have given them a better covenant than ever.
The next week, the 25-year-old storms have taken 17 centuries, of which India won in 16.
By pursuing the goal, they have an average of over 80.00 and they stand as best finishers.
The top three bubbles in India are in strong form, but these three may also be damaging to the highly dependent team.
Rana and Uvaraz were flying bad in the last match.
Uvaraz hasn't even been able to open accounts in two matches in Serge.

Dr. Ziandra Singh, a member of the voice of the National Activist, and keynote speaker, said Pakistan is working on a new policy to bring terrorists in the direction of peace.
The lion, referring to the report of the secret agencies, said here again on Friday that Pakistan is insisting that it is going to prepare for the invasion of terrorists in its training camps near 2000.
That's why he'll never let peace be on the border.
Pakistan is still a bilge when it comes to the destruction of the exiles in Kashmir.
Referring to the Pakistani tour of tourists last year, Bezpa's leader said that the ISIS Chief Lieutenant General Jahr al-Ilam, the military, the Taliban sorghum Hafiez Seed and Seed Salahudin believed that terrorism would be rescinded in 2014.
Pakistan has taken this promise seriously.
The slaughter of the soldiers at the border is part of the strategy of slaughter, of the Sambas, and of the Harrananites.
In such a situation, Zeppa, the leader of the government, calling for the end of military privileges in the state, said that such things are also humanistic until there is lasting peace in the state.
These give the anti-national elements a taste.
They insisted that the military of the leaders should be stopped from talking about the fallout of the security forces.
Snow Dan is ready to "cooperation" with Germany on U.S. Watch
Edward Snow Dan, U.S. Secretary of State, has announced that Berlin is ready to testify to parliament in Germany if the US National Security Agency and its directors, Keith Alexander, fail to respond to their activities.
German M.P. Hans Christian Stro Belle met Mr. Snow Dan Seguruvar in Russia, where he was given refuge to speak about the witness in Germany.
Sunsad presented a letter to the media in Berlin on Friday, by Mr. Snow Dan, saying: "Although the results of my efforts are clearly positive, my government believes that there is a disunity as a group - change, and does not provide any protection that attempts to criminalize the political speech with the charges of the gondad. "
Although, telling the truth isn't a crime.
In a letter, Mr. Snow Dan said that they believe that the support of the international community can rule the US government to abolish their criminal charges.
The U.S. Justice Department's round of charges includes the theft of secrets and government property.
Hans Peter Frederick, German Interior Minister, told Online Time: "Mr. Snow Dan is ready to talk to the German authorities, so we have to find ways to make it possible."
The relationship between America and Germany has come under pressure because the NSA claims that the Chancellor Angela Markel's phone has been bugged.
Thomas Opérman, the vice president of the National Committee, kept confidential information. He said that if Mr. Snow Dan was a witness, he should take it as a witness "without completely destroying relations with America and putting them at risk," he said.
Mr. Bell, a smile from the Green Party of Germany, posted a photo of himself with Mr. Snow Dan on Twitter.
He was on his way to Russia with two German journalists.
Mr. Bellene said that, according to the former NSA instigator, if they left Russia, they would not be able to return to Snow Dan Russia.
If Snow Dan testified in Germany, he'd be "safe" there, which would require assurances, the smell said.
Mr. Snow Dan said in his letter that "they had to face a terrible and persistent campaign" they had to leave home.
While they said that the world is happy and defaulted by comprehensive responses to "the work of the democratic expression."
The United States and the United States, together with the world's citizens, have the figures of the mystery of a comprehensive public service superintendent of a non-profit system.
The letter extends a proposal to cooperate with German authorities "when the problems of the human situation have been solved."
Frontier Airlines Carry - On Baggage to Land
In Frontier Airlines, there is a plan to charge $100 for passengers on their flight board to store equipment.
In Frontier Airlines there is a plan to start a charge for $100 for a car - on bag and this will put $2 for coffee or release, although Wednesday announced that travellers can keep a full box.
The new car - On-Shulk Overhead Bin for Bags, therefore, small bags under the seat will still be sold:
Frontier said that $25 would be charged if paid in ADVANCE, would have to wait $100 if passengers waited to pay while they were on the gate.
Frontier spokesperson Kate O'Malley said that 100 percent of passengers have to get to care for their responsibilities.
"We don't want to charge him," he said.
Airlines started charging for the first and second test bags in 2008.
Those who are trying to save from the storm fill as much as they can do in the car - on the bag, which is in the top box, means there is often little space in this box.
There's a way to get less for travelers on the shell board.
O'Malley said it's not really about adding new charges.
It has become more difficult for the most faithful customers to find overhead bin instead of frontier.
Passengers who purchase tickets on their airline website should not be allowed to do this.
This means that the next person on the line can give 100 dollars for a similar bag, while a traveler on a frontier gate can get a free bag.
O'Malley said that Frontier's website and check their processes are being changed before they get the gate to make sure the passengers know about the Facebook.
The new face-on-face of Frontier will not start to warm, even though a date has not been set.
Travelers often find dissatisfaction with the Baggage Shrew and other shrews, but the air service likes them.
They argue that money is spent to manage baggage, and those who want to serve should pay for it.
On Wall Street, the bagage's face sees many as a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of the flight after years of loss.
Most of them don't even touch the car - on bag bag.
Spirit Airlines Inc. began his career three years ago, and his partner, Allegiant Air.
It's the Wizz Air of another Hungarian airline with such a shell, which is said by the airline advisor Sorensen, and which tracks the Ad-On Face.
He said that Spirit's career-on-shulk brings $50 million in a year that was estimated in the December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former director of Midwest Airlines, recently flew into the Spirit and the passengers have had to face an unusual bag face on the gate but have won.
"The boarding process that I had seen in my airline career was easy," he said.
I was hoping to see the toothbrush and a fight outside the gate.
"The plane was full and they said it got up tickety-split."
Frontier is also tracking coffee, tea, let go, or the $2 worth of Spirit for juice.
Frontier Nekaha, who will leave, or take juice they can keep the whole box, and this free coffee will only be given once.
It'll still take away the water.
At the US Airways Summary in 2008, they tried to charge for drinking substances, but after the passengers complained seven months later they moved back and followed any other main airline after it was there.
Frontier's passengers if they don't buy directly from the airline, it's your new effort to run frontier's steps to charge bribes on your own website.
Airlines pays the online travel vendor Orbitz like this from $10 to $25 for every other ticket.
That's why all airlines have been encouraged to run passengers to buy them directly instead of going through an online travel agency.
Frontier though, has moved on in this area.
In September, a number of frequent flights began to flow half a mile away to customers who bought an online travel agency from these people.
On Wednesday, it reduced the Miles Ward to 25 percent of Trip Miles.
So, an online travel agency purchased from a 1,000-mile frontier trip would be 250 miles away.
It is also that they allow you to select your seat in advance for direct purchase from the Frontier website.
There's a loyal customer base in your home city in Frontier's Denver, but it's getting low and it's losing money.
The fall of 9 percent in the kingdom and its flight capacity in the first trimester has decreased by about 13 percent, according to the continued financial results of the Corporate Parent Republic Air Holdings Inc.
They're trying to set Frontier's money as part of the sales of the Republic Airlines.
NSB charged hackers with "Internal Errors" instead of crashing the website
The Secret National Security Agency told Friday that our website had been closed for a few hours because of some lack of technology, not because of hackers, as some people have claimed online.
In an e-mail address, the secret agency said, "Today the night was not reached by NSA.gov for several hours, which was due to an internal error during the pre-specified update."
The problem will be solved this evening.
It is not true that this obstacle was caused by the widespread denial of service [D.O.S.] due to the attack.
On-line server trackers found that the NSA website was closed for at least six hours in the evening, and for some users the site is not yet available.
N.S.A. spokesperson told A.C. News that the Agency's internal, sensitive network was not in agreement with "even".
The speaker said that no classified information was in danger.
At least one hectivist group has claimed online that they are responsible for blocking the website of DNS by means of a D.O.S. attack.
The CD-ROM attack is designed so that the target web site will send traffic so much longer until the server is overloaded.
This is an unexpected cyber strategy and the target of attacks does not differ from the internal network of the target system.
Formerly extremely secretive N.S.A., which has never been called the "No such agency", has become the subject of discussion between the general public and the discussion of events of foreign and domestic social events in recent months, which have been the subject of a collectively disrupted prior N.S.A. secretary Edward Snoden's covert N.S.A. files being stolen from the Agency and confiscated.
Because of this growing debate about the Agency, there have been allegations that this event was the result of a marked cyber operation after the night event.
A beautiful expression was presented in line with the phrase 'one and all poetry' showing consistency in times of the past and today.
It has been shown in what ways a teacher is forced to walk in the wrong way.
The drama's famous St. Joseph Inter College's participant in the main guest guest house Mr. Walmiki, the president of the camp Pashtoga, the Naresh Consul and the Power Lion united.
The drama showed the similarity between the philosophy of the Dwaper Age and the current circumstances of a professor Arvind.

In the drama, the light system Youth Colorist Ziandra C. King and the design of set had been made by Hemhan Kumar.
In the above ceremony, the cultural, physical and cultural contributions from the apta were given a variety of surprises.
It was given to the King of the Kingdom by the President of the Urdu of Lions, Dr. Jamsedpuri, the top journalist, Shanbunatha Skulla, and the colourful Vicentra.
Srinedra Sharma, Rakesh Kushik, Abid Rizavi and others contributed to the success of the organization's work mandates.
As a delivery of air, the bombing in Bombardier's defense, the collapse in orders
Canada's aircraft and train stationer Bombardier Inc informed Thursday of a 15 per cent decrease in net profits, in its third team in its train unit and less by air command and prosecuting.
The Montreal-based Bombardier also presented no flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft to release or complete its major commercial service schedule from the next September.
About a month and a half after the first flight of the test plane, it's only blown three times, the question is whether the test is on the track.
The result was lower than expected and Share Toronto Stock Exchange sent for more than 8 percent of the slideshow.
Cameroon Dorsen, a senior analyst with the National Bank Finance, has reduced his rating for "the field display" from "mort" to "the stock is limited for the next one or two weeks."

We'll get a new command for Bombardier CSeries as progress of the flight testing program.
Although, if no new order is announced in the coming months, the market will likely be suspicious.
Bombardier is expected to be able to cut it down at the end of the Boing and Airbusian market.
The first test was unveiled in March and was flew for the first time in September after a month.
Possible Kreta waits for the results of the flight test for the new Jetliner fuel efficiency and the company's claims to be valid for survival, but, for example, for CSeries, there is a firm order of up to 177.
There are 403 full orders and prohibitions available with 15 customers and operators.
Chief official Pierre Bodoin believed that Bombardier would meet its 300 firm orders target from the time of the first commercial use of the jet.
Authorities assured analysts and teachers the media that the program was running according to the index.
"The investigation was on the ground for a long time in the expected comparison," Bodoin said in a conference call, adding it to the ground testing and software update interval.
Every creator makes a different way to schedule.
We've decided to fly a first flight and update a period and say what we've done.
That's why the flight program will all be through.
The other part of the five investigation planes, with the following shortly, is expected to fly in the coming weeks, the company said.
However, analysts are suspecting that customers can start a CSeries flight within 12 months after their first flight.
Bombardier said that this service list (EIS) has been appreciated and will provide an update in the next few months.
"This slow pace of air testing -- although with Bombardier's internal index in line -- confirms our opinion in Kiprost will be pushed into Q1/15," Dorsen said.
For the third trimester ended September 30th, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million a year ago, or $172 million per share, or $172 million, or nine cents per share.

Backlog on the Eurospace device was $32.9 billion on 30 September, no change since December 31.
"Eurospace, the results were on the line with our guidance, but the following series were disillusioned with the situation of the market as a whole," Bodoin said.
A fall of 13 percent in the Eurospace Empire in 2 billion dollars.
Bombardier said that the world's largest train maker, the DV, had an increase of about 11 percent for the $2.1 billion in the government.
In the transport unit, orders were backed up by $32.6 billion from about 30 September, on average 31 December.
The transport sector was also influenced by the points of execution in some large relationships.
The officials said that the new guidance would be provided in the fourth issue.

Brazil's Embreira S.A., the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the nearest opponent of Bombardier, reported a 10 per cent fall in the three-year prize.
New research has found that we work with all honesty and dedication in the morning.
They don't lie to anyone. They don't understand how to steal or deceive.
But in the evening, we change our mind and we start going against the rules.
Researchers at Harvard University and Uto's David Ex-School of Business have provided some interesting facts.
According to researchers, without stress in the morning, we value moral values, but as soon as evening falls because of fatigue or more pressure.
Searchers used two for it.
He told some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For example, people had to tell that the point is more on the left or on the right.
It was said to those who were part of it, "If they had given false answers, they would have received back their dues."
This experiment showed that the people used between 8 and 12 in the morning did not make a mistake and responded correctly.
It was there when people were used between noon and noon at 6:00 p.m., that they deliberately ignored their principles.
This has helped researchers to prove that the desire for money in the morning does not make any difference to our honesty, but in the evening we stop giving morals.
This research is published in the latest issue of Psychological Science.

Mr. Big, the original lawyer of the Cocaine who secretly reported the police investigation to Mr. Big.
42 - year - old Bashart told criminal Neal Scarboro in the kitchen
The president thought that people could find out about his secret death cure.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool Crown Court
The lawyer at the top of the rescue party, who told Mr. Big about the main police investigation, because he was afraid of his dead drug will be known to people about his secret illness, has been working for three years.
After 42 years of drought, after agreeing on his cocaine habit, the accused criminal Neal Scarboro provided sensitive confidential information about his drug-related investigation.
This president, who was nicknamed "Bash", and who was praised by criminals as "Top Brief", was arrested by the police in Scarboro in 2011 after the police surveillance operation, which he represented in the previous Narcotics Trial.
The authorities had seen Scarboro, 32-year-old Blackburn, Lancashire, holding three cocaine bags in the lawyer's house, while he had gone out with his employees for Lo Society Diner.
After receiving cocaine from the hair of the dentist, his buttocks, and his credit card, he found that the drugs of the dentist's category A were "regular users".
During the eight-month period between August 2011, he sought information about the arrest of two persons by Scarboro and his associate.
The police were monitoring all four incidents as part of the heroin and cocaine group's main test at the time, which was operating in Lancashire, Kumbria, Mercecid, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 other people who were sent to prison after more than 200,000 pounds of heroin and cocaine during several prints by the police.
Forty-two years old, while he was reporting to the guilty, for he was afraid that the people might not know the plague of his cocaine.
In Blackbound, the state law firm Forbes Solitaires was in the process of dealing with failure in the Liverpool Crown Court for three weeks after the trial had been found guilty in two cases after the trial.
He agreed to keep cocaine in the previous hearing.
The lawyer's bad times began when the police found out that he was regularly on the phone with Dita since February 2011.
Two spies followed him and saw him coming into the den and holding more than 60 per cent of the lawyer's bin in the Black Golf Glove.
After being given the cure, Scarboro was regularly on the phone with Dita, who had gone out for money in the Blackhorn Rover Football Stadium, Ewood Park.
When the lawyer got home, he found out that he had a dead man there, and he had a nine-time conversation between them.
It was heard in the court that he had been found "regular user" of cocaine in an examination of the hair, buttocks and credit cards of the A category for a drug that had been stolen.
Denta was later arrested, but he refused to use cocaine and said that he was talking to a related dealer because he was his client and said that their discussion was about "general privileges".
During his arrest, the Dita tried to remove her wallet and many credit cards, but they had been beaten, and her hair was taken.
In the police testimony, he said he was running his office with his place of work, and his clients were calling his home for regular business.
After the arresters told them what Joshua knew about them, the court hearing said that the dentist was calling the main providers, some of whom he had previously presented the case.
Anny White from the planning party said: "The criminal president should know best not to break the law."
There's a charge of misappropriating your position as a criminal on Mr. Denta's behalf, of making a lot more connection to your specific client.
We're not talking about a common drug dealer, we're not talking about a drug dealer who's giving his lawyer a cure.
They will surely have some talk, for he was a lawyer.
But he went beyond his limit of relationship with the lawyer-client.
He forced the police's investigation as far as possible to keep them able to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Dents were not honoring their profession, they were demeaning.
He made a lot closer than a certain client, especially Scarboro, and he allowed the agreement to be made with his freedom.
Denta denied any wrong action and claimed: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, who I am not, and if I wanted to inform Mr. Scarboro, I would not wait for 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.
But after the hearing, Lukashair Police High Representative Lee Hallstead said: "Mr. Denta started to get treatment from organized criminals, at the time they turned themselves into criminals."
Because of the lack of cocaine, they have reached an extreme agreement and have become much weaker against the objectives of former members of organised crime groups, who used it to obtain important information related to the police investigation.
Leaders must maintain the highest standard of faithfulness, and fill people with faith and self-confidence.
Mr. Denta has cheated with this faith and has tried to save her profession from the horizon.
The serious and organised crime unit of Lukashair has investigated Mr. Dett, in which three cases have been found guilty of maintaining cocaine and now obstructing the path of justice, which exposes our resistance to bringing criminals to court.
This matter shall be for a warning to the guilty, that no man is far from the law.
We'll find you and present you to the court.
14 years after Scarboro was found guilty of committing heroin, cocaine and gang rape.
Fifty other members of the group were sent to Karavas for a total of 153 years for drug crimes.
On his website, Dita gave questions and answers about herself, in which she said that her fantasy job would be to be a lawyer for a death penalty client in the United States, to be a guest of Muhammad Ali, and to be motivated by inequality for their work.

U.N. has set new goals to tackle poverty
The United Nations is about to begin its work on the new target group, which will replace all-day development goals, which were launched 12 years ago to deal with global poverty.

Mozambique’s Security Concerns Increases as Strong Qualities
Thousands gathered in Central Maputo, with a statue of the President of Mozambique, Samora, who was rolling down on them for peace in a deplorable public demonstration.

For two weeks, the conflict between government armies and Ré Nomo has been reported almost daily, more than 20 years after a peace settlement.
Rey Nomo was once part of the efforts to destabilize the country’s free government as part of his efforts to establish white government in Rhodesia and the colourful revolution of the South African government.
After the peace agreement of 1992, it became a refugee party.
Analysts believe it is not possible to return to the country's fully developed struggle, but recent events have depressed foreign investors and local people.
The dams are rising for a faster economic system that could bring some of the companies with Eni from more than $50bn of the next year's investment in the vast optimizing gas storage and the coal storage.
The ruling Frelimo Party, the main political force since 1975, and the Renomo Party blame each other for tension.
Rey Nomo says the government launched a recent attack on its members in Sofa La Land on 17 October, a traditional Rey Nomo fortress.
In the wake of the attacks on the former rebels, the government forces again attacked the Renomo sites and told the Financial Times of Afonso Dhaka, the leader of the group, Fernando Mong, to try to kill Renomo's spokesman.
The government accuses Rea Nomo of attacking soldiers for a trigger.
President Armando Gybuzan has urged to ignore the concerns about instability.
Mr. Gybuzan told the French News Agency on Wednesday that Mr. Dhakama had seen himself as a "lost" "whatever his armies have been trying to prove is that they can apply their own decision to the government."
Free Limbo and Ray Nomo both insist that they want to escape the war.

They told FT that the settlement is not being honored by Free Limo
Our sight must return to the settlement talk, but seriously," Mr. Mongane said.

Mr. Mong says Mr. Gibuzenko-- who left office next year at the end of his second term of office-- wants to destroy the country's democracy.

Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New York
People can argue that Standup Comedy was born in New York City in the United States: about a hundred years ago, the song director Frank Fee, who worked as a festival teacher in the Pales Theatre, began to hear people in the crowd whistling through conversation.
Fae's research has expanded over the years, most recently in New York Comedy Fostive.
This year's 10th anniversary was celebrated and celebrated by Caroline Harsh, the founder of the stand-up organization, which included more than sixty shows in small clubs and big theaters.
Hirsch says, "Most of these were seen in the Carolines, and were very successful, to the extent that they became too large to be promoted to the club."
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's program includes the presence of Wanda Sykes, Katie Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the annual music and comedy benefits for military personnel in Madison Square Garden, "Stand Up for Heroes", which included other artists including Bruce Springstein, John Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby.
The Commodity world has also expanded, along with the enlargement of the festival.
Many of the comedians participating in this year's celebration have come from non-traditional means, such as comedy Central, F.X., and small networks such as Spike.
Nick Crowl, DP-Cable Sitcom (F.X.C.) came to the top of the "Di Leg" with a fantasy football theme, and now their own comedy Central Sketch show.
Jenny Slate is a member of Setard Night Live and Parks and Recreation, although they are best known for their virtual video series "The Marshall Battle Show On."
Other young comedians with different voices, including Crowl and Slate, are the products of the American comedians, whose voice is completely disillusioned.
One of the main attractions of the festival will be a witness: Talk to Larry David of David Steinberg:
Steinberg had begun to work as a standup comedian, but they have become nominee television and film directors, as well as illegal comedy historians.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show entitled "Site Down Comedy by David Steinberg" on TV Land.
This meeting will be in downtown Manhattan, downtown.
Steinburg said, "The city is definitely in the comedy d.N.A. of all Larry's actions."
They were telling me that when they were here, they would sometimes go between the two buildings and think to themselves that if I ever lost all my money, I would stay here.
Oil falling to $96 per barrel
There is a report offset that shows concern for the cost of oil that continues on Friday, bringing more supplies than ever before, where the hungry area of power building is becoming stronger in China.
For the delivery of December, the Benemark American Red New York Market Exchange was down 14 cents in electronic trading in Europe by the late morning at $96.24 per ball.
5.8 percent fell for the month of October, Thursday fell 39 cents.
Heavy oil supplies are high on the price in recent weeks.
Energy Department told Wednesday that the U.S. supply increased 4.1 million barrels last week
Over five weeks, the supply has increased by over 25 million barrels.
But one suggestion of strong demand has been made by Ezafa that two reports on the Chinese construction have arrived on Friday.
This shows that Kiwikas can continue to strengthen China's economic recovery after the last 7.8 per cent of the third trimester of two decades.
Brent Crud also fell 26 cents from the pool on the ICE exchange in London by US refineries for International Green Oil.
The court has blocked the activity of the New York Police Department's pause and gaming policy
On Thursday, a U.S. Court of Appeal ordered a judge to oppose the changes and remove the judge from the case for the interruption of the New York Police Department and the game program.
The judge of the U.S. Circuit Court 2 And said the judge's verdict would be prolonged by an appeal through the city.
In August, a violation of the constitution led to the arrest and interrogation of people in the city of justice.
The City Police Department has also decided to appoint an observer to assist with its policy and related training program changes, its conclusions and its medical orders have been appealed.
The Court of Appeal heard arguments on Tuesday on the motion.
The Court of Appeal has said that since he has agreed on the need for a judge to avoid the presence of bias in a part of a series of media testimony, and that he must be removed from the case by misdemeanour of the behaviour of American judges by the public, it is necessary to be held public to review the case of the Court of Justice.
The judge ruled that the police authorities wrongly violated the civil rights of thousands of people by focusing on black and Spanish men with their pause and play program.
He has appointed an external monitor to monitor major changes in policies, training and monitoring, including financial improvements, and he is most shut down where a pilot program is ordered to examine the body’s clothing cameras in some areas.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of collecting the names and addresses of people whose cases had been dismissed after a police stop.
An oral argument on the city's appeal is indicated for some time after March 14, 2014.
The pause and play device has been discussed with civil authorities.
The pause and gaming policy has been in some way around the decades, but most black and Spanish men, the free mayor Michael Bloomberg's government has recorded a dramatic ban on growth in order to raise all the time in 684330 to 2011.
One trial was conducted by four men in 2004 by all the small numbers and became a class action case.
The supporters of the NYPD's pause and play show have said that improper behaviour will end with another more credible and effective police force that can influence the use of the police department's policy.
Opponents say the changes will reduce police mobility, but crime, money corruption and not over the past decade will solve a major problem of police force pressure by thousands of authorities after the collapse.
The judge has noted that the pause and the game did not end, which is satisfactory, but had improved the implementation of the NYPD stop.
There were many in the training of the gods, and of the priests, and of the priests, and of the Levites, and of the Levites, and of the Levites, and of the Levites.

Kolson used the phone hacking to confirm the secret information
The former editor of the News of the World, Andy Collins, has been charged with using "phone hacking, surveillance, and amena-samana" to confirm a so-called secret information about their relationship with Charles Clark's home.
Projector Andrew Addis ku.C. told Old Bally that the news of The World had heard in May 2005 a wrong complaint that Clark was in contact with his "attractive Special Adviser" Hannah Polby.
According to the court, the newspaper appointed private investigator Glenn Mulkair to hack into Paulby's Waissamel and to "hold the male" but Colson also called and left Waissamel.
Mr. Addis said that "the intention of the opposing party is that Mr. Colson, who is now the editor of N.O.T.B., is not known to stand outside people's homes and watch them, but they have articles in front of people, see how people react to it."
They said that N.O.T.B. used three ways to investigate matters: telephone hacking, surveillance, and amena-samena.
The third was the editor himself.
Clearly, they knew other ways, of course they knew about surveillance.
What about the first?
Did they know about phone hacking?
They say, no, we say, "Yes, they did."
The complaint about Clark's relationship was first presented by the A.T.D.W.F. Bureau, when a young woman in Susser Polby said, "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
In August 2006, Waissamel’s tape was tapped at least three times from the home of Malchair.
Investigators also found entries on the personal investigator's computer that had been named "Project" by Sister Polby and their sister.
At the time they were being tested, they were being contacted by their father-in-law, who called and asked for information about them.
During this time, former chief reporter Nevillei Thurlbeck and former reporter James Wederup saw the surveillance of the arrival of Sister Polby.
On June 18, 2005, Colson told them through a Waysmell: "I have found a store that we are planning to run tomorrow, which I would definitely like to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Addis said that colson's involvement in this case is in the other important parties, such as former House Secretary David Blonquet.
The court heard Thursday that Colson spoke to Mr. Blonquet about marital relations with a married woman, while he was then looking at the case of co-addictive Rebecca Brooks who were married.
Colson and Brooks refused to disagree with other people between October 3 200 and August 9th 2006.

Late in August, a German police helicopter raided the U.S. Trade Ambassador at the financial capital of Germany.
At the direction of the BfV, the German Home Office, the mission was to take a picture of the U.S. headquarters roof, which is less than five miles [5 km] from the European Central Bank and the basicsbank.
The German media told BfV to express hope to identify the presence of Licensing antenna and signaled a trade between the German Foreign Ministry in the United States and Berlin..
James Clipper, director of the U.S. National Secret, stressed that the U.S. is committed to stealing the secrets of its foreign secret capabilities "and to increasing international competitiveness for American companies or to increasing their bottom line."
But ever since Edward Snowden, a magician who has become vice-blower, began to tell the American supervisor of his mystery, European governments and business world leaders are no longer sure that the director is not going to keep his word.
The U.S. National Security Agency announced that the oil company in Brazil was spying on Petrobras, and our cloud suppliers, including Google and Yahoo, and Yahoo, were afraid of the emperor’s oversight.
The last thing came when it was found that Chancellor Angela Markel's phone was bugged, probably a decade ago.
If Europe's most powerful people can be noticed, business world leaders are definitely also targeting potential targets.
Snowdon has made close cooperation between US Secret Services and companies transparent.
I think it would be a practice to use these data for mutual benefit.
Oliver Grün, president of BITMI, says "German Awakening," representing small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey published in July by German companies, the United States has now become almost as dangerous as China, when it comes to industrial gambling and data theft.
In all the stories, Mr. Snodon, however, has no evidence to date that America went to the business secrets of foreign companies for its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern about the lack of Internet capabilities of the European Union. And they should try to reduce their dependence on America.
Business world leaders are questioning this.
Someone in the German parliament said we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
Haso Platner, president of the German trade software company SAP, said "It's no way,"
If anyone wanted a strong European IT industry, he would not have let him die 20 years earlier.
All things are vanity and a striving after wind. ”
But the IT industry is everything.
Snodon's report of U.S. technical breakthroughs and Joshua's access has proved to be an attack on some companies that were previously believed to be China's biggest supervisory threat
A major change is taking place in the field of cloud computing, where European officials are more alert to the fact that the data collected in the United States is under the field of law and therefore have become potentially sensitive.
According to a survey carried out by a business organization, Cloud Security Alliance, some 10 percent of non-American members cancelled the plan to use an American-based cloud provider after the release of data on the Prizm mining program.
"We saw a new question that customers had not come a year ago -- that's - my data said is stored? And can you guarantee that it will remain physically in the field of authority?"
Many German authorities argue that the latest reports are only confirming whether they already knew: the powerful government wants to steal their most trusted secrets and data and should be kept under guard at all costs.
It's not a surprise that economic depression is happening.
It's always been.
"It has been a topic for many years, and through the original current discussion, nothing has changed," says Kurt Bock, chief executive of the chemical manufacturer BASF.
The United States is spying on us at commercial and industrial levels, and so do we, because it is in the national interest to protect our business.
Corporate leaders generally don't want about the defense system and it's a benefit to the attacker.
For large companies, the message is being recorded for a long time, even though leaving a shop is not understood by usb stick, or a laptop is not understood to leave in a hotel room to say at least.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the car manufacturer's audio board, says that this is an old system before board meetings because they could not be used as remote hearing devices.
Germany's BfV operator is advised to consider using a simple prepaid cell phone while the Smart Phone is at risk.
The prepaid mobile phone was then dropped.
While small and medium-sized companies are at risk of hacking and monitoring it is a matter of concern.
In Germany, this is a number of companies in the global market in a special place.
"Small and medium-sized companies often lack of experience, workers and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorised access," warns BfV in a report.
America has warned other countries about the financial collapse of its own companies.
According to France The Washington Post, the name of the U.S. national secret in February, followed by Russia and Israel, which is named after China's financial statement for hacking in another of the criminals involved in hacking.
According to a German Blue Chip company board member when it comes to making financial investments, "French is the worst.

The parents of a teenager in Georgia who was killed in the "Unbelieving Disaster" believe that their son was killed
A teenager in Georgia whose dead body was found wrapped up in a restaurant matt in his high school Jim believed that his son had been killed, the family president told the teacher.
Valdosta, G.A., had been arrested in the middle of his high school class in Blychers on January 11th.
London County Sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson was dead in a 'unmarkable accident', but the 17-year-old boy's family refused to do so.
Benjamin Rape, who presented Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told Fox News DotCom that "they must fully believe that their son has been killed."
They don't trust death at all in the way the sheriff told them.
The band said, "They believe that this is beyond the logic of physical law and common sense."
They believe that this conclusion is an excuse for the death of their son or for the protection of people.
They said, "He sent his son back to school with a copy of the book, and he went back to a body bag."
U.S. Prime Minister Michael Muller told Thursday that he was investigating an official investigation into Johnson's death, seeing that many important questions were not answered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his murder a result of some crime?
Mure said these things at a newspaper conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the truth. Let them lead us wherever they please."
My purpose is to bring the truth to life.
They said, "I think that there is an environmental reason for this."
Moore told the reporter that the initial SWAT test showed that Johnson's death resulted from "static SWAT".
According to Maurice, a second saw examination revealed a different cause of death."
They said, "There are many questions to be answered or to be confirmed."
Moore also said that if he finds sufficient evidence to request a criminal or to investigate civil rights in the case of Johnson's death, he will tell the FBI to do so.
Representatives were not immediately available to comment from the London County Sheriff's office when they were contacted.
On Wednesday, the South Georgia judge ordered officials to release all surveillance videos reviewed by investigators.
The boy's parents say they hope that the video footage will give some indication of how his death occurred.
CCD issued child allergy guidance for students
On Wednesday, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines to control children's food allergy in the school.
For the first time, such guidance has been issued by the U.S. government, as the number of children attending school is increasing by the number of children suffering from allergies.
Now in the U.S., each of 20 children has food allergies.
C.D.C. found that between 1997 and 2007, food allergies increased by 18 per cent in children.
This guidance provides information for students on how teachers and workers should be informed about children's food allergy, and how to treat it in the event of an allergic reaction.
Students are also advised to keep the Epinephrine stock in order to cope with potentially life-threatening reactions (anaphylaxis), which is the autoinjector of the Epinephrine brand, which is most commonly used.
The state parliament has recently updated the rules, making it easier for students to keep the Epinephrine stock to a greater extent.
This report also includes a list of common features that are transmitted by children suffering from an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "Something's going on in my tongue," "Something seems to have a hair on my tongue," or "My tongue's going on."
Intersex kids' parents can choose their children's 's sex not determined'
Germany has become the first European Union country to approve the third sex for children born with unclear genes.
Now the newborn children will no longer be given an alternative form of male or female.
Under the new law, parents do not need to declare sex for such children, this law allows them to declare sex on a child's birth certificate "undetermined" or "unspecified".
The purpose of the new law is to reduce the pressure on parents who can make decisions about sexual-specification for newborns in medical care quickly, and to fight discrimination against intersex children.
According to B.C., an intersex person said years later, "I'm not a man, I'm not a woman."
I'm going to be a wound made by doctors, and I'm going to be a pain in the ass.
According to the number of the children of Israel, from a year old and upward, there were neither male nor female.
They are intersexes, part of a group of nearly 60 situations, which involves a study of sexual developmental disorders, this is a common word that is used for unusual qualities, genetics (indicaments or reproduction), or unusually developed sex.
Maybe Wallace Simpson's been intersexing.
The gender identity is still not fully understood, but most experts in the United States believe that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information to specify sex and to do medical treatment, if this happens, to monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before.
In New York City, psychologist Dr. Jack Dresser, who is a specialist in sex issues, said that Germany's new law "seems to be good."
Intersex children create moral misunderstandings.
They said, "There are people who are in a state of great distress, in which there is no need for a physician, but most of them are children."
You can specify only sex without a medical device, and then see how identity develops.
How any sex develops in a child is not very accurate science.
No one can answer properly why.
It's a kind of puzzle why people are homosexual.
In 2011, the European Commission reported that intersex people have been described differently than transsexual or transgender people, because their situation is not related to sex, but is related to its life-form, which is not clearly male or female, but is either composite or is not clearly defined by either.
These characteristics can show themselves secondary sexual perceptions, such as the weight of the muscles, the distribution of the hair, the column and length; primary sexual perception such as reproductive joints and genes; or qualitative structure and hormone.
This report provides insight into the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender individuals in the field of workers, as well as about torture, violence and biased crimes.
Now there are special camps for boys who don't like sex.
Australia and Nepal have already been allowed to mark older people on their official documents as men, women or "third sex".
In June, 52-year-old Australian Nori Me-Walby became the world's first qualified "sexless" person to hold "unspecified" sex for life after the legal appeal was won.
According to the interior ministry, there will also be a third specification for M or F intersex persons as X in the German passport.
According to the news report on France 24, the issues related to sex in the neighbouring country of France are still controversial.
In 2011, French method designers from this strictly Catholic country signed the paper to go back to the school's book "Sex Principles".
The U.S. website's Catholic Online also opposes this German law, saying, "While the world is going to be in a state of gender choice, but not gender activism, we are taking two and more columns in the opposite direction."
In Maryland, the mother of the newborn child also told baby Jon that she would like to see the children specified sex at birth.
He said on the website about parenting, "Beyond extra limits, it's very stressful, especially if you don't even know what your child's sex is."
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, the children born with both genders were called Hermaphrodites (Ubiylingi), which was named after a beautiful Greek god who was blind.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world considered the sex to be a slat that was deleted and could be rewritten.
But now many people are challenging the morals of psychiatry, they understand that sex is complex work, and sometimes even doctors may be wrong, who don't know how children will feel about their sexual specification when they grow up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called "monorogens early in the morning."
When these children were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a therapist.
Dr. John Mani of the University of John Hopkins presented the current principle on the treatment of unexplained children, who considered sex to be insurmountable.
They argued with the word "sex identification" and the argument that social and environmental signs -- how parents raise the child -- interact with the child's genes and hormones to identify him as a man or a woman.
But in a 1966 case, which is known as "John/Joan", the principles became controversial.
He advised a child whose parents had had an accident during the sex sex surgery (surgery), to tie the child up completely and release the child and to be like a red - colored girl.
Dresser said, "Manny presented the matter as a success case, but it didn't happen."
At the age of 15, the child returned as a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he killed himself.
Dresser said some doctors are still "following the same image".
But with the arrival of the Internet in the years after 1990, these sex patients began to face "not happy with the results".
This was the case with 36-year-old author Jim Bruce of Montana, who was born with X.wai.
Doctors did not clearly understand that his sex was small, or his cousin was big, but they were sure he could never live "satisfying life" as a man.
Thus, shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce’s outer limbs and the Andes were extracted by the Shelium-Cycharthsa and his adult daughter.
He was given a female hormone at the age of 12.
She said to ABCNews.com, "I knew I wasn't a girl."
I wasn't happy, but it was very difficult to ask.
At 18 years of age, she was going to become a virus-plasticist.
But feeling unwell and feeling some confusion, he asked for medical records.
It made him know the terrible truth.
When I was born I was bound - and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with D.S.D., which prevented his body from producing enough testosterone, causing his genes to fail to develop properly.
After learning the truth, he became a man back, he took testosterone's food and removed his mouth.
She's been tied up because of Sali-Chithesa.
Today, he explains to people about the intersex people in the interface project organization to make their ideas normal.
However, the California-based state-of-the-art Advocates for Information Switch's Director-General Ani Tamer-Matis expresses concern that Germany's law "calls for Cyprus and Crime."
They say, "Many of the activists think that the German law will motivate parents to make a quick decision and to specify the child as "undetermined."
We are afraid that this will encourage action.
We think it's a better process to specify men or women than to wait.
But we don't know how the law will play its part, so we can only assume.
Tamer-Matis said his organization supports the Australian law because "it allows adults to get to know the third sex."
They said, "The adults should be able to make their own decisions about sex."
The law of Germany is related to specifying it at birth.
It's not a battle to be fought by newborn children at this time.
When they are grown up, they can make their own decisions about their bodies.
But Pittsburgh's breast radiologist Dr. Erlin Baratz, whose daughter suffers from sexual development, and who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said the German law would "give both parents and children strength."
Barathji's daughter was born with traits, but she had a complete androgen insensitivity syndrome called D.S.D.
Because his androgen was faulty in grass, women's perceptions in catheter developed.
He's got Jonny in his body, but he's not pregnant or he's a debunker.
Now 29 years old Kate is married, and Pennsylvania is resident in the Department of Child Psychology.
Although she is bedridden, she expects to be a mother through oral surgery.
Baratz said, "It is a law that enables parents to make their own decisions without delay."
This gives them time to understand and understand through some of the tests before they write 'man' or 'woman'.
So, you're okay - raise the child, love the child.
You have a beloved child and enjoy it.
We don't need to do any medical treatment in a hurry that can't be returned.
They said, "This [Qur'an] is a decision that takes away children and relieves parents of their difficulties because they do not think that they are doing right."
Finally, the child will determine with which sex she is easier -- and it will be very good.
It enables children to make their own decisions.
A legal wake-up campaign was organised in the middle school group of Ramangar, chairman and all judges of Ramangar, chaired by the Legal Services Committee.
In which students and others were informed of the law for the rights of education and the financial background.
In the camp, Advocate M.E. Hiddena, Rohan's porter, and Sarpach woke up the people who spoke on the subject.
A large number of villagers were present in the program.
Report: Consider the Biden Dumping Obama campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to New York Times, the close advisers of President Barak Obama secretly considered Hillary Clinton’s position as vice president at Biden’s location for ticket 2012.
The most significant threat in the mystery is that Mark Halperin and John Helman, the 2012 campaign Tom, "Double Down: Change Game 2012" expected.
Times received a copy of the future book, and Thursday evening told the president's top advisors what would help Obama to find out if the elections were to be held again in hopes of having to drop.
According to Time’s National Political Communicator Jonathan Martin, the book provides full information on the efforts of the chief officials and puts East White House’s main bill for the name of the former president of the former state to know what the change from the vice president of Clinton affects the pole.
The possible switch was a very safe secret within the basic framework of the Chicago campaign and within the oval office.
Only half the president's close advisor – including the caste, the East Obama campaign chief Jim Massina, and the East White House senior advisors David Axlerod and David Puluffe – were aware of the changes.
"Dual Down" claims that the caste tried to change the beads before finally deciding when their information was being reported would not be corrected in Obama's case by the Clinton ticket.
In a testimony with Martin, Dale confirmed that the government had actually considered the location of Clinton with Biden.
"I said, looking at the whole view, and one of them, it was," she said to the newspaper.
You remember that the president was in danger at the time, and we were in a position like this, "Holy Christ, what else are we going to do?"
While Dredge told the research as "warning", Martin told the CNN's Enderson Cooper that the election campaign again invested importantly in finding how much this claim would benefit from Poland.
"The campaign didn't spend as much money as money and attention on focused groups until they were seriously considering something," Martin told C360.
It's unclear, Halaki, what Obama knew their team was looking for.
Martin told CNN that they had asked him if their boss knew about the possible change?
While Dade said they didn't seem to know about possible changes, the former Chief of Staff believed it was "possible" that Obama knew.
"Double Down" sure: won't answer whether Obama's desk was politically checked and reached? Martin further said.
Cooper asked Martin if they were serious about the Obama Biden dumping ticket investigation.
"Probably," said Martin.
Does Glow-In-Dark Ice Cream Care?
A British author has first used Glo-in-De-Dark Ice Cream-jellifish.
Charlie Francis has benefited greatly from marine animals in order to develop the best damage.
He came to this idea after reading a search letter on Gelipish and Chinese reliable scientists used chemical light to re-light the protein.
This is cream, which will make the protein's PCH level more responsive to the food, and the ice cream will shine.
Chris says ice cream is brighter with a warm reaction to the mouth, i.e. it will be more sharp, the more bright it will be.
Lic I M Delicias Ice cream company's founder Charlie said: "This is an incredible thing, but the production of the early days will get me about 2 grams of stuff from £200."
The protein we're using in ice cream will react with neutral pH in the language.
As soon as the mouth gets warm, the protein will increase the pH and the ice cream will shine.
We've been testing for the past few months and it's looking really good to share it with Halloween because it's giving a wonderful light effect.
It may be the most expensive ice cream that has been made by me because the light of the jellifish is four times more precious than gold
So I have to pay about 140 pounds each.
Even though it's very good.
Charlie's Bristol-based commercial company, beer, cheese, meat and gold card, is famous for its unusual flavor.
But its next design will be even more important.
They said, “I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream.”
It's natural impossible because of the ice crystals that make up the discoloration of ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
This cream is the use of a refractory properties of gelliferous, which has been analyzed by Chinese scientists
The Queen's garden market was full of customers.
It was recently that people had to wait between 15 and 20 minutes to buy cargo.
This is the recent Vazirpur, the extreme wind, the riverpur, the Ashok River Central Market, and the Pacific River in the Central Market.
Some of the same river was found in Pithmpura, Ashok River, and Surrafa shops in Model Town.
The people also bought gold, and silver, and precious stones.
That's why I was drinking in other markets with the outside ring road.
Although it took hours to get home from the office.
Helovin 2013: Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magic.

We will not use anything according to the association of confectioners during Halloween, but it will also remain at about 35 million pounds.
It's about Maca's personal sum of $9 billion.
It's a secret.
There's nothing more than a fussy Halloween ghost house.
They're the best names, "The terror behind the wall (which, in fact, is a prison), "Chikh-o-Chikh" and were like "House of Shock."
In fact, according to the U.S. government, it's a 1,200-officed ghost house in the United States that produces 500 million kings. And it's a terrible picture that puts your friend on Facebook and the man who likes and comments on you.
In the end, talk to the dragon.
Charlie Brown presented the big joke when we were kids, and a Jack-O-Latten map is like decorating a Christmas tree -- that's what we've done since we were little.
For us, from Nosib, there were "Baby In A Pampkin Trade" just started last year because of the Pinterrest, so most of us dug these guards and didn't keep talking to them.

In one field, from 50 feet [50 m] above the ground, a fire - fighting group was called to save a lost doll on the face of a stormy mountain
Cooker Spaniard Ruby fled after arriving on a small street corner
Three days later he was seen trapped in the grave by a dog Walker.
Fireworkers brought down the front part of the rock from scratch to protect the dog from death
After being caught in the face of a terrible mountain by the pope, 50 feet from the ground, he was blessed with a life of fireworkers.
After nine months of cooking Spanish Ruby, Sunday afternoon she ran into a street corner and spent 3 days alone before being rescued from the grave.
His master Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, Denhom, were at the Flypit cave in West Yorkshire to meet him again, and he has congratulated the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After a small accident, they had searched for their lost dog like mad people, and had been posted on social networking sites.
On Wednesday afternoon at 2.15 p.m., a quick-seeing dock Walker saw Ruby, 50 feet high from the ground, in the cave.
From the clickhiton fire station, a technical rescue team arrived at the incident site and used a pet tube to bring it down from the rock to save the ruby.
Technical Defence Officer Andy Clayton said: ‘It was in a bad situation.
He stood in the midst of the rock, above and below, fifty feet.
He did no wrong during the time of his salvation. He was made a stone.
But now he's good.
Then she was eating the biscuit.
It was an unusual call for help.
Nay, but it is a dog's eyes that will not believe.

From Halifax, West Yorkshire, Miss Hall said: "It was terrible to see the healing work."
At first I couldn't believe how she had got there.
It's amazing to get her back in her hands.

The fire department did a lot of good work.
Indeed, what they have done is a thing of great courage.
We are grateful to them, and they were all better.
Mr. Elderson also said, "We were afraid she might fall, but she was standing there."
The fire department did a great job.
I can't believe how he got there.
Mike Jagger says that when Cat was 18, they did not attack him.

Perry said that he had spent time with the senior Rocker, and "When I was 18, they attacked me."
They said, “It is an old thing; and they treat me well.”
A 70-year-old Jagger said in a speech to Thursday that he "does not clearly refuse to attack Katy Parry."
The representative also said, "Maybe Perry is talking about them in someone else's misunderstanding."
Parry was one of the guest singers on the Rolling Stone Tour this year.
Their new album "Prizm" reached the top of the week.
George Keravan: Euro Dementon gave Scotts an option
Another Day, Another Story of Fear of Freedom
This time we have been warned that, as a condition for EU membership, free Scotland will be required to join the whole of Europe as a free travel area.
The port controls on Berwick and the walls of the Adriatic indicate the boundaries of the polar wire.
It is true that Stratclyde Paper described the possible benefits of free access with the rest of Europe, although it was not described in - presumably - headlines.
No one described that the U.S. members spend most of their time changing their official rules according to their needs.
Since Scotland is no longer a shady area, Brussels will be free to continue non-compliance with Brussels instead of getting what it really wants from Scotland.
So, then, A-Kahani.
And the thing that's been trapped for so long has come together. First, I heard about "freedom means passport control" almost 40 years ago.
Yet the interesting old story is gone away.
Why should you expect to build Europe from free Scotland as well?
Why would the London Joke be commercialized for Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real European news: Europe's big, post-war plan has finally stopped.
With the Euro crisis, the project is officially dead in Europe.
Group members are getting strength from U.S.U. to oppose or close Euro as a single currency.
Even in Germany, the Euroscopetil Alternetiv For Germani Party - which has been founded this year - suddenly obtained about 50 million votes in the September's union election, thus effectively expelled the Free Democrats (we are equivalent to our live demos).
The Union's plan to build Europe is always against domesticism.
However, the current economic crisis has proved to be a major variable.
As well as the harsh rules imposed by the Berlin and the European Central Bank, many people are thinking that the project has gone a long way because of the obstacles imposed on national economic systems through the implementation of the same currency.
There was not much role for Euro in the excessive budget loss of national governments - that was only true in the case of Greece.
Instead, the Euro system has set the currency exchange rate for its members on behalf of German exporters - something German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of Home Currency Review, South Europe finds itself in a state of internal loss of production compared to Germany.
The only way is to reduce wages and public goods – promoted by Berlin.
The current budget and currency problems are suffering from deep European production.
The European industry pays four times for electricity and gas in comparison with the United Nations, as a result of the "harvested" energy policies set up by Brussels for the release of French and German energy firms.
It's a plausible cost of damage that we've already seen in Grangemouth.
Even if all wages are frozen in the world, the European Petrochemicals industry cannot save itself from being influenced by US Shell Gas.
As a result, there is a growing sense of rebellion among people, especially in France, who was once the main praiser of the U.S.
After the war, French top politicians saw the E.U. as a way to control Germany, and Paris as a way to provide the world's equivalent billing.
But Berlin now does not need Paris as a passport for political validity, and it has applied its own financial policies to Europe, which is why France's economic system is waning.
Result: The South Pan, U.S. opposition national front, has won a third-place ruling socialist in recent subjugation.
Now France has the most popular group with 24 percent vote -- this is a timely warning for the British lab that they can't assume that the left hand will automatically benefit from the left.
What is Le Pen French dignitaries doing with his newfound fame among the working class?
The group wants to use e.g. the next year's U.S. election in the European Parliament to create the most loyal currency against the U.S.
If, as far as possible, the U.S. opposition groups in these elections are well displayed, this group may for the first time affect the European Parliament.
My view is that the EU will soon put an end to the opposition and the most loyal currency in Europe.
The euro will not be completely exhausted, but it will be broken back in a way that will be supported by the General de Gol, such as "Europe of (Lord) Nations".
Germany and some of its successive economic systems can keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will restart their currencies.
I expect the U.S. will keep itself away from this project in the hope of getting closer with the U.S.S.
However, the increasing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after all?
We can choose to build a small England area (required).
Or we can protect our own financial interests -- which involves telling Berlin and Brussels to separate at the right time.
I think Scotland can do better in the small European system, provided we keep our own money.
It will be easy to work together with other countries of the same mind in non-governmental nations in Europe.
Otherwise, we should think about maintaining our financial freedom as we walk on the road to Norway.
In Scotland, S.N.P. government - markedly - is the most successful anti-government political campaign in Europe, which won an amazing majority in 2011 based on the Tori-Lib Demo Association, proposed by the Chancellor Elistear Darling.
It would be pointless for Scotland to vote for freedom at this time, because in that situation it must be accepted by the laws of civilisation imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Young People — A Time to Grow Up
Research shows that African-American and Spanish girls get younger than young girls when they're young.
Physical changes do not mean that young people are close
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals can be blamed
Experts believe that stability can be one of the causes of anger, depression, and depression.
Young people in pre - Christian times may not be so effective
Former reporters of CNN Pat Etheriz are experts in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if breast development and the birth of the baby begin at the age of 7 or 8?
This week in Orlando, Florida, U.S. Children's Medical Academy, Dr. Paul Caplovitz explained that these initial physical changes are common in American girls, which show new behavior.
Caplovitz says, "I spend a lot of time giving parents this confidence -- that this usually doesn't show rapid progress towards full youth."
It is seen before time in the hair of the eye, and in the eyes of the eyes, and in the eyes of the eyes, and in the eyes of the eyes, and in the eyes of the eyes.
But in the last four decades, there has been a very simple change in the era of religion (first monthly religion).
In the United States, the average age was 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in 1970.
"When the breast begins to develop, at least two or three years appear in the first exercise," says Caplovitz, who is also the author of the "time-to-time youth in girls: the guide needed to deal with this common problem."
The most accurate test of young people's development is time.
Young people argue about what they start, but when they grow up with breast development before 8 years of age, they call it "childhood".
In most cases this process will slow down or stop - which children can monitor closely.
An endocrinologist may need to test for faster progress in order to remove potential problems such as tumors or system serious problems.
Treatments to delay time-pre-munist religion and other outcomes are: premature age-adjustment, which can lead to slow growth and aging.
Drug or hormone treatment depends on the child’s age, development rate, rate of increase, and emotional maturity.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Caplovitz is an Awake! but admits, "Education can increase pressure on young people, and girls may feel different from their peers."
Another major problem is that parents don't just want their underage daughter to have a journalism.
Caplovitz said, "They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will keep it clean."
A woman whose daughter had started her monthly religion at the age of 10 remembers, "It was a shock."
Although there were signs of this and we talked about journalism, she wasn't emotionally prepared.
She was afraid of her school and became troubled that she had started her first monthly religion among her friends.
There are many popular principles about the causes of untimely youth.
However, there is no constant evidence that hormones, chemicals, or media in milk or other food may be charged with minor messages in the environment.
Boys - just like girls - are getting young in time.
Caplovitz determines the rule that its main cause is anger of stability.
She helped to conduct a study on girls between the ages of 6 and 9 in 2001, which combines body weight with youth.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other contributors.
In this country, African-American and Spanish girls tend to get young before their age-old girls.
There's a lot of explanation for this.
At global level, the image of time-early youth, from economic situations to weather and genes, seems influenced by all things.
Other puzzles: Though boys get their faces and knees short of age, the behavior of young men is not as clear as girls.
Other doctors who attended the A.P. convention supported the complexity of the subject.
And it is common even to see children's children, and children's children, both small and great.
“We need to be careful how we identify the real beginnings of young people,” says Dr. Lawrence Silverman at Goreeb Childrance Hospital in Morristown, News.
Parents should not hesitate to take guidance from their child’s physician to talk to their children about this.
Caplovitz advised, "It can be spoken in advance of expected time."
If you stay calm, your child will usually answer correctly.
Pre-former girls need to be assured that even though this is happening before time, it is a normal part of life.
On Friday the temperature was 3.1 degrees Celsius.
And the rain and the cold by night came upon the people: and they knew that they were very cold.
And on the morrow the people went out into the markets, and to their tents.
For the first rain is come out of the earth, and full of rain.
And it came to pass in the morning, that they saw the people enjoying themselves.
As the weather changes, work and sickness will be a source of relief, but then the sun will continue to shine as a cloud for the day.
The children also came to school wearing sweaters.
There, according to the Airfors Weather Division, the maximum temperature was 25.1 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature was 13.7 degrees Celsius.
While 7.8 millimetres of rain has been recorded.
Clouds will continue to be covered in the sky, depending on the weather.
For the width of the seat, on the large orders of the jet manufacturers.
A fight has been waged for two-month battles for long-distance flights for the width of passenger-class seats between airbuilders.
In the flight of long - flying dialogues, economic class seats are centered on the width of the seat of the class, not always as if given by Airlines but whose assigned location has claimed to be the key to the latter jet Erbas SAS and Boeing.
Erbus this week has at least 18-inch (46 cm) wide seats in the Economic Cabin, but it is expected that this will be determined by the Airlines by its main-opposite Boing.
The dialogue came between the aircraft manufacturer when a large version of the associated aircraft was sold from a long distance from the order after a possible 17-21 event.
How is the last section of the plane created? In particular, is the seat 9 or 10 equal to the more capacity claims are being developed, taking into account the design of Mini Jumbo Jets?
Boing says it's built "777 X" which will keep 406 people 17 in width and 10 people in a row in a single section.
Airbus says that by fighting with A350, it will take 350 people to a seat that is 18 inches away.
Often, aircraft diggers are engaged in commercial advertising in commercial press.
Now, with Airbus 777 X, there is hope of attracting more than 100 orders in Dobian Arsos, which is appealing to the public.
Will you accept it at least three times in a restaurant, showing this to the Fencers?
Airbus sales chief John Lehi said "the long flight from Boing Regional Turbo to the intersections"
As a change, people are getting better, but the way to get on doesn't change.
According to data from the U.S. Department of Health, between the 1970 ’ s, when Boing 747 Zimbabwe was not a modern long journey, the average of 40 - 49 years of American male weight grew by 10 percent.
According to US Health Statistics, the average male room is 39.7 in the 21st century.
Airbus said it had a seat with a seat of 1950 when the new name was the average of the "jet set".
Airbus said they have set up a research commission to suggest improvements in the quality of 53 percent sleep in the width of the seat.
Boeing argued on Airbus's seat size statistics, and said that it does not depend on the manufacturer’s decision to hire airlines and make a balance between supplies.
It also says, the research reveals that more than one seat width depends on the experience of Kevin.
Boing Cabin expert Kent Craver said, "It really tells airlines what they need to do to be successful and what they believe they need to do."
"What benefit do they have from not telling us?"
They know their business better than anyone else.
It's about the carbon room for the flyers, but for suppliers it's a quick point that can affect the i.e.
In the decades to come, at least 700 billion dollars of trade behind this debate is sufficient to balance the competition between the US and European exports.
The first time in July that Reuters reported, whether the seat layout is actually the issue of fighting between new jets.
Airbus and Boing claimed that 20 per cent of their new coupled engine design is qualified for the claim, compared with 365-seat Boing 777-300 E.R.
The claim for Boing’s display depends on the comparison of the 10th row of 777 x to the original 9th row of 777 design.
The unit value is now used to compare 10 to the profit.
Kevin Keniston, Europe's Airbus Traveler's head says, "Boing's flying is making more competition with our products and more seats."
On the other hand, analysts say the whole 10-sit-to-one line of kabin for the current 777 S suggests that a number of passengers are on the side of a denser layout, which can go with a slow rent.
Cabin Internal Expert My Carbine, Founder and Editor's Runve Girl Network said "Eighteen-inch seat width will be very good for travellers, but the reality is that this commercial point proposal of Airbus is operated by a threat of 777."
Airbus and Boing do not provide seats but provides a list of providers to choose from for Airlines.
Even the jet vendors around the world are careful to check out this layout competition.
With more ease, all the builders are also providing high-density air services and high-density layout for jet flights.
Aerbus is giving a 10 equal to A350 but they say it's not sold yet.
But recently, Airbus insisted on some of its jets on large cabin seats for more Cabin facilities.
Modern jets are not possible to fly on a new industry standard without the support of another manufacturer, but it can distort 777 X sales.
New anti-Nicotine vaccine may end the joy of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-Nicotine vaccine that can end the fun of smoking.
The same strain of the vaccine, the mice were able to protect themselves from nicotine's bed for life.
Prior to the initiation of human studies, it is necessary to carry out a test, which may take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Well Colonel Medical College in New York said the initial signs are positive.
Professor Cornell said, "We hope that the policies of this kind of vaccine can ultimately help millions of smokers who have tried to quit using all the existing methods in the market today, but they found that their addiction to nicotine is more powerful than these."
The new vaccine has a virus that has been prepared to produce genetic information for the purpose of making anti-Nicotine antibiotics.
This virus, selectively infects the infected cell, which then begins to create a permanent stream of antibiotics.
Antibodies are looking for any nicotine particles in the blood, and preventing nicotine levels from rising within the smoker before reaching the brain.
In the test, the vaccine was given to mice that were later given nicotine, they were doing their normal work.
Researchers say that although the vaccine was not given, it was a sign that Nicotine had reached its brain.
For this use, it was described in the journal Science Translating Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines had failed because they had antibiotics.
It had to feed at regular intervals to maintain the level of the antibiotics, but it proved to be noble and impractical.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be high, because the cell will make the cell a factory of antibodies.
Professor Cristal said that if the human vaccine of the future was completely safe, it could be given to children before they were tempted to smoke, thereby saving them from nicotine.
But it will probably be used to quit smoking by people who smoke.
They said, "They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy smoking because of nicotine vaccine, which can help them break their habit.
British scientists pointed out the results interestingly, but warned of the need to be more researched.
Even after the postpartum, the wall could not rise because of the real death of the garden.
The forest department is naturally reporting the death of the garden as a result of a massive response to this.
On Thursday night, the forest workers of Ramangar van Prog had found a garden that was near the river Rijrev, near the river Rijrev.
All the members of the garden were secure, and there were no wounds or wounds on him.
On Friday, forest-protective conscience pandas, CTR's vice president Sakhat Bodola, DFO Qaksha Nismim, SDA GS Carki's animal doctors were posted by CTR's pet doctors and the Hema of Cotbag's pet was posted at the garden.
According to sources, the interior of the garden is reported to be damaged during the postpartum period.
This did not reveal the real causes of the home’s death.
District officials were responding to the death of the garden.
However, the internal members of the garden have been sent to IVIRI well for topological examinations to confirm the damage.
The Forest Guardian Western Relation Conscience Pande said that the death of the garden can only be said to be natural.
There's no sign of the beginning of the garden.
However, it is being sent to the obscura test to confirm that the area around it is being searched.
Tripods refuse to let us be affected by tripods.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe will be tested by State Corpson Watchdog on Tripody.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripodi's maritime record that the political divide has refused to demand his political master E.D.O.D.O., the defender of East New South Wales, E.O.O., whose government-controlled roles were selfish.
On Friday, the ICAC examined whether Mr. Obied had breached several government ministers' plans for a violation of the laws of the state? Where two Obied-owned restaurants and cafes, after their expiry in August 2005, were refurbished without a tender.
Lin Aspole, the former Chief of Staff, was aware of Mr. Tripody's hidden selfishness of Mr. Obid's testimony after the testimony to Thursday's testimony?
During the 2005 discussions, the government had pressured public tenders to be launched for panels.
The barbers were against it, and they wanted more time.
In 2009, the company of the band, which won Obied for 2.5 million dollars a year, was renovated without the band's tender.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as the Minister of Departments from February 2006 to November 2009, was at the start of the public tender.
But they refused to change Mr. Obide's request, Mr. Tripodi called for a change in government policy.
In a phone call presentation at the ICAC in August and September 2007, Mr. Obied and Mr. Tripod and Steve Dan, a senior official who came to the headquarters of Mr. Obied after serving in the port ministry
Assistant-led Anthony Whey asked Mr. Tripodi. "Was the discussion on the development of commercial policy in the telephone conversation?"
"No," Mr. Tripod answered.
I couldn't remember what the discussion was, but it wasn't definitely.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obid.
Officials say that Israeli warplanes ran to Syria.
The Israeli warplanes set the goal of the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior administrative officer confirmed the Fox News.
The official did not explain the purpose, but there was at least one purpose required.
The report of the Associated Press reports that the target was the Russian missile ASA 125.
Israel has struck missiles in Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign workers can pass "authenticity" tests on 457 visas
The government is considering a "authenticity" test for foreign workers on 457 Vja, because it aims to expand a harsh operation.
If accepted, this test will be carried out by means of a warrant designed to prevent 457 family members and friends who are used to fill or dispose of professional positions in Australia.
Today, a government discussion letter was issued, denouncing the government's previous Laber M.P. Maxin McCu today said it could anger the neighbouring countries of Australia.
Today, he told the U.S. India Institute that "foreigners are reaching the end of Qatar" and that "Australian people are working before" is a very bad time, while the Union has been demanding a safe labour market."
Historically, the reason was that white workers should be protected -- and if some people in the area had seen the echo of that historical witness, I would not be surprised.
The discussion paper shows a framework of 12 measures previously considered by former Minister Chris Bowen.
Minister Brendan O'Conner, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met with officials on the subject, has activated five institutional changes, while the rest have been questioned.
If the "authenticity" rule is adopted, the verification of the visa applicant may be made as to whether "the name is true in circumstances where the person named is a relative or personal partner of the owner or of the consenting person of the person designating the visa".
Employers may need to count the number of 457 power holders, because the first entrepreneurs who wanted to organize fewer workers hired hundreds of people.
During this time, 35-year-old Sri Lankan refugees died of a similar heart attack on Christmas Island this week.
Now his nine-year-old son was with him in the way, and his father's brother with him in the day of his death, and his mother's brother with him, and his mother's brother with him, covered him.
Australian authorities have brought the person to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The British government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project in Scotland.
The work by HS2 indicates high-speed services in the northern part of Scotland and England, which will soon begin with the first step in 2026.
Transport Minister Baronez Kremer said the project would be "British one."
Scotland's Transport Minister Keith Brown said they are very "encouraged" by working with the British government on the project.
New high-speed rail lines will be included between London and West Midlands in the first step.
When the second step is complete, the lines reach Manchester and the lead.
In June, the government revised the cost of building a high-speed link between London and Northern England to £32.7 billion and revised it to £42.6 billion.
The British government, which was talking to Scotland's transport, directed HS2 to consider the capacity and time of the train for Northern England and Scotland, and the possibilities for better development.
This includes the possibility of three hours or less of possible travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Byrones Kremer says: "Our goal for HS2 is a real national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together."
We're moving forward with HS2, because it'll be much more profitable.
Without it, we will face problems related to the capacity of our network.
But it's also about the connectivity of 18 cities in Britain, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be better connected due to HS2.
According to Scottish Secretary-General Elystairs Carmiquell: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr. Carminekl's "clear" return to Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "Scotland is likely to benefit heavily from high-speed rails, but this will also increase the financial burden on Scotland in the whole of Britain.
Therefore, we are encouraged to work in the British government's participation so that we can explore options to bring high speed rails in Scotland, generate benefits for all and complete the Glasgow-Edinburg line, which the Scottish government is already planning.
I'm ready to review the review report with British government ministers next year and decide on future action together.
Air - power regulations will be effective now in Australia
Despite the gentle steps taken in device management in the US, Australian air passengers should continue to stop their tablets and smartphones when they fly and land.
The U.S. Aviation Administration has left the option to change its operations to enable US airlines to read, watch videos or play games on their devices during important flight steps, provided that they remain in the "Air" mode.
Travelers can still do so during many flights, but many people don't like to be able to fly and get to their e-book at the beginning.
Australian air service companies are considering this decision, according to which US air service companies will have much more work to do to meet this need, but they have indicated that they do not have an immediate plan to change their processes.
The Civil Aviation Security Authority also said that it is considering the announcement, but insisted that the ban on the use of electrical devices is still effective in important flight steps in Australia.
"In the current case, CASA does not have a specific arrangement to control the use of electrical appliances in the air," the authority said, "this is a matter of regulations, according to which air service management companies must ensure that the security system has always been fully established, and that passengers must comply with the security instructions given by the members of the driver's team."
Virginia, who is already talking to CASA about expanding her in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but she asked to act on the manager's instructions.
The speaker said, "We will welcome a review by CASA in the case of the use of electrical devices, because we really think it will give customers a better experience, because now we have wireless inflatable entertainment on our planes.
Quantus said it would now comply with the current rules.
He said, "We can't use electrical devices when we fly and fly, and we don't have an immediate plan to change it."
FAA decisions apply to U.S. allergens.
Thus, we are always interested in dynamic developments that can benefit travellers and we will certainly consider the reasons for the FAA's decisions and its consequences.
The impact of this decision will be different on each US air service company and will depend on their flight time.
Air service companies will need to verify that their flights can withstand radio operation with their mobile devices, as well as to investigate their rules of books, training materials, car-on-bagage programs and short details for travellers.
The FAA said that "After the airline's approval of their airworthiness, it will allow passengers to use light-weight electric devices such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones on all altitudes."
In non-visibility cases, the pilot team will instruct passengers to stop their equipment when they land.
The group has also suggested that heavy equipment should be safely placed under the seat or in the upper boxes during loading and landing.
The money of the Panbrokers because of the difficulty of the middle class in Singapore
In Singapore, at the Bendemier Shopping Center in Ponshop, Janny Amirthlinga is taking her daughter's money to pay for her school face.
She said: "My husband and I have recently bought a house, and all our money has been spent in it."
They say that although they earn 3,000 Singapore dollars as administrators (U.S. dollars), and their husbands also work, the family's monthly income is insufficient.
In fact, in parts of South-East Asia, such demand - where domestic debt is growing - became the third largest stock exchange in Singapore this week.
It's not the only way to get credit for the fall of the spell - in the case of Mrs. Amirthlinga, 1,300 Singapore dollars - but almost unsecured bank loon as easy as possible.
In Singapore, Ponbroker usually takes 17 per cent a year, which is slightly higher than 15.4 per cent of the United Surveillance Bank, which is a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, Ponbrokers has the benefit of not requiring a credit check or a paycheck, and they can make loans faster than the bank.
In this area, millions of people are struggling with ponshops because of the increasing cost of family living and household and consumer debt.
For five years after the global financial crisis, strong growth, and simple modern economic policies, the low and medium-sized families have been taking stock of their needs, following a slow credit crisis.
This week's rating agency, Standards Ange Powers, told the growing domestic profits due to the growing bond (mortgage) of the Asian banks' debt monitoring factors.
He said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt in Asia and Singapore.
With 80 percent of Malaysian GDP, it is on the top of the list, while 60 percent in 2008.
In Thailand, economists are concerned about the high levels of consumer debt, which this week is mildly affected by the technical crisis.
On Thursday, the data has been shown to be low in export demand and consumer demand.
The Malaysian Bank, C.I.M.B., economist Song Sing Woon, said, "The determining point is that with increasing prices, people coming into the lower middle class will try to increase their income in every way possible."
In the last two years, the values of gold have historically high values moved people to hold personal property down, because they are taking advantage of the opportunity to build up the values of their families.
In Singapore, 70 per cent of the city-state's items are gold.
People are saying, "The feeling of gold is good, let's keep my grandmother's gold chain down, and bring it back the next month.
Thailand's largest ponshop manager, Ejimney, has seen a 20 per cent increase in the number of customers using their outlets in recent months.
There is such an increase in the fallout business that the executives of Volumex and Singapore in Bendemir and 15 others, not only in their neighbours, are planning to expand in Malaysia where there are four shops, but also plans to expand outside Asia, says Volumex's executive director Jah Le Ching.
The company will use 60 per cent of Singapore's $66 million in this week's listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discount landers (the lender) have been criticized for high interest rates, Ms. Jaha says that falling down is not only a constant rate compared with other borrowers, but it does not increase the apparent debt.
They say, "Customers keep things that they already have, and do not increase building up personal property in domestic debt.
Social support for short-term and secure financial assistance is increasing.
It's not that the Ponchbrokers only use financially weak people.
In Singapore, rich people also use Volumex's outlets, keeping gold bars or Rolex events down to 60 percent of their purchases.
We have customers from all classes of society.
Sister Jaha says, "It includes rich people who need to borrow for a little while for business or investment, or small businesses who need to meet their cash flow needs."
Sometimes they only need money in a very short time.

325 million-dollar security package for Tagi's health
The United Nations government has stressed that there are also harsh conditions associated with the 325 million-dollar security package to ensure that the government can't destroy the regime.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the National Assembly, the island's older population, the high rate of germinal diseases, and the system's limits are "early acting to address the current crisis".
The decision to feed for four years was made after a government consultation with the free spirit Andru Wilki of Tunisia.
Sr. Pleibersec said today, "The government has brought the early rescue package, which we believe will solve the special challenges facing the government.
The $325 million package also includes an alternative surgery plan for 31 million dollars.

But the Allied Bird Health Speaker Peter Duton believes today's announcement is "The Band-Ad Solution."
He said to ABC TV, "We're here because the Liberian state government has taken $430 million in its health system.

The monitoring group said Syria has destroyed its ability to make chemical weapons
The Monitoring Group told Thursday that Syria has destroyed important instruments to build chemical weapons and greenhouse gas war materials, while there has been a heated conflict in the northern part of Syria, which is very close to the place where poison agents are held.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian Movement Group said that nearly three years ago, about 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the war in Syria.
This announcement by the chemical weapons organization was dated November 1st, one day before the end of the day
The Hague-based organization has decided to destroy all chemical weapons production units and toxic gases and the machinery used to fill in war content or to "make ineffective".
The primary goal of the initial phase of destruction is to destroy all chemical weapons in Damascus by the middle of 2014.
The destruction of the device means that Syria can no longer create new chemical weapons.
Although, Damascus still has to destroy existing weapons and collections.
Syria is now believed to have 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including masturbating gas and Norwegian agents Serin.
The British situation of the Syrian observatory for Human Rights has reported that this announcement occurred when Thursday had an increase in the battle in Sapphira, which experts believe is a chemical weapon production unit and a storage center.
In Syria, a group that describes the number of deaths through the Net of Movement in Syria told Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
He said that 6,365 children, including 61,067 ordinary citizens, are included.
The government has said that 29,954 President Bashar is a member of the military army of Assad, 18,678 fighters on the government's side, and 187 Lebanese Hizbullah activists.
He also said that there are 2,202 soldiers in the dead, and about 5,375 birds, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated that nearly 100,000 people have died in the war since March 2011.
This has not updated the data since then.
This struggle has forced some 20 million people to leave the country.
The army of the Asshurites fought against the rebels in Sephera for weeks; and many of the people were of the noncombatant.
The obstetrician told the obstetrician that people have been murdered on both sides, but clearly did not say anything.
This war represents the threat faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who have a mission to end toxic weapons in Syria during the war during a very short period of time.
According to the U.S.O.C.W., who worked with the United Nations, it is said that its team is "now satisfied and has confirmed - and has seen all of Syria's declared important production and mixing/filling devices - destroyed."
He also said, "No monitoring plan has been made any more."
At the beginning of this week, observers said that they had completed the first step of the confirmatory work on 21 of the 23 centres announced by Damascus.
Observers said they were unable to go to two centres for security reasons.
On Friday, O.P.D.L. said that, according to Syria, these two centres "have been abandoned and... the chemical weapons products stored there have been brought to other declared centres, which have been monitored."
It was not immediately clear that the unit in Sephera had one of the two centers, where O.P.C.D. could not be visited.
Syria has put forward a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the O.P.C.B.'s working committee next month.
H.U.U.U.U.U.U., director of the group, which has continued to comment, said, "I welcome the strength and encouragement you have shown in carrying out the most challenging mission that this organization has ever carried out."
For three years this house has been in the midst of the war mainly by the government of the peace and its security forces, including members of the Alawite sect from Shia Islam, and there is a conflict between the rebels among the Sunny Muslims.
In another series of events, the chief Rami Abdurrhaman of the absorbitter said that Syria's coastal territory in Latvia had been severely detonated in the Air Defense Centre on Wednesday.
He said that the cause of this explosion is not yet known.
The police have taken copies of net registers, net stamps, laptops and net registers from prosecutors.
The Morty City Police have filed a case against all the defendants.
Police Commissioner Promegat Lione Gile said that in the arrest charges, Habowald, the city's political front of the moon, the circle of the circle of the moon, the valley of the moon, the mountains of the mountains, and the mountains of the mountains, included the golden ring of the moon.
The registry's office (formerly) has been run away by a blbber lion.
According to the police, the prosecutors charged the registry office with the Clark and the record-keeper blbber lion taking out papers from the records of empty and old lands and then buying new stamps and making net registers on them.
This was not the result of the loss of the original registry.
And they sold the land for millions of pieces of money, after they had made an accusation against the people of the land.
There, they took Lonon on the paper.
After that, the real owner of the land was under pressure from the police and the administration.
The network registers had a special focus on the NRAI lands.
Because there is no guardian of the NRAIG land.
So it's easy to sell the land's network registers.
Police Commissioner Gil reported that the prosecutors have questioned whether they have already prepared network records near 150.
According to the police, Sargana's group is already involved in fraud and theft against the politician.
Crying at the court of the bomb bomber in Bali
In 2002, 202 families and relatives of the bombers who were killed in the attack complained about the bomb planner's conviction that the age panel should face the fire team.
The panel, which has been running away as one of the most wanted in Southeast Asia for nearly 10 years, has been sent to a 20-year sentence to build the explosive device used in the bombing.
He can be released within 15 years of being given the password.
At 45 years of age, the killing of 202 people, including 88 Australians, was committed by two night clubs in Kuta's famous travel area, and many were injured.
He was found guilty of many other charges of terrorism, including a series of bombings in Indonesia during the early night of Christmas in 2000.
The planners had demanded the sentence of Adivan Karava, although they could also demand that the death penalty be the cursed "destructor" of the person called the bomber.
This decision renewed the painful memories of June Cortin, who lost their 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack by Paktec and his co-introverts a decade ago.
In order to stop his ass, he said that Pakque should have been sentenced to death.
I really feel that he should have been punished just like other great terrorists.
Ms. Cortin said to A.P., "He should be standing in front of the firing squad."
I live every day without my relatives, and without my daughters.
On October 12, 2002, just after 11am, The Club was removed after the explosion of the bomb that was loaded into the van outside the club.
Peter Hughes, a bagpack filled with explosives by self-inflicted attackers, was at the pedge bar 20 seconds before the explosion.
As a result of the bombing, they went into a long coma for a month and were "dead" three times while living on life-saving devices.
Mr. Hughes said that Pakque should have received the same sentence as three other members of the Islamic terrorist group - Amoroji, Mahals, and Imaam Sea - who had been sentenced to death four years earlier.
Actually, this person has to be executed before anyone else dies.
To keep him alive, look! He has no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and wounding countless people, 20 years of punishment is not enough.
Peck, the last person to get the punishment from the Bali bomb blasts.
He survived arrest for nearly a decade, but finally, in January 2011, he was arrested in the coup d'état of Pakistan, where the U.S. Army had recently killed Osama bin Laden in less than four months.
During the trial, F.B.I.A. presented evidence that the report found that Pakque was in Pakistan in an attempt to re-establish contact between South-East Asian terrorist groups and illegal contacts with Bill Laden.
Sister Cortin says, "He didn't dedicate himself."
Even today, he's not really suffering so many people from mental distress.
This decision came before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be marked by celebrations in Bali and Australia.
Mrs. Cortin said, "This year there will be a lot of tears."
Pakek can still appeal against his sentence.
F.A.: Air travel can now use a widget in the air (but can't call a cell phone)
From entering the air passenger gate, they will be able to read, work, play games, watch moving, listen to music, use their electronic devices - but they won't be able to talk to their phones - such a teacher is still required by the U.S. Air Force.
But passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
At a news conference, F.A.'s administrator Michael Huarta said that the speed with which these changes are implemented would be different in each airline.
Airlines will need to show F.A. how their flights, new directions, and how to update the rules for their drivers' training books and to collect devices to show directions.
F.A. said it's already got plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on the plane.
Delta and Zetblu are among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
In a statement, the F.A. said, "Based on the state of the plan, we can very quickly accept the extended use of the electronic device.
At the moment, passengers need to shut down their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the airport is closed.
They are expected not to set them up until they reach the altitude of 10,000 feet of the plane and are permitted by the captain.
Passengers are expected to stop their device again when they land on the plane, and do not start until the plane is fully down.
F.A. said that within new directions, airlines that are fully secure from electronic equipment could allow their passengers to fly by air, when they land, and when they were taxiing.
Most new airlines and other aircraft that have been audited so that travellers can use more wire at altitude are expected to meet these standards.
The president of the Association of Professional Flight Attenant, Laura Glading, has welcomed these changes.
Glading said in a statement, "When policy is safely implemented -- and we will work together with airlines to do so -- it will be a win-win thing for both sides."
When it comes to this issue, we've been warm to feel like Hall Monitors.
The Agency said, however, that it would still be prohibited to connect to the Internet at a height of less than 10,000 feet, to send-mail, to send or receive messages, or to download data.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So there's still no conversation with friends, such as online Scrabble, with a famous event related to the fact that in 2011 Akter Elek Baldwin was playing on their smartphone while staying at the airport, and the U.S. Airlines had dropped them off when they refused to stop the device.
And like heavy equipment, laptops must still be collected at the beginning because they'll be worried about hurting the other person in the cabin.
Phones will continue to be banned during the flight.
The virtual authority associated with a phone call is attached to the communication mechanism, not F.A.
F.A. may remove some restrictions on some electronic devices while flying and dropping.
Last month, Mark Roženken of the National Transport Security Council, who is a national transport security specialist in C.B.S. News, said that cell phones are still considered dangerous.
Roženkar said, "The cell phone is really serious, not only because they can possibly generate traffic on the navigation device, but also because they can produce traffic on the cell phone towers when they're in the air.
The World Advisory Committee established by F.A. to examine this issue has established last month that the government should allow more use of personal electronic devices.
Pressing F.A. to reduce usage of these restrictions is increasing pressure in recent years.
St. Claire McSchilk, a reviewer like D-Mo, said there's no valid reason for security for the ban.
These restrictions are becoming more difficult because the use of the device is widespread.
Some studies have also shown that about three thirds of passengers forget or ignore orders to stop their device.
F.A. began to ban the use of electronic devices by travellers in 1996, when passengers had received reports of interference with F.M. Radio and high-tech gadgets from navigation and communication devices.
New Airlines companies are more dependent on the electrical system than the last generation of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved to resist electronic intervention by F.A.
Airlines have been offering the use of wi-fi at cruising altitude for years.
The revised flights for the Wi-Fi system are also more resistant to traffic.
Huarta said that most airlines should be able to meet the requirements for more use of the electronic device within the new direction.
Today’s electronic devices emit very few radio transmissions of power compared to the last generation.
For example, e-readers transmit the complete namespace when the page is flipped.
However, the transmission is effective when downloading or uploading data from the device.
Amazon.com is also being used by travellers to reduce restrictions on the use of devices.
In 2011, the company's officials loaded their full-scale e-readers in Airlines and flew them to the trouble test, but no such problem was found.
The F.A. Advisory Committee has expressed mixed feelings about the risks of using the device.
The National Aviation Traveler Association's Douglas Kid said they believe that the device is real, even if it's dangerous.
Other members of the committee said that only the reports described by pilots, most of whom are very old, are in support of device deployment in the aircraft system.
However, members of the committee arranged to allow F.A. pilots to order passengers to stop the device when they were low in visibility.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes, and they say they are the common knowledge facilities for people travelling during the recent period of industry.
Roger Doe, of the U.S. Travel Association, said we are pleased that the F.S.A. recognizes that traveling with joy is not incompatible with security, security and security.
Learning from the Silsilwevar bombings in Panda, the U.S. police have been able to provide a room for a response to the incident during the incident and during the early hours of the incident.
In order to ensure the smooth implementation of the Tatayat regime, the banning of gangs of riots, the teaching of riots, and the arrest of other gangs of those who resulted in the arrest of all 1,800 main cities in the military city, wholesale markets and other places, along with vehicles and pedestrian patrolling.
These young people will include women police officers with PCR, traffic unit.
City hotels, guest houses and other places with PGI will also check the records with police personnel and commands alert.
Thana SCHO has been instructed to organize a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate cases.
In addition, DSP has been assigned to investigate markets, malls and other locations, including the city's VIP sectors.
The high-ranking authorities in the early days of the celebration of the situation and the demons have also determined the duties of additional police officers in the police control of the people's welfare.
The police were asked to hold high-ranking in early hours with the Director, Chief Director and DHS of the Press Department and the PGI, as well as with the GMS and 32 GMS administration.
Branch officials have now put the name 'Anti-Gunda Staff' on duty, along with women's police officers, under the leadership of Ngio.

All SCHOs are ordered to put 44 ninjas in the inner areas of the city on the screen.
Police workers will also be established at 38 Naka points on the city's borders.
The bird was left in the woods by air transport to protect from the North Sea.
The bird found on the North Sea Oil Ridge has been abandoned by air transport from the shore back into the forest.
Before returning to their Eloa-based rescue centre, Eberdin sent a helicopter to rescue the bird called the Vajar Rail.
"It was probably a winter passenger bird in northern Europe, which came in the heat of the strong winds on the North Sea," said Central Manager Collins Seden.
It seems the bird was tired and he took refuge on the Oil Ridge.
They said, "It was impossible to fly again, so we were contacted for help."
Before he left, the district railway had recovered and recovered.
Is the European High School ready to engage in business with Britain?
In April, business for Britain was launched and business brought together, and it was promised that U.K.'s business and wealth makers wanted to see changes in our relationship with the U.S.
For this we asked them what they thought of the business of Britain with the U.S., by organizing the largest and most extensive surveys of British professional leaders.
U-Gov has been a representative of Britain's commercial size, areas and places for 1,000 business leaders.
The conclusions of this survey can be surprising for many people.
We found that a large part of business wants to export out of Europe now, and wants to focus on countries that are becoming modern and growing, while the EU member states are not moving.
They want the government to give priority to new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than to be involved in the long-term and bad process of reforming the U.S. mysterious institutions.
When one authority asked them about specific policy areas such as the product law, most business leaders believed that these crucial skills should be controlled back to Westminster.
A single market could easily be seen of general dissatisfaction, businessmen say that the cost of Brussels's administration is far more than the profits of becoming part of Europe's commercial field -- even the vast businesses that traditionally were part of European companies, 40 per cent of them agreed on.
In the end and most clearly, our survey of professional leaders found that, a large part clearly wants Britain, the United States, to move forward on the path of trade-based relations and union change rather than politics.
This conclusion, which was seen in the levels of the main business groups, showed that businessmen are pushing towards a "material change", which will give the US back its lost power.
This is a very high price - the issue of a better deal for Britain did not change 16 per cent in the non-collection of the United States.
The prime minister should have no doubt about it: this survey indicates that British businessmen, U.S.A., support their plan to talk about British membership conditions.
It also showed that businessmen expect to resume a useful change to balance the current power on behalf of the U.K.
A better deal for British businesses is possible, and it is becoming necessary very quickly, because Eurozone is moving forward towards a unified economic system and a capital union.
Priority should certainly be given to jobs and growth in Britain, as the conclusions of our survey show that business means a new focus on trade and fundamental changes in the management of Brussels.
Alexis Miler of Gazprom described the pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new cycle
The beginning of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria has marked the start of Europe's largest energy projects.
"Today a historic event has taken place: the construction of the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, which is the largest and most important project in Europe." Alexi Milar, President of Gazprom, told the teacher in a statement.
The project is a major element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream will diversify Russia's export routes in Europe.
The authorities said that Ukraine, where most of Russia's gas for Europe is part of, presents a dangerous dialogue for traditional ways between the Gaza Strip and the Gaza Strip.
Miler said a member of the European Union means a direct connection to Bulgaria, ending the twin geo-republic risks associated with the countries of transition.
After the start of the entire project in 2015, Bulgarian customers will receive gas at rates that will be released from the South Stream.
Gazprom said that construction should begin in other lowstream countries by the end of the year.
This pipeline is designed for the annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Prior to the charges against the Lord Jonathan W.M.S.A., the Royal Commission heard a charge against two female workers of the Y.M.A.
In 2011 before the charge against Jonathan Lord, the caretaker of the Child Caretaker Child in 2011 has been charged with the crimes of the two employees of the Child Gender Crimes in W.M.A.N.S.D.
But in his statement to Ajum, he said, "It has never been the case of Baal Jonah's persecution within his organization," said Ajum.
The chief official was asked by Philip Herre about the case in which a child pornography crime was charged with an employee of the Y.M.A., and another case in which the Y.M.C. Caringbah was charged with child crime against children who were in charge of him in 1991.
Mr. Hare, the president of the relief department, said they knew about the first case, but they didn't know about the second case.
They also admitted that the saying "Way.M.S.A. has been tested externally and that they have found Yay.M.S.A. to be the best way to protect the child" is not true.
The evidence is that W.M.A. was notified, and this year received a second lowest rating in the Education and Community Quality Audit in August of the year.
Mr. Green, who has been associated with W.M.A. since the 21st century, admitted that the Lord's appointment has failed the administration of "self with me", and failed to ensure that the workers were clearly aware of their duties regarding reporting child protection policies violations.
At the beginning of this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences with 12 children during the two-year term of office in W.M.C.
He was sentenced to at least six years in Karab.
But Mr. Greene refused to suggest that there was a cultural problem in W.M.S., which caused workers not to report a child protection violation by the Lord.
Workers gave the witnesses what they saw about the violation, where they spent time alone with the Lord with the children, made them sit alone, put them in good shape, said that he loved them, and allowed them to play on his mobile phone.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under Lord's supervision, and he said to train children, because he was concerned about his behavior, testified that the Lord's supervisor Wai.M.C.B. was "hard to find a very threatening and most time" by Jackie Bernard, the managing director of the Child Service at Keringbah.
C.E.O. said that he did not accept the witness of the workers that they were not easy to inform their manager.
He said that, but their friend with Lord had misled their decision to inform him about it.
Mr. Hare said he had given his opinion to the N.S.B. Assembly that the text for the "Johnathan Lord's Event" organization was "not to give notice".
Mr. Harree said that shortly after the prosecution came, the decision to sign the secrecy agreement was made by the High Commissioner for Child Services Liam Whitele.
He said that his purpose was to avoid interference with the witness, but it was not "excessive" and executed properly.
Professor Stephen Smallbon of the Griffith University's Bal Jon Exploitation said that during the period between 2099 and 2011, Jonathan Lord was not a safe organization.
He said that the appointment, training, access, training and monitoring of workers were "serious problems".
The hearing is suspended until December 20.
Blair says they want Britain back.
Tony Blair said they'd want the opportunity to be British prime minister again -- but they believe there's no possibility of a return.
In his testimony at night at the fifth anniversary of his education from the prime minister's office, 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various home policies.
After a decade as a leader, after leaving office in June 2007, Mr. Blair refrained from discussing British politics to a considerable extent, limiting the role of representatives of the Middle East peacemakers.
When asked whether they would like to return to the prime minister's office, Mr. Blair was presented by the London's Evening Standard newspaper saying, "Yes, yes, but it's not possible, so..."
They urged the leaders not to ignore the commercial community after a financial crisis.
When a group of horse-showers gathered in Cardiff for the best horse-shower of the year, they knew that this would be a challenging competition.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
They have not even gone to school yet, and a few months from taking their first step, this little child and his Palatine Shetland's Tutou Tafi easily completed three steps and won the top prize - he left his 30-year-old opponents behind.
In the annual competition organised by the Sunny Equestrian Center in the near rudri of Cardiff, a couple who could not be separated - which is Sk's length - were highly praised for their display, behavior and style.
In front of men and women wearing beautiful baller hats, he rubbed his flat hat at the back of the corner and turned his two-year-old toffee into a ring.
Judges praised Fenton for his natural ability to control, which is much older than his age.
And Tofi got the highest score for his appearance and personality.
Fenton was given the gift on his third birthday as a gift last March, and he has studied with this day-to-day Shetland forest.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, "Fonton and Toffy are a great couple."
They had to face all expectations, but they both won gold cup and rosette.
It was only the second time that he was in a competition with Tofi, and we are all very happy with his victory.
The most different in this color area, he seemed so wonderful to everyone that they wanted to take pictures with him.
This little child of Nantiglo village near Ebwell, South Wales, is following the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for more than 10 years.
Mr. Howels said, "The whole place was filled with excitement, and everyone was laughing and playing."
He was running to and fro in all the field. He did wonderfully, even though he was so small.
Fonton is a monster -- he loves horses, tractors and fields, and he's got two cows he cares for.
The way he started, he's going to be showing the greatest horse of the year a long time ago -- and I trust he'll do a very good show.
The speaker for the annual horse show said: "Fonton's age is only three years, but he has to control his own dick."
They're very good couples.
The decision-makers scored, Fenton and Toffy's way of showing and their presentation in the show ring.
They saw good team work between the bush and its riders - they were the best in the Fonton and Toffy ring in this case.
I fully believe that Fentan's love clothes helped him, he was really looking very different.
The Chinese newspaper that argues is going to be the "aggravator"
A Chinese newspaper, which had an appeal on the front page to leave the defendant Manhani, will be sued, said a press judge.
The New Express newspaper of Guangjo gave a massive public argument for the release of journalist Chen Yongjo.
But after that, Mr. Chen admitted on television that he had agreed to write a report on the state-owned part-time company.
Vinyamk said that the new expression now has to be "completely corrected".
The order for "repair" came from the Guangdong Press and publications, radio, film and television administration.
"A preliminary review showed that the New Expression of the Young Evening News Group had been printed in many false news about the Listed company’s Jumplion since mid-August 2012.
Vinyamk said in a statement that "the editorial management of the new expression was unregulated."
He said he had decided to impose an administrative penalty "by cancelling the license of the Chen Hong Kong reporter."
It " instructed the Young Evening News Group to improve a complete new expression, to provide an immediate review of those responsible for it in the new expression and to review the leadership of the new expression."
Mr. Chen wrote in many articles in the New Expressions that condemn financial irregularities in a construction-up company called Jumullion.
After they were released, their newspaper published two pages of appeal for their release, and said that it supports Mr. Chen's journalism.
But then Mr. Chen agreed to write and publish false stories for government television.
He told C.T.V. the government broadcaster, "In this case, I have damaged Jumullion as well as the entire media industry and the ability to win people's trust."
I did this mainly because I had a desire for money and fame.
I've felt my mistakes.

Self-propelled railways found in the U.S.-Mexico Drugs mines
One of the most complex drug-related mines between the U.S. and Mexico has been found, including its own lighting, ventilation and electrical rail system.
U.S. officials have described four-foot features as one of the most complex hidden ways to search for three-foot mines.
The mine is about six feet long, which connects Tijuana, close to Mexico, and San Diego, U.S.A.
This area is filled with one of the same mushrooms, which makes it easy to hide a drug-filled truck.
The authorities said it was closed before a drug went through the mines.
According to the court's archives, the authorities have seized half eight tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine, in connection with mine search.
Three persons, about whom the authorities said they were operating as drivers, were charged with having Marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute.
If they are convicted, they may be sentenced to 10 years from Karav, from Karav, to Avivan Karav.

British police sent Anja a confession note
The British Police sent a return note today to the founder of Wikilex, Julian Asji, who has taken refuge in the Ecuadoran embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said he sent 40-year-old Australian Assize a "dedication note" for which they would have to attend the police station, and said they would be responsible for arresting themselves if they failed to do so.
In fact, sexual crimes are facing a lawsuit in Sweden, as well as their options under British law ended when the Supreme Court rejected their appeal against the verdict at the beginning of this month.
Stockhom would bring them back to the U.S., with fear they had asked for asylum in the Ecuadoran embassy in London on June 19th.
One speaker said that Scotland Yard sent "40-year-old Assize a self-dedication note for which they needed to attend the police station on the date and time they were chosen by us."
They're in violation of the terms of their authority.
The ambassador refused to comment on the police note.
Astja is afraid that more than 250,000 U.S. encryption-opposing websites on Wiklix will be represented by the United States to deal with possible terrorist charges.

Foreign property owners will end London’s artistic situation
The Finance Department has traditionally counted CGT measures, but is waiting for Mr. Osborn's final decision, which presented a 7 per cent stamp duty in the 2012 budget of more than 2 million pounds, and a person who prefers to live in a company instead of a separate person.
In 2012/13, Stamp DUT 708 million pounds, which is already more than the combined sum of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and the North East, North West and Yorkshire and Hamber, remained in the cities of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea.
Mr. Cooke said: "After the presentation of an increase in the stamp of high-valued houses and the Associated Anti-Evadens statement, it is very difficult to argue that there is the least appropriate tax on the high-value property, which has nothing to do with the influence of the system since it was old.
They added that "but this step could make it difficult to sell to some foreign investors in London and to sell to current owners."
According to estimates in rich South-West London, the top 5 to 10 per cent of the home market, which is spread from Fulham to Wumbledon, has increased 11.8 per cent last year.
According to Seville's research, the rate of annual growth of 5.6 per cent in the values of Central London continued to increase annually, but the increase in the market was slightly lower, as the city's south-west, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent).
Scientists have also shed light on the relationship between the dog's tail and its mouth.
Previous research has found that happy dogs move their tail more to the right (from the dog's eyes), while unscathed dogs move their tail mainly to the left.
But now scientists say that partner dogs can recognize this tiny secret and express their reaction to it.
This study has been published in Journal News Biology.
Professor Georgia Wellertigara from the University of Trento said: "All people know that the left and right parts of the brain are involved in different ways in the stimulation that produces positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to see it among other nations.
They told him that the right side of the dog was also responsible for his left hand's actions and vices, and that two of the oxen played a different role in the emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the movement of each other through other dogs, researchers watched animals in other dogs' films.
They measured the heart rate of the pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
We probably won't take more time to understand why their mood sometimes moves on one side.
Prof. Wellertigara said: "We presented dogs with dog movies - in a shadow-shaped version or other points of confusion, and we could see the cat's movement and present the cat more to the left or to the right."
And it came to pass, when the beasts saw the dog, that they moved upon their backs: and they were at rest.
But when they saw him turning his back, they turned aside mainly to the left (from the dog's sight), and their hearts became troubled, and they were troubled.
According to Professor Wellertigar, they don't think dogs were consciously communicating with each other through these incidents.
Instead, they feel that dogs have learned from their experience about what to worry about and not about.
They said: If you have been given a portion of other dogs, and if they keep moving about with one another, then (know that) this is better for you in respect of the affair and in respect of the affair on the right hand, then you will most certainly react on the basis of an experience.
Researchers say that these conclusions can provide better information about animal feelings to owners, veterinarians and trainers.
Professor John Bradshaw of the University of Bristol, guest of the School of Weather Science, explained that it is not the first study to examine whether the dog is important to the left or the right.
Last year, the University of Linkon team found that when dogs see an aggressive dog, they turn their heads to the left and turn their heads to the right when they see a happy dog.
In another research by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "In contrast to the Italian study - when the robot was moved to the right-hand side, it was more likely that the dogs would get closer to him than the rest of the dog."
He said that this was because in various studies dogs did not fully understand animals or robots in movies.
He explained that it can help study how dogs react to real dogs.
"While many evidence has been found from various mucous membranes that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more information is still available -- and dogs are not exempted in this case," he said.
Although, with the ease of their behavior, it seems that we will probably not have more time to understand why their mood ever shifts to each other.
Alex Turner’s disease caused an Arctic manicure to stop Glasgow Gig
The rock bank, the Arctic Menkiz, has stopped Gig in Glasgow after being tortured by its main singer.
On Friday, the Sheffield group had a program to show on the hydro site in the city.
But their main singer Alex Turner's disease forced them to redefine this show date.
The band's announcement came when they were obliged on Thursday to hold Gig in LG Erina in Bermingham in the same way.
In a statement on his official website, Arctic Menkiz said that after taking medical advice tonight after deciding to stop the show at LG Erina, Arctic Menkiz must also stop the show at Glasgow Hydro on Friday.
"Alex Turner got shot in the test, and they're not very capable of showing."
The show will now be held at LG Arena in Burma on 20 November, and the show will be held at Glasgow Hydro on 21 November.
All tickets will be accepted for this show.
We're sorry for any inconvenience that's going to happen to all the ticket holders.

Pope Francis will announce the first Cardinal in February
Vatican announced to Thursday that Pope Francis would establish the new Cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his work on 22 February.
Cardinals, the high priestess of the Catholic Church, are only below the pope, and these people choose the pope, so Francis will recruit the first group of his people, who will eventually help choose their successor.
There's a total of 201 cardinals right now.
Thus, after 80 years of age, Cardinal is not allowed to participate in the pope's election - it comes in a group of 120 "Cordinary voters".
In a speech announcing the news, Vatican spokesperson Father Federico Lombardy said that all current Cardinals' meetings, known as the Popes, will be held before the ceremony of the New Cardinals.
Lombardy said, "Pop Francis has decided to announce his decision to organize the pope-in-chief of February in order to make it easier to make plans for other meetings attended by Cardinals from different countries."
Jack Vallero of the Catholic Voyage said that by February the number of cardinals was likely to be reduced.
He said that the pope generally announces the number of Cardinal voters as low as 120, both Cardinals, and according to their will, the names of Cardinals over 80 years of age.
Vallero said that next year's Pope's meeting would be important, because this year will be the first Pope's meeting after the election of France in March.
Currently, Europe and especially Italy have a kind of precedent.
He said, "It will be interesting to see whether the new pope, the rest of the world, is using Cardinals to reintroduce the balance.
Forty percent in South America are Roman Catholics, but in Cardinals their number is very low.
Cardinals by Francis, who is a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, whose work is to seek ways of reforming the church, will also be the first to be elected after being formed.
The Pope used to make all the decisions himself.
Valero said, "Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him."
He said it's "possible" to ask the French Cardinals for advice.
But we're not before in this situation - it's completely new.
Vallero said that the pope generally gives the bishop of great places a position of cardinal, but Frances "were going to be quite amazing - so we don't know who they're going to pronounce their name."
Callback to be issued by GM to the U.S.
On Friday, according to information from the U.S. Auto Security Propellers, the General Motors Company has called back nearly 19,000 trucks to correct a deficiency in the hand-to-hand seat in S.S.S.S.S.A.S.P.T.
In some trucks, the front seat rotation system may be reduced.
As a result, the United Nations Auto Security Standards regarding the headrest failed.
According to an information posted on the website of the National Road Safety Administration, "If the vehicle is caught from the rear, it may not be possible to protect the headrest, the proper way of the driver, thereby increasing the risk of injury."
The models were created between August 1 and September 10.
The G.M. truck started being sent to June and, after the 2009 demonstration update, the top shows the most important Vohan Launch for the U.S. Automaker.
G.M. told the truck owners about the mistake in October.
N.S.M. 16-day government ban, which forced an increase in auto sales in October, could not review the owner's announcement letter.
G.M. told Friday that, in the sale of Silverward and Sierra Trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, 20 percent increased in the 10 months before this year.
In October, G.M. sold 42,660 silverware and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
On Friday afternoon, a 1.4 percent increase in GM share in New York Stock Exchange.
The Discouragement of Obama’s Prophecies
I gave Obama twice to expect change
They say Obama's great efforts have been hampered by the opposition policy of the G.O.P.
Obstacles to Obbamaker’s Web site’s policy cannot counteract drone attacks
The 2008 Obama Campaign commemorates what might have happened
There are second-year students at the National P. Moris Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a lot of sad books today.
This is a book about which I think this second year during medical school will encourage me and give me hope.
Its name is "Courage of Victory", and it is the anniversary of the 2008 election campaign of President Barak Obama.
When I get sick in the night, and go to bed, this book takes me to a time where politics has inspired millions and talks could keep your breath.
Elections have been proven, and news speakers have stopped to show the historical importance of the time.
There were tears of joy in the eyes of my fellow workers, and my father and my mother kept all the letters that were found.
A group of young people were going to the White House, and the whole country was ready to change.
In 2008, they had an 82% approval rating during Obama's presidency.
Then I closed the Book.
The present truth is a harsh truth, like returning from the world of dreams.
It's hard to remember those days of hope - they seem to be a distant memory, a painful memory of the times that have passed away.
The first time that I was paid by me was really changed.
Simply say, I couldn't have imagined any of this.
I commend Obama for his many availabilitys, from the Afordable Cairo Act to the back of our army from Iraq, "Don't ask" to the end of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that the policy of opposition has prevented many efforts to move forward in our country: including non-violent reform, public service options, barriers to the closure of Guantanamo Bay, as well as others.
But the many times that I've taken my side of Obama's administration with my colleagues and colleagues, I've got the answer to what I can give them.
I've reached the point of political disappointment.
The Republic's opposition to politics is not the answer to the threat of foreign leaders, nor is it the answer to drone attacks on children in other countries.
This national security agency cannot respond to the collection of data on the personal life of American citizens, nor can it respond to the use of people who expose the wrong practices of the government.
It cannot explain why the U.S. citizen of Unver El District was killed without a trip, nor could it be limited to public law and business limits during the presidential campaign.
It cannot answer the conclusions of the report, which says that the White House's attempt to silence the media "has been the most shocking ever since the Nixon administration."
And last but not least, it cannot justify the failure to design a simple website even three years after it has been signed in the law of Afordable Cairo Act.
I don't know what I was expecting.
If, at 18 years of age, I had to assume that the government system could break the political campaign that would lead to it.
Clearly, the uninhabited office is not a predictive way, because the opposition political groups and memorable events such as the Newtown massacre will shape our public debate.
However, the examples I have given above most of them seem to be chosen by the administration.
This is most disturbing to you.
I voted back for Obama in 2012, but not because I was famous for his hope.
Mitt Romani presented a misleading and uncertain option that did not seem to determine their policies or their position.
It seemed to me that another time would come for Obama, who would be free from the pressure of future elections, to fulfill the hopes that we have long heard.
However, while Obama's license rating is less than 45 per cent this week, it has become very difficult to return to 2008.
When I see him, I remember the promises they've lost.
This week he was reading a portion of the book, which described how Clinton was badly damaged by Obama in Pennsylvania.
At a post-Martam campaign meeting, he told his subordinate workers that they needed to return to the panel, and that they needed to remain faithful to their purposes.
They said, "I want my mojo back."
We should remember who we are.'
Today, five years later, President, I can't agree with you anymore.
The thoughts expressed in this comment are of the Nataniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that P.M. Tony Abbott is a good fighter for the father's holiday plan.
Arab husband M.P. Clive Palmer said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott's good fight about the father's holiday plan is because their daughters may become pregnant and benefit from it.
Maharathi of the Khanan region, like 6 million dollars in carbon, has argued with Bill's payment in the debate, while they have tried to answer questions about the fight.
The Palmer United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which can be important in determining the reduction of carbon and minerals.
But Mr. Palmer claims that only ministers can fight well, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters can benefit personally from politics.
Mr. Palmer said, "There may be an important fight between them in the matter of parental leave, because if any one of them is pregnant, it would be a clear good for them whether or not they are given leave."
Two months after the election, the election campaign officially declared Mr. Pomerer to be the winner of the Sunshine Cost Seat of Firefax with 53 votes after the re-appointment.
Mr. Palmer requested that the process be speeded up to speed up the election.
The daughters of Tony Auto, French and Brigette.
Should the outcome of our choice come two months after we have been awarded?
They said, “We have a better system.”
Why can't we have a system where we fill out our computer details, vote immediately, and have results at 6:30 p.m.
Mr. Palmer also reviewed the use of a brush to mark the letters.
That's because if someone doesn't like it, can you remove it?
The use of pencils during today seems to be completely pointless.
Selection tools, studying options for electronic communications, and recently launched a joint protocol with New Zealand.
59-year-old Mr. Palmer said his policy was to create an international air barrier for Sunshine Coast, and they would take their new work "very seriously".
Public service is for public service.
They said, “We have received a great reward from history, that we may serve the people at this important time; and there is no reward except for what we have received.”
Which caused the adversaries to be troubled.
Referring to the meeting held on this occasion, the Association President Ramesh Lioni voiced a strong complaint about the country's corrupt law system.
They said, "The rebels and their families have been more and more rabid than ever."
They have no fear of the police and the administrative system.
They recently mentioned such events in different places as they said that when the president's society is not safe, the security of the general human being can be easily estimated.
RBS delayed two forex traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign currency, two scientists have received this information from the case, another indication that the global speed of research by investors in the context of the currency market is advancing.
The UBS Barclay, the Dutch Bank and some of the world's largest banks, including RBS, have confirmed that the world's largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion is donated every day, is working with investors.
These two traders will be the first employees of RBS, who have been suspended with further investigation of the alleged recurrence of the Free Interbank Loans.
The bank has refused to comment on the delay and has confirmed that the bank has received a request for information from the investors this month.
Two weeks ago, the bank said, "Our investigation is ongoing, and we are fully cooperating with FCA and other investors."
Last month, scientists said that RBS sent the former trader and sent the archives of e-mails and quick messages to the UK Vinjam, financial behavior authority.
Richard Jusher left RBS in 2010, and it is believed that it has been released from its current position by Forex Spot Trading in J.P.M.
The main European spot trading trip to the city was last week by Rohan Rammedani, while the former superintendent of Korean trading in Barclause and UBS was suspended by the Standard Charter this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrong action.
The case was told by scientists that Mr. Eusher's rapid message group included banks of Barclays and the sitigroup.
UBS said that, after being told by Swiss Vinyamk that she is investigating the foreign currency market in many Swiss bakers, he has been acting against some of his employees this week.
At least six global authorities - European authorities, cinema, Switzerland, FCA, the Justice Department in the United States, and Hong Kong Federal authorities - are investigating allegations of fraud in order to ensure that they have their proper place in the currency market.
People familiar with the case reported that HSBC, Citigroup, J.P.M.G., and Credit Switzerland have also conducted an internal investigation, or have received requests for information from investors.
Banks are looking for a misdemeanor as fast as many years of e-mail and e-mail.
The news of the investigation-reading industry has given rise to confusion in traders in the field, who have been among the most lucrative in the trading unit of investment banks since many years, but are facing this year's challenge because of the low drop-out in the country's banking unit.
Some bankers have tried to suppress the case by saying that it is impossible to transfer a large and too much liquid foreign currency into the exchange market, but top traders say it doesn't have to be true.
The senior trader said that the use of foreign currency in spite of the vast scale of business sales between the separate trading platform and the growing use of its own platform by banks means that "you can start to influence the market on a small scale."
The news came the same day that Credit Switzerland announced its exchange trading funds desk in London to the trader this week, which lost about $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank has immediately notified the co-ordinated authorities and is cooperating with its investors.
Credit Switzerland said, "We believe that the trader worked alone, and he has been controlled."

The Supreme Court supported Obama’s health service law
As a major victory for Obama administration, the U.S. Supreme Court today announced the health service law on behalf of Barak Obama.
From 5 to 4 opinions, judges decided on the basis of the different orders of the health protection and non-caring law - which citizens will need to purchase or punish health before 2014 - that it was within the government's power to prosecute.
Chief Justice John Robert supported the court's four other donor members, while other judges, Scalia, Thos, Elito and Kennedy, won dissatisfaction.
The court has also supported the remaining sections of this law on 2700 pages, and said that the condition of the Health Service Act to increase the eligibility of the state medical profession or that all of them will witness the maintenance of the United Nations medical funds is not fundamentally unfavourable.
This magazine was brought by 26 states and the National Free Business Association to prevent this law.
During the 2012 opening session, this law was opposed by all the main Republican Presidents, including the project-designate Mitt Romaniani.

For many people in society living in terrible despair, we should all think.
In fact, in the men of life, meaning, righteousness, work, and deliverance are equally important.
All men desire riches and prosperity. Their wealth and their gains are in vain in the multitude of men.
The same is true of the wealth that is in store for him.
How much less shall the sinner be rich? how much less shall he be rich? how much less shall he be rich? how much less shall he be rich?
Don't let another man's wealth enrich him.
The true rich is he who made a way for a widow in the number of her hands.
For there is nothing better for a man than to have the good things of life than that of the laborers.

In the case of Nortel Pentant, there is a financial debate on Google, Sassemble, Hawaii.
The group of owners of thousands of former Nortel patents has brought many patents to trial on Thursday, along with cell phone makers, which it had driven into the Nortel pipeline.

Believed in the first freely elected president in Egypt
Mohammed Morsi has sworn his office, but their victory day in Egypt may have ended the political struggle.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised "New Egypt" when he took up his office as the first freely elected president of the country to replace Hosni Basak 16 months earlier.
On its official establishment before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi Arabia has become the fifth president of Egypt, the world's independent first Islamic president, and almost 60 years before the political system was removed.
And they took an oath by the river of the river of the river, even as the ancient Egyptian temple, unto 18 judges who had the charge of the blacksmiths in the court.
Morsi said during an official ceremony on national television show: "We are looking forward to a better future, new Egypt and other republics."
Moorish Muslim Brotherhood, who has been an illegal organization for 84 years since its establishment, and who is on the brink of the last governments, trained engineer at the U.S. party, said, "Today the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life - complete freedom, genuine democracy and stability."
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen protected the building and, according to local time, came to Morsi's small cemetery shortly after 11am.
Only a few hundred supporters were gathered outside the court to congratulate the president's new president from the smoke of the day of May, and the Tatayath was banned for a short time, so that his motor Cafile would leave the usually busy street, which connects the city centre with its southern suburbs.
Bryderhud's inhumanity to be ridiculed as a "kali tire" increased considerably in his personal dignity after his victory, and on Friday his speech not only presented him as a Islamist but as the hope of all those who want to carry out the 2011 conspiracy against the Tanashak.
Morsi, wearing a blue suit and a red tie, took an oath to the judges in the wooden panel, saying: "Today Egypt is a citizen, national, constitutional, and modern nation."
Afterwards, Morsi Cairo went to the university, where they had to give their opening talk.
The army band played nationally and was welcomed by their officials, while they stood in the currency of the alert.
Military governors were also present at Marshall Husan Tantavi.
On their arrival, hundreds of people who attended the University Department of Understanding welcomed the cry "Sena and other people are one hand."
Founded in 1908 as the foundation of an independent religious education, Cairo University later became the foundation of Islamic student groups in 1970.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath in the Square, which is the origin of the uprising, which ended last year in the Tanasak regime, and took an oath to take back the powers of the military leader who had been removed from their position by the military.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the court instead of taking a solemn oath of allegiance to the parliament, they bowed to the will of the military, which indicates that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in the Square was filled with dramatic popular coins.

According to this report, the EU government has spent $8.5 million over the past four years to celebrate the power of the ruling panel.
Instead, during the time of Andy's reign (between 1999 and 2004) in contrast to Modi's claims, there was no announcement by the government during the time of the Attal Bajpei's P.M.P. for two consecutive years (2001-2002).
On Thursday, Modi, based on the image 'Stachu of Unity' of the 182 meters high of the main panel in Gujarat's headquarters, said, "Before this, there was no advertising on the occasion of the main panel's engineers.
While the record of the DVP states that in 2009-10, the EUA spent EUR 30 million, EUR 410 million in 2010-11, EUR 2.7 million in 2011-12, and EUR 1.4 million in 2012-13 on the announcements of the Chief Panel.
When central information and publications were asked from the Minister of Human Rights Tuesday about Modi's claims, they said they do not speak on the basis of the MP candidate facts of BZPP.
There was no advertisement on the panel in 2008.
Tuesday said it was because of the financial crisis that year.

Moving forward with dust, rivers, and forests to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Well, bringing free health services to rural areas in Cameroon
Well and their team see hundreds of diseases every week
There is not much medicine in Western African countries; there is only one physician for 5,000 people
Set your vow here or use your mobile phone
Dr. Georges Well in 2013 is one of the top 10 leaders of the N.N.
You can vote for them or for someone else in the top 10 to make C.N.N. leaders of the year.
The winner will get $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, George Well had seen his sick father come to his senses and faint, going to the hospital, who were not adequately equipped to help them.
Jamel Well, in 1981, a car accident near Cameroon’s capital, Yunde, was injured.
At first they only had a broken hand, but an infection spread to their brain, and he made blood vessels that affected their rest of their lives.
George Well says, "There was no neurosurgery in Cameroon."
If we had money, we would have brought our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Well was taking his father to a large crowd of clinics and hospitals and getting whatever treatment they could get.
He said, “It is not easy.”
You leave home in the morning at 5:00 a.m. hoping you'll be the first to get to the hospital, but it doesn't.
There's a lot of disease there.
Some will lay hold on death, waiting for it.
The situation has not changed much since Well's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one physician for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
If you compare, there is a physician for every 413 people in the United States.
And though there be among them that are wise men, yet many of the inhabitants of Cameroon can't pay for it.
Two out of five people live below the poverty line in the country, and about two thirds of all the public sector in the country.
Well, they say, "They only have a problem with poverty."
And because they are poor, they have no pleasure in their life.
And it came to pass, when he saw the affliction of his father, and of his kindred, that he was determined to satisfy it.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers have treated 700 free blood cells last year.
They themselves became physicians, and began to work as vascular surgeons at the central hospital of Yunde.
And they started a non-profit organization that goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical services.
Since 2008, he and a group of his volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday they sit in the van, and up to 30 people, they take supplies from roof to roof, and they go to rural areas where people need treatment.
Sometimes it doesn't even look like them.
They shall push the chariot more than once out of the rivers and from the dust.
But when they arrive, they really have the honor of having princes: the best home that can be presented by music, dance, and community.
There is a real reason to celebrate free medical services in these villages, and well - with their great smiles and endless energy - is included in it.
The next morning, their team starts meeting with hundreds of sick people.
Well said, "We meet 500 people on each trip."
They come about 60 kilometers from the village, and they walk.
All these weeks provide various types of medical services.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, paralysis, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Other people can get a birth certificate -- the need for this document is in school, but many poor families can't afford it.
In the evening, the group simply undergoes surgery with local surgery.
The operation usually takes place at the school's house, town hall or home; after the process, the disease goes to the place of recovery, and makes room for the next person.
The group publishes Sanitation and Sanitation Services in a room with a generator operation, and works up and up in the morning on Sundays and Sundays.
It's a round speed, but village musicians usually help to motivate the group.
Well, he said, "They're playing games all night to keep us alive and keep our jobs."
Their people return to the city on Sunday. They are weary, but they are proud of their labor.
This group - including Cameroonian medical and foreign medical students - has treated 700 free blood cells last year, and they know that their help can change the world of those they help.
One person said that he would be able to go back to work because of getting free Hernia shelves.
He said, “The future will be changed to me and my family.”
In addition to running weekly clinics and working as a medical practitioner at the hospital, there are also private medical clinics around the city at night.
He said it's their second job that depletes 60% of their non-profit; the rest is filled with private donations.
"I don't know when they're asleep."
They're always in the hospital, or they're trying to make money for their organization, so they can keep doing this.
Students of medicine and nursing, such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join the Well campaign, have a practical opportunity that they can never get in their country.
O'Malley said, "We're helping to capture a tool for Dr. Well in gynecology or clean up blood clots, in which we're able to gain practical experience."
You'll never get the chance to do that as a second year medical student in America.
Voluntary students usually work for themselves to get to Cameroon, and they often come with donations' medical supplies.
But after the years are come, they shall be filled with the east wind, and with the east wind.
O'Malley says, "There is no doubt that they are heroes."
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon will never end.
For Well, there's almost one job load, not a challenge.
Helping others to live a happy life, fulfilling the promise made to their father, these are things that bring great joy to them.
Well, they say, "I'm very happy to do this."
And I think about my father.
I hope they'll see what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh, to ease their pain.

This mystery has brought the U.S. government into co-existence with its partner countries.
Speaking through a video link to a free government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: "There is no question that the president, me, and others in the government really knew about some things that would happen with automatic pilots, because looking back at the difficult years of World War II, and the cold war, and then, certainly at 9/11, it was able to do so.
They have become members of the top U.S. government, who have admitted that the U.S. Joshua has reached its limit, but insists that no one's rights have been misused.
They said, “This is a matter of great importance.”
And the presidents are determined to try to explain it to people and are still scrutinizing thoroughly so that no one will feel abused.
I assure you that nothing is going wrong with innocent people in this process.
