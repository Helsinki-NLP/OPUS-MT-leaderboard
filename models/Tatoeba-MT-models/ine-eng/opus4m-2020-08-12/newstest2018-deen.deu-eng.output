Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
It's a wrong place to meet young people today.
A tomb chapel where the S-Bahn tunnel will now be dug.
Small farmers take advantage of the unique reason for farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to days.
It's nervous if land cards aren't up to date.
This is known to anyone who had to get excited once because the car-navi showed a green light instead of a road.
The historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlas, an offer of the geoportal Bayern of the state government, are everything but current - but that is why it is very clear.
Especially when compared with current online cards.
Then it will become clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the München Mercury area since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern Atlas is a flip-floor carpet that you don't even recognize as such.
More detailed maps, called Urposition Sheets, were incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
According to the Bavarian Measurement Administration, these came from 1810 to 1864 and originated from Bayern's first measurement.
Her employer: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bayern since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographical recording of Bayerns on command - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops with the peace of Lunéville of 9 February 1801 finally withdrew: It was the current neighbours who created the idea of a covered Bavarian map.
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Measurement Administration.
The Urposition Sheet for Munich comes from 1856 and is found like all others on the website of the Bavarian Landesbiblioth.
The comparison early today is the most impressive in the example of the capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is a subsendling that still appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was registered 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877, as München district.
Today subsending lies in the center of the city.
The Houses of Unsendings focus around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, you see nothing as a field - at first glance: At the Iine zoom, there appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-numbered tiles from the so-called "reception", from which the basic tax was derived.
There are no farmers there today - but small farmers of the installation "Land in the Sun".
A large green area is drawn north from shipping.
The Theresiawiese, since 1810 the scene of the October festival, was, in fact, still a meadow - and not a concrete desert in the 19th century.
On the other side of the Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt you can read not only the street name "am Gasteig" in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen, but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße, people were once locked up with crazy ideas.
In 1858/59 the München County Irrenastalt "On the Auer Luften" was founded.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - the psychiatrist brought in in connection with the death of King Ludwigs II.
"He was progressing for his time and, for example, ended the survey of the so-called errors.
In addition, he has prevented staff from resorting to violence against the insatiables," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the museum of Haihausen, who has been involved in an exhibition with the institution.
For 280 patients, there was first room, and then it was extended to 500 places.
At one time this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circuit assembly in Haar 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatry.
On the area of the former Auerstalt, young people in the München Salesianum meet.
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training companies.
Western is the football pitch of the TSV Munich East, eastern residential houses from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in an architectural building at the origins of the Irenanstalt, which was destroyed during the Second World War by bombing.
The Marienplatz was listed around 1856 as "Main Square", the Kaufingerstrasse called "Kaufinger Gasse".
A decisive change also brought World War II into the heart of Munich.
In December 1944, the Allies bombed many holes in the city centre.
A large one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof, where these days the preparations take place and on April 5, 2017 the spatenstik for the second S-Bahn-Stemmstrasse.
With the slide rule, the old Munich card can be compared to today's sky picture - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.
Citizens' Rights Group Releases Travel Warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Coloring has issued a warning for colouring people travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the Federal State Missouri, which is scheduled to enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to pay particular attention to travel by the State and to be given the utmost attention, as a number of questionable, race-based events have occurred in recent times throughout the state and are noted here," the group said in its opinion.
A recently adopted law by Missouri, which makes it more difficult for people to win calls for discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the State, which aim disproportionately at minorities, motivate the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
"You have violations of citizens' rights that happen to people.
They will be stopped because of their skin color, they will be beaten or killed," said President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard."
It is the first such warning that the organisation has issued for a state in the United States.
The group quoted events such as racist acts against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no gas through the state and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The Council also points to a recently published report by the Office of the Attorney General of Missouri showing that black drivers in the state are being stopped 75 percent more frequently than white.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People must be willing to bring bail or let their relatives know that they travel through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report programme, which ranked the state in relation to the number of such violations on the 16th grade of the country.
The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to report a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had passed immigration laws, which required local criminal prosecution authorities to arrest people for violations of immigration, which, according to ACLU, would contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent years interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Widespread project is elemental
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year.
The CDU Bundestags Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on site.
At the cemetery of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fisherbacher CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs.
Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into his farm, where he farmed 55 hectares of Wiesen and 40 hectares of forest, provided 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and stayed in five apartments.
The "black forest milk" is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, as Schwendemann says.
On the table of the holiday guests comes only regional.
Since he is also BLHV president of Fischerbach, he called the breeding project "legislative".
I can't make profits on such steep areas.
The green area ensures a lot of work, a lot has to be done with the engine sensation.
"We have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," said Schwendemann.
In 2003, he took over parenting and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilisers, even if he did not conduct a bio-based operation.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the breeding project and is pleased with the Leader funding".
At the cost of EUR 3000 to EUR 4000 per hectare, farmers had to be supported.
It is hoped that this could lead to the recovery of the area for a long time.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to carry on their business," the mayor stressed.
Farmers are often criticized for their support
In 2013 a total of 25 parcels of 11 participants were allocated over the area.
The surface of the opening shall be 40 hectares, which shall not be deforested until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half were promoted over Leader, one quarter was borne by the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, the farmers stayed at 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture.
"The great advantage is the longevity of the teeth," Schwendemann said.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You do a very good job, without farmers and farmers it is not".
Also for Peter Weiss: "Here are the best foods produced".
The Baden-Württemberg Landscape Board (LPR) makes it possible to promote the state aid of Weidezaun.
The aim is to reveal the Black Forest.
The requirement is the existence of a funding facility designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be depleted must not be manageable (dependence over 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by deforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaun project 2018, the application of eight participants is currently being made with 24 parcels that would like to build almost 16 kilometres of zau.
The surface area corresponds to 35 hectares, the estimated costs are more than 112,000 euros.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Now the White House of Trump takes over the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate these as well as any other – therefore the carefully staged crash Saddam Husseins on the Firdo Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the president's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration with the status of freedom.
To stay fair, Miller did not attack the statue himself.
A bunch of boat owners and Liberty-Imitators would have licked him if he had.
But he attacked their significance, and in particular the meaning they were assigned, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the Memorial, was added to its foundation.
When Miller Acosta grumbled: "I don't want to go into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you refer to was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Freedom."
Miller is right, but as he himself formulated it, it's not really about history.
It is the contemporary resonance with the words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor,/your troubled masses who look forward to breathing freely,/the miserable waste of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "poor waste" was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trumps USA are not welcome.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural dispute: it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends, who used to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they had performed a high-political action.
The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism by representing the female incarnation of freedom in a classic image.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of the exiles.
The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.
The great scream Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Freedom did not invite anyone, but rather was an early neoconservative, which brings the American flame to the naked world: "Lady Liberty goes on.
It is intended to carry the factor of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The factor is not intended to lighten the way to the United States."
It's quite unusual that Limbaugh has hit something here.
The importance of the statue is quite a question of the position of perception.
The great fanciful act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the decks of ships.
It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they need to hear.
And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.
Their arrows shall not lighten the way, but they shall set on fire the hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the team of Great Britain
Eilid Doyle remembers a time when only two shots were part of the team of Great Britain
The performance director of the UK Light Athletes, Neil Black, says that the 16-head Scottish contingent in the world championship team will "give a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "she's developing something special in Scotland" and the UK's light athletics must learn something about it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we discover it," Black said.
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they've done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they've done.
British Light Athletes: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medalists, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will join Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000m route, while Eilid Doyle was elected team captain.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Your captain's speech was unbelievable," Black says.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they lived or trained, left the room and felt very proud and very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Elidh naturally brought in were great."
The Commonwealth Silver Medal winner, who will take part in her fifth World Championships at the 400m Curtains, says it is "unbelievable" that there are 16 shots in the British team.
So far, Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The middle runner Muir is leading this way and has established five British and two European records last year.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m running.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another shot to be observed after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships when she was the only other shot in team Lee McConnell.
The team captain says that she is "extremely proud" of the fact that many of her countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases also involved in the medals and finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was such a great honor, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added.
"I'm obviously very proud of all the shots that belong to the team.
It only shows how far we've come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb the podium.
What about my speech as a captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I have just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship.
So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it'll just be such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Do not apply for a public office if you cannot delay the heating of voters
The father of our country knew something bad about the press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers beat him for everything, from internal politics to his political principles.
He smacked the critique, sure.
But he didn't silence his critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said: "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and stupid, we are led like the sheep to slaughter."
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who must work to be more like Washington.
Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union complained to him this early this week.
The Governor's staff dismissed the complaint as free, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?" .
"It's just Facebook," said many people.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is admirably popular.
He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary heathead.
He has shown a firm hand in guiding his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very skilled in using Facebook as the primary means of connecting with his voters and playing his hairless head to chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of persons who come to the Governor's side - which is a public forum, which is called an official forum and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokesperson Amelia Chase defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or greedy people who swing the peitches online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
These are only true people who speak to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a father, no troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, M., was not filled with hate, but she asked for hate crimes.
"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comment area of the "The Post".
"I don't appreciate this idea either, if a number of people take a stand on the same subject, then they are missed by some rather than a so-called collective action and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."
What the Governor's employees call "concentrated spam attack" would probably be called "provocation".
The Facebook era makes it easy to post a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guiding articles or arrest and silence demonstrators.
But that's exactly what's happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is accused of Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoon County violated the First Amendment, according to US District Director James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of the available port had a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous mailers applied for his guidance.
And even then Washington had an anonymous troll.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions that criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, Trade and Shipping with Great Britain, dominated his office, according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project's Online Papers.
But he didn't silence her.
Freedom of speech, diversity of opinions and speeches are the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Raferty hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Raferty will hope for home comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will hold the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Ireland, which led to the end of the Archerfield Links last year, before losing Paul Eales, is associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the association's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen how the Renaissance Club was built, and we see how he achieved his fame with this event," said Raferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great condition.
Jerry did a great job when he set up this place.
He is a zealous accuser of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great show window for this course."
England Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although in his 32-year career he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"That really feels special," said the player who lived in Southport.
"I have not been able to defend the Extremadura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won it.
Back to this part of the world is magic.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories come back from last year, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to the action on home ground.
This event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburg.
"You want to do well, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing it again, and I played a solid golf.
I'm happy to see how it has gone so far."
With the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six shots on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmour and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free of charge, the parking lot costs £5 per car with one inset and £10 per car with two or more insets.
All proceeds go to prostate cancer UK.
Less lung cancer caused by passive fertilisation
In the past two decades fewer and fewer people have died from passive lung cancer.
This results in a study by scientists at the Hamburg-Eppendorf University Hospital (UKE).
"According to our estimates, 167 cases of lung cancer are due to passive fertilisation per year," said Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he conducted his own study on this topic in 1994.
At that time, there were still 400 lung cancer cases due to passive use per year in Germany.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
House connections turn out to be very complex
The construction works in the Villelinger Straße are in full swing and "almost in time", according to the head of the Bauhof Fred Heinze.
In the area of household connections, the situation is more complicated than expected, as there is much hiding in the background, which is not seen in the plans.
Transport, which is constantly hampering construction, is a major problem for the construction company Stumpp.
"The driver's ignorance of red lights and shutters is already enormous," Heinze reports.
The road was blocked and only the buses were entitled to the passage.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been busy working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were already very exciting.
But luckily we were provided by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and Death in Indonesian Goldland
If Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a herd.
She even rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Panai Regentity in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potatoes - locally referred to as "not" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the frozen knoll will be taken and swallowed with ferocious, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the floor - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work, e.g. washing clothes with running water from the nearby sponge.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrines.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, they were not assigned fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course it can be dangerous to work late: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are the soldiers here.
"No one dares to walk around the village after 5:00," she says.
It is a rare view of daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was admitted to Indonesia after a controversial referendum in 1969, as only 1,026 elders should vote through a public holding before the occupying forces.
An existing movement that raised independence against the Dutch government quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea covering the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is. The trip consists of a 90-minute flight from Jayapura Province to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive by car.
There is no public transport.
The town of about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo pillars and well-sighted roofs that have been converted by rust into various yellowish tones.
Only very few Indonesians have made their journey here, silent because journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing this dress," says Degei, indicating on her vivid hand-woven turbane, her dark shirt and her bright rock.
"In the past, we only had leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's gold country.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grassberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Panai, a highland province of the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport lost 3.1 billion dollars of gold and copper.
Furthermore, Papua has wood resources worth estimated $78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of misery for the Papua, which ensures that the powerful military of Indonesia retains a stifling presence.
A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid almost 20 million dollars to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gans and are treated without grace.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and arrested by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass meetings in Papua Nationality in the 1970s were held in accordance with the Asian Human Rights Commission on Human Rights.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We'll lose everything" means in a 2016 report by the Archdiocese Brisbane, which contains reports on the atrocities of the previous year, such as illegal facilities and torture - rape and electric shocks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal defeat of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims, as events happen every week," says Andreas Harrisono, Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have increased as Papua's resources bring a flood of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development changes as Muslim economic migrants come from the islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warning canteens sell fried chicken and Gado-Gado, serving a mixed vegetable with groundnut juice.
Local people fight to stay here.
"The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Panai native who moved to Jayapura Province.
"It has cost the local Papua - the mother [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi in the Volksmund, promised to address the inequalities and legal violations in Papua during his 2014 election.
The former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Panai, on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua has changed little, and today the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because we have voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," you say.
In fact, Panaii only suffered two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas songs before a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the dark on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them that they should turn on their flashlights.
One of the soldiers attacked her and came back with four soldiers later, so local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk, hunted and beat the group with their guns, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers set fire to the group of the children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set in fire and things were escalating the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a football court in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and led the Waita dance - in the circle running and imitating a bird song - from Papua Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators began to smear stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, an internal radio command was sent to the soldiers: "If the masses withstand more than three times, they shoot them dead," says an official document by TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Jeremias Kayame, 56, head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, looked at the threat and cried for rest and asked the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, suddenly I was shot in my left wrist," he said TIME on the porch of his painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overloaded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was met three times, so his cousin was the witness of the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was," said John, who, like many Indonesians, bears only one name, the TIME in a dark mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The Chief Inspector of Papua Police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers wanted to "safe up" their station because they were being attacked.
"We need to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many others were injured.
The news of the murders came to Jakarta only the following day 'filtered'.
For three weeks Jokowi in Jayapura gave a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to address the historical misconceptions in Papua.
"I want this case solved immediately, so it will not happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wirtano said in October 2016 that he was setting up an extrajudicial mechanism to deal with historical human rights violations.
But the reasons began almost immediately.
"Most of the injuries occurred long ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to dealing with these violations, but there are processes that have to go through," he said.
Then Wirtano withdrew when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5th and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "all things are legal," he said.
Wirtano, who was accused by the UN of "crime against humanity", who claimed more than 1,000 deaths in the East of 1999 in the bloody independence vote, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been reported, including the Panai incident.
Families of the Panai victims responded to such claims with gross infidelity.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there's been no progress," says John.
"I'm tired."
He says he's still living in fear years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid to be arrested by the military, afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people in Panai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After burying the bodies, the military was looking for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot at village residents in Paniai's neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man into the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drunk when he fished in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested at the company's location office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing fires.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panicked, we're afraid there's going to be a rache," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and was witnessing how the injured were quickly delivered here, says the TIME.
"I hid two days in my house."
The Deiyai Parliament has called on interested officers to be taken into account and to withdraw the police mobile brigade from the area.
Panaii was always an unrest for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the dissatisfaction of the indigenous Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of the Papua by attacking sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Panai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, thousands of people in Panai have been arrested and voluntarily taken into custody in recent years, under the pretext of "safety of national sovereignty".
Some never show up again.
Among the people in Papua is Panai known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty reinforces dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as wide as rich.
People here build on everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leaves.
Agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They retain most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
In the course of time, economic inequalities between the local Papua and the new migrants have grown, which have reached a larger number since the opening of new flights to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs available in the region tend to go to better-trained and well-poor migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, president of Panai's tribal council.
Insulation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting are being tightened up by international media.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim China, the Deputy Asian Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi's election struggle, to remove the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report Indonesia's restless eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: Visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
Lack of pressure control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "different and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Panai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The spokesperson for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group's proposals and said in Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to hide the evidence for human rights cases."
People want more foreign governments to know about this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura visited on 4 May, locals broke their silence and "We want freedom", according to a source that also wants to take part in the meeting, but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papua says they will probably not vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Panai shootings," says Gobai, president of the Family Council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Panai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a thief, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Panai people, like other Papuans, view their voice for Jokowi as a "debt" that he has to repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and humiliations, families of the Panai victims carried out a final symbolic act of pride: the body of a victim was buried on a site right opposite the police and the military station.
They know that justice may never come to them, but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with his head down.
"What else can we do?"
Fires capture the 'Torch' cloud crater of Dubai for the second time
On Friday, a fire was found in one of the world's highest residential towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee 79-storey buildings.
It is the second fire, which in just two years is damped by the high house, which is randomly called the Torch Tower (Fakkel Tower).
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We have slept and we have risen at the fire alarm and at the cry of the people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor," said a resident who named George, Reuters.
Dubai Civil Protection Authorities said that the fire fighting units at 4.00 local time (0.00 GMT) wiped out the fire and cooled down the building.
The government said it was working on providing accommodation for the affected.
The event can revitalize questions about the safety of materials used in external areas of high-rises throughout the world.
A survey of the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage from the coating, the outer coating for decoration or insulation occurred.
In Britain, the police said that they believed that the system of plates for insulation and coating at the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid expansion of a fire, with about 80 people dying.
No Davis-Cup Reform: Next Best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Association (ITF) was held with his large Davis Cup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup singles was not supported by the necessary two-thirds majority.
Although the very long but therefore highly estimated five-satet classics remain in the traditional competition.
63.54% of the Member States voted in favour of the reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was not missing.
"We respect this decision, but we are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions," Haggerty said.
You will continue to work to improve the application.
Not even after many objections had been put to the vote had the proposal to put the finals in a neutral position.
New from 2018 are only relatively smaller details: The finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the next year in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements in things training places etc. will have to be facilitated and players will have to complete less official media terms before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. travellers bring prohibited items to the plane, find out a survey
A survey of air passengers revealed that more than 20 per cent of prohibited items were smuggled through the checkpoints of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 per cent that entered the aircraft, while carrying deliberately prohibited knives or other items with bells.
Less than 1 per cent claimed that they had late discovered that they were mistakenly traveling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a Jet Charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travellers did not respect the rules.
Of the respondents who claimed that they had scientifically tried to fly with something forbidden by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared with less than 15 percent who were members of the X generation.
The most common items that were deliberately translucent to TSA agents were food and fluids.
More than 3 per cent of women surveyed and 3.7 per cent of male surveyed confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the plane.
The company said it had asked travellers throughout the country to find out how many smuggled goods had accidentally brought through the airport security and how many had deliberately done it.
It is no surprise that people who carry the most common smuggler - whether scientific or unscientific - through the security of those who were the most frequent flyers.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain what liquids they may take or how much of it.
It is therefore no surprise that the largest amount of liquids seized by the TSA is prohibited.
For a long time, people thought that TSA could view books as smuggler.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't matter: Ten thousand Tesla customers cancel order
Electro-thousandsassa Elon Musk is happy to announce with the huge number of pre-orders for its new Tesla "Model 3".
He has so far suggested that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-during triumphal numbers of sales increases and even more gigantic paragraphs, Tesla Chief Elon Musk has for the first time betrayed another, less brilliant number when announcing the latest quarterly balance sheet: the cancellations of the new mass market model 3.
Musk had often made more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car in recent months, the delivery of which has just begun.
Now Musk admits: Of the total 518.000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is only non-binding reservations.
In the event of cancellation, Tesla pays 1000 euros (US$ 1000 in the United States and US$ 1000 in the United Kingdom) "reservation payment" completely.
At present 455,000 such non-binding reservations are presented, including muscle in a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla Chief does not believe that the cancellation of about 12 percent of all orders could become a problem.
Its argument: The challenge of ambitious growth goals is not demand, but on the production side.
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
2018 should - all models combined - be 500,000, 2020 one million.
The demand for this is clearly there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 bookings per day.
Whoever orders a "model 3" today will be allowed to count the delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest – if Tesla manages to run its brand new, never-tested production roads in practice without major interruptions with maximum wear.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are more delays, the incompatibility of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent unsatisfied customers from running out of it in the crowd.
EPA Chief Pruitt withdraws due to the withdrawal of the Obama-Era rules to reduce emissions
One day, after he was charged with 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Authority, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama rules in order to reduce emissions of Smog-related air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency demonstrated the needs of state environmental authorities towards faster response than previous administrations.
He did not mention the complaint brought against his previous seat in a Federal Court of Appeal.
It is a deadline that expired on 1 October for States to comply with the standards of 2015 for groundnut ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone compliance for a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "insuming in local decisions or hindering economic growth".
Pruitt, who was President Donald Trump State Attorney of Oklahoma before his appointment, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental protection rules.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry oppose.
The sudden turn of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory Rollback Agenda.
Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator had exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama Administration, which the oil and gas companies required to monitor and reduce methaneleks.
In an opinion published on Wednesday, Pruitt proposed that its conversion to ozone standards simply reinforce the EPA's willingness to cooperate with States through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then expected to be charged by groups of activists and others and to agree to set the deadline for implementation," said Pruitt, who complained to the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in a regulation through judicial proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority that exists to us seriously."
However, the EPA opinion stated that Pruitt would at some time use his "power to delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules "based on a sound policy and the best information available".
The Republicans at the Congress insist on a more comprehensive revision of the ozone rules.
A draft legislation approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
New York's Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had accused the EPA this week, said the group intended to maintain the legal pressure.
"The return of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and those over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Ground ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives of public health and environmental protection rejoiced over the surprising change of course.
"It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to take this reasonable step by the air protection officer we breathe into," said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the ideological crusade of the Trump government to offer ourselves to environmental polluters and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 Years of St. Hilarius-Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 p.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hillary facility is a popular place to stay.
Visitors of the sixth Beneficial Series can be fascinated by this powerful place.
The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the place have made the friends and supporters of Tumlingen their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It's a unique small village."
In 1267 the St. Hilariuskappel was first mentioned in the Württembergish author's book: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church on it to Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Master Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.
The text of the decree was based on the Tumlinger Berg, other than the unique parish church, also a royal court, to which the church or the right of patronage belonged and not vice versa.
So people lived there too.
As the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt of 1858 shows, it was next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which today are still to be seen in the local image of Tumlingen, the "berg" of the third, the dominant settlement center of the village.
Old maps from the time around 1600 support these historical events.
The right of patronage arose from the early Middle Ages self-church law.
A man who built, equipped and possessed a church with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this own church.
This was linked to the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two was broken on Christmas in 1673.
The newly created bells were released for the first time in 1692, but later in World War II in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648), the windows were struck and the bells were stolen.
The roof was away.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the chancellor and church chairs and used them as firewood.
The rest of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius Church was abolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
In the New Year's night in 1834 a storm split the church tower and the half collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was destroyed.
Only the tower tower that still exists today was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter What of the "Schaffigen Rentners" as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius plant.
On Sunday, July 16th, the friends and supporters of Tumlingen invite the 6th Serenade to the old cemetery to St. Hilariuskappel.
This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Mayor Hartmut Romann speaks the closing words.
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.
Starting at 3.30 p.m.
To the sound of the serenade, a circuit takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view of the meadows towards the forest," the eventers set out the fantastic view.
The Serenade only takes place in dry weather.
The organizers look forward to many supporters to receiving the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is important for Tumlingen and Earsweiler.
The friends and sponsors of Tumlingen feel particularly obliged to provide home care, as confirmed by Serenade-Organizer Walter Martini.
Association wants to check the approval of windmills
"Boisheim resists" does not see any legal condition for the construction and has therefore turned to the Land Council.
The Boisheim Association called on Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the establishment of planned wind power plants in the Boisheim network.
It has been illegal.
The association argues that at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheim network, no wind power plants could have been approved, since only at the time of fours there was a wind power concentration zone at the city border in Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind power plants are generally possible, but at the same time, the concentration zone excludes the use of wind power for the rest of the city.
Such zones should prevent a "sparing" of the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheim network a few days earlier by changing the area use plan - but the district government did not approve Düsseldorf because of a form error.
"Because of the lack of planning conditions, the decision granted is still contrary to the law and should therefore also be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, President of Boisheim.
Current state of affairs: Before the summer break, the city council again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim network; approval of the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "In this case, the granting of an authorisation for the setting up of wind energy installations is not subject to planning law".
The circle confirms the receipt of the call.
"The corresponding letters have been taken up at the Fourth Circle since last week," said one speaker.
The circle takes the opportunity to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not likely to result in the termination of the procedure.
In view of the ongoing proceedings before the Administrative Court, on Thursday, the circuit did not intend to make a substantive statement on the argumentation of the Boisheim Association.
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning on an area on the Boisheimer Nette the construction of four 200 meters high windmills.
Already last year, the company in which the city of Foursen is directly involved had concluded agreements with the owner of some 65 hectares of large land.
With the establishment of the four wind power plants, the electricity needs are to be met by around 11,400 households - about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four households.
The NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
In the past summer, Viersen City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind power plants in the Linnich wind park near Aachen as well as for participation in a wind power plant in the Heinsberg district of Übach-Palenberg.
Car and tractor crash: woman dies in a terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwalmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was mortally injured.
Two others were easily injured.
The road was blocked for hours.
According to police reports, a 17-year-old woman from Bornich with her car in the context of her 53-year-old mother's escorted the L 333 towards Bogel.
City and trader plan "home-shops" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region will discover the shopping opportunities in the city in September.
The association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9, to lure the residents into the city's shopping mall.
As the president of the Business Association, Christian König, announced, the "home-shop" weekend should raise awareness of what offers the city itself apart from the usual supermarket goods.
Therefore, a market with regional providers is planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, domestic companies are expected to present themselves with their training sites.
In addition, the shops of the city center are to invite you to the "Memorning Shop".
The action is not only aimed at the inhabitants of the city and the nearest region.
Advertising spots on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags pointing to the weekend of action, says Christian King.
City administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
In this way, the business association and the city go to another stage of the project "Attractive City".
This includes new offers such as the first "Activ-day" of the well festival as well as a sunny Sunday, discussions with all traders and hosts to move them to active participation.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the cancellation of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential should be re-established or re-liquidated.
This includes students and tourists.
But many locals would have lost sight of the city when they bought it.
At the end of the day, everyone had to contribute to the urbanisation of the city - up to renting, the farms of the entire city and associations.
The king had said in the spring that it was worth overcoming the lethargy with a network that had become part of it.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK Centre in Mühlhausen, told us that the third day of "home shopping" was the first time five cities of Thuringia.
Besides Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherrode.
The day is to "advertise for the value of local trade and enhance its importance for the common good of our cities", says Streich.
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his or her own direct environment with his or her purchasing behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
During construction, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New more people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine others were injured, some of them heavy.
According to the firearm, on Wednesday (local time) there was still an injured person in critical condition.
A man died when a part of a school building exploded in the explosion.
A first missing person was later also killed.
In the case of the dead, it was the employees of the school.
As an accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday season, only a few people stood in the building of the Minnehaha Academy.
Trump put pressure on Mexico by telephone calls after secure transcripts due to the payment of the border wall
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto asked to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. president insulted him because he had publicly pushed the wall. According to reports, he said to him, "You can't say that to the press."
Trump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the United States, and vowed to have Mexico pay for the project.
The transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed an intense exchange.
Mr. Trump said that a trade for the United States of America would be "laughing", "mimes" and "mute" and that the existence of the trade communicated by the Obama government would make it look like a "depp" after he had proposed a ban on the relocation of refugees to the United States.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he had said Mr. Turnbull, "this is the most unpleasant call for all day."
Moores Ford Massacre: Activists conduct racist Lynchat as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of viewers in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rushed to the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver who could reach the bridge, a group of white men came out with guns to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle-striped suit - took a long train on his cigarette and looked through the windshield.
Drinnen swam the insasses in fear.
"We want this n----r Roger!" said the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
Screams tear the silence when a young black man was torn by the driver's seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22nd, is just a setup.
But when a snake is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience is really thirsty.
Since 2005, lawmakers have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were escorted by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one was ever charged with the murder.
"It is really hard to see that no one has been arrested in all these years - even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the organization of the settlement.
"It's a dirt stain on a story, but it's a burden for our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifelong citizen.
For him, the legacy serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want termination, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need to get justice," he said.
"We can't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
One of the victims of the Moore-Ford-Lynchen on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI records received from NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding Counties were suspected in the Lynch process.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects have been free on foot for decades, citizens say that the dual motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city has always been known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court enabled the black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer.
About the same time as the election, according to the FBI, the black farmer Roger Malcom put down a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the city was that Hester slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore didn't come from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to release Malcolm from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when they left the prison and approached the Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared the murder and arranged it," a FBI report concludes.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local prosecution, which was not only involved in the murders, deleted the evidence and misled the identity of witnesses."
Brooks is making it even more impressive.
"It was a right-wing massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you register and if you vote, this will happen to you here."
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene led the annual setting-up of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Its presentation is spectacular, fascinating and is based in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe that it no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and it's harder to watch, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the Lynch, because then we'll be confronted with his abomination in us all," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or not want to hear what I've done."
The samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors – a dozen whites and the rest blacks – began in a room and listened as Greene started a well-recorded overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director.
For years he has played the role of the head member of the clan, but he said the role will never be simpler.
"I feel dirty because I'm not," Marbaugh said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to go back to these times."
On the other side of the room, the actors Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The piece begins with Malcolm, the horse, and he's upset, angry that he's slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n-- he, get out of my property!"
Rascona fires.
There's a break.
Then every man -- at least every black actor -- will burst into mockery.
Green laughs at the most.
"What??" asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still kicking.
"I just don't think that white people said a -- he said it at the time."
"But," was one of the other black actors.
"You just have to meet the hard 'R.'."
And right there the energy shifts into space, a feeling of friendship replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it sharply and with emphasis.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a tearful dress, stands over the bodies of the actors and runs Billie Holidays' sad lobrede "Strong Fruit".
Her voice breaks at every second word.
About a hundred meters behind is a group of about four dozen viewers waving sweat and tears out of their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple from Ithaca, New York, are interested in seeing the performance, many only come down the street.
You've experienced nearly eight hours of pressing humidity in Georgia when Brooks takes her on a pilgrimage to the graves of Malcoms and Dorseys.
To this point, the murders have remained an anecdotes, but now that you stand in the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels splendour.
When the last notes of the song fade out, Greene invites the quantity to come closer and inspect the body name.
Children shake at their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," complains a little boy when he wants to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the amount - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the Lynchseil and wipe off their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbough, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his fellow players and then tears down in her arms, the emotional burden of the performance breaks through with him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know it's not in your heart.
You did it for a reason."
Later, the audience gathers with the actors for dinner.
On a table, a white couple from Atlanta are excited about the setting with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that left the performance feeling.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... come from people who look like you and do it because they look like you," she said.
"What is really doing with me is letting me believe that the Lynch is still going on," she added, "now it's just called police shooting."
In the same room Tyrone Brooks Hof holds his table, eats and remembers the rights of citizens.
He said he's already started planning the show next year.
"The setting is in a way inspiring, because it describes the horrors of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's like if we don't learn anything from it, then it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, those who do not know their own history, are condemned to repeat it."
"God damnation" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf puts on a bout-free stage in front of a giant, six-story cult.
The turning stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) has a shady street corner as well as wallrest and dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elaste" logo from DDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before, an open Mercedes-Oldtimer is parked in which the Rhenets pose as rock girls, or alternatively an Iseta.
Mounted oil barrels remember Castorfs Leitmotiv - money, power and greed - which is drawn through his "ring" stage.
The three Rheinth daughters - singing by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonise as wonderfully as in the "Rheingold".
Kess is seigfried (Stefan Vinke), smashing into Hollywood manier a body into the trunk and giving the Krawallo-Clicke.
Stephen Milling sings the beautiful fairy tale surrounded by the Aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he beat victory fried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) must also believe in it.
The audience thanks it to the ensemble with strong applause.
Stormy celebrations are celebrated by Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who humble themselves and pretend to bow their hands to the brand-red.
There is a great coincidence for the concert orchestra, which is shown on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in military leisure clothing.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his director team was expected with excitement.
If he had yet to perform a valid pipe concert in 2013, there was a great jubilee five years later in which the individual "Buh" calls went down.
Festive Chief Katharina Wagner must have been happy about this.
"It is noted that the audience has grown up with the "ring" in a certain way," she had said shortly before the dpa performance.
The public has not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it has also grown an understanding of its view.
I'm drawing a positive summary.
Max Quantity works as a volunteer
They work in several places in their volunteer year.
Anywhere?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture stock exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I've been working at school all day.
How are your experiences with this?
Quantity: It is a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You're 26 years old now, so you're a late volunteer.
How's it going?
Quantity: I made Abitur.
And then a construction engineering study, let's say, was successful.
I found out to myself that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else to work with people.
And then I asked myself what you were doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight, then you can see how it is on the spot, perhaps at the focal point, is real.
And was it?
Quantity: I have collected great impressions.
I'm going to start my study in social life in the winter semester.
I will study dually, probably do social work training in Jugendamt Herne and study in Hamm at the university.
Is it not unusual to have several different places of employment during volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
I guess it always comes to where you're doing your FSJ.
You can do it from home to youth - in all possible aspects of social work.
In my case, it was very different.
I was also part of the OGS, that is, in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly the right thing to do.
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really was going.
Unlike in the building engineering studio?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating stats.
You always have other people in mind who each have a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee or a youth who has been taken out of the family - you must always enter into it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any concerns?
Quantity: I'm not the type for this.
It's an area that's a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but that's how life is.
Pearson reduces another 3,000 jobs and reduces dividends to revive the business
The British education group Pearson said on Friday that they would build up another 3,000 jobs and reduce their intermediate dividends by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme would be launched to overcome the pressure the company is facing.
In addition to its previous restructuring, which had already lost 4,000 seats, the decommissioning announced mainly by Director General John Fallon for the end of 2018 and early 2019.
In May, Pearson announced in a third cost reduction programme a cost reduction plan of another $300 million (US$ 394 million) to revitalize a business that has been taken through the rapid step towards digital learning.
The company, which had sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it had achieved an increase of 1 per cent to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Convoi attack by Kabul: NATO soldier killed in a suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Kabul, killed a NATO soldier, and injured several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a statement from NATO was given.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians died in the incident in Qarabagh district.
Bombing is the last violence Afghanistan has experienced this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
In an opinion by NATO, the explosion occurred on Thursday night when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "improvised bombing carried by persons".
The statement says that all victims are in a stable condition and are treated at the Bagram airport in the US military hospital.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabahh is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1.662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had committed this attack.
On 31 May, a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the country's most deadly militant attack, since 2001 the US-led troops forced the Taliban out of power.
Violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops supporting military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a public confidence crisis in the government, their policies and, in particular, in the name of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPO reverses decision to delay the Smog rule after complaints
The U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has a decision to postpone the regulation of the Obama government, which obliges the states to suspend the Smog emissions, which took place one day after 15 states complained to the Agency for the move.
On Wednesday, the EPA announced the decision to proceed with the so-called "Ozone Regulations 2015", and said it indicated the Agency's obligation to cooperate with States.
"We believe in dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners," said EPA Chief Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPO's intention that ozone standards - which should be measured in part of the country in order to determine where cuts need to be made in order to meet stricter air quality standards - should be delayed by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, together with the district of Colombia, filed a complaint on Tuesday saying that the effort was illegal.
The government of President Donald Trump has tried to reverse a wide range of environmental challenges imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda to boost economic growth, according to Trump.
However, efforts have triggered the decline of democrats and nature conservation groups, which are concerned about the effects of larger emissions on public health.
The EPA website says that the inhalation of air that contains ozone "can reduce lung function and strengthen respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Community wants Community space
At the end of the decision, it was clear that the municipality of Fluorn-Winzeln decided to establish a Community space in the future of the elderly.
Before the discussion there is an important information: The purchase contract for the missing piece of property has been signed, says Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still take time for the church community to have its area in the community, there is no longer any planning obstacle for the project to be voted on by a private investor.
There is a debate on a Community area.
One of the two investors still on the boat offered to oppose the community.
On the ground floor, he would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipality insist that such a Community space should be provided not only as a meeting point for the inhabitants of the elderly living but also openly into the community.
For example, the word "strickcaffee" made the round.
The decision already taken by means of the provision of funds for the current budget in the past autumn will be undermined by the possibility of funding.
The building is located in the rehabilitation area.
The establishment of a Community area, as Tjaden reports, would be eligible for assistance by 60 % of 30 %.
The proposal provides for a decision to signal to the investor that in this regard it is not intended to put a gap between the legs, the statement that both satellites - what is dependent on environmental construction - and pull roof - which reduces the height of the dream and makes the construction more economical - would be possible.
Needless, so doesn't just mean Wilfried Sohmer, except for this supplement.
If it helps, he'll happen to the jury.
This is not so easy in the Community.
Daniela Call refers to many of her own buildings, with which one does not get so well, for which one now denies herself at the community room out of the window, she says, "I am hard at it."
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely talking about the Community space - however, absolutely against a municipal involvement.
It sees a covered subsidy on assets or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because the acquisition of the area does not provide any subsidy, but gives a genuine, marketable counter-value, in the event of doubt, says the opposite.
Three advocates are asked to split the draft decision accordingly.
In this way, two votes remain in the original programme, which Stefan Haller summarizes as follows: "If we take the decision this way, we will take a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure".
Collision with car: Wheeler is slammed on the street
On the crossing of the road, an 82-year-old biker was captured in Garath on Wednesday by a car and seriously injured.
As the police reported, the 82-year-long field was on its way by 12.20 p.m. with its bicycle on the black road from Hilden.
The senior wanted to cross the road along the road Am Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver driving in the same direction gave him priority.
When the field drove on the road, he apparently did not pay attention to road traffic.
He met with a car that controlled a 66-year-old Hildener.
The man was pushed onto the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a ambulance.
FC Bayern Munich must renounce David Alabama and Thiago in the supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The supercup takes place without it: David Alabama must let the game go against Dortmund.
With staff care, the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first time in the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the title defender in the supercup against the Pokal winner.
The staffing of the German football recordmaster Bayern Munich is increasing before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 / ZDF and Eurosport) at Pokalsier Borussia Dortmund.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must also give up David Alabama in the duel with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italians on Friday.
The Munichers Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are also missing.
For the five losses in the past six test games, Ancelotti made responsible for the physical state and the lack of balance in the game of his team.
"We know that we are not in the best physical constitution," said Ancelotti, adding: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
It wasn't good at all."
The 58-year-old, however, believes in an increase in performance in the first official game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The team's ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "hard, intensive game".
The duel of the two German football scores draws the fans into their banner.
The party was sold out with 81,360 spectators, the Deutsche Football Liga (DFL) announced on Friday.
Walking in the Harz of Stars to Stars
In the resin, the first "star path" is to be found in the nationwide.
This is planned by the association Star Warte Sankt Andreasberg.
A planetary path exists in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" comes to the need for information from many hard visitors, it was called.
It combines nature, science, movement and sports performance.
Members want to draw up the planned route tables and then inform them about stars and constellations.
In a first phase by 2018, the association plans to "reachable installations in five to six locations" in the Oberharz.
Inquiries come from St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeit and Sieber.
The information on the tables is to be added online.
For this reason, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the choice of location.
Freedom of movement is also a criterion.
The star path is to be extended later on by train.
"On the path of the stars, the viewers learn a great deal of knowledge, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association said.
They also learned why stars had different colors or why one star was brighter than another, even though it was far away.
It will also be reported which star is in a selected star and when it is best to see it.
The association has already been operating in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg since 2014.
The location in the centre of the National Park Harz is reportedly one of the six darkest regions in Germany.
From there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy are often visible with a mere eye.
In the city of Uni, there has been something similar to the planned constellation of Planetarium Göttingen – the planet path since 2003.
Starting at the Gebhards Hotel in the Goethealllee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planet path with its poles leads up to the Hainberg and to the Star Wart - as well as a "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden with the planet Sedna.
Steals with the individual planets - including the Pluto degraded to the planet at the end - are precisely in the range and scale of one to two billion.
The earth thus shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters diameter, while the exactly 75 meters sun still measures 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planet's path is good four kilometers.
While sunlight from sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to shop with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in the world.
The march to the next fast star, however, would take another half year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, to Garcia, the unbeatable World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion, the floor went down to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organisation Super Spring Weight Champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five Pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I wish you good luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the couple posted for photos, Lomachenko-Manager Egis noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of size".
"I am a former spring weight," Garcia recalled.
"I went up for Broner [on 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down on light weight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxes need this fight."
Climate asked whether it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title match in the forum on September 23.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans have asked for it," Garcia said and later said openly to fight with the network, which offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they're ready ..."
Garcia said he regards Lomachenko as "a huge fighter", and perhaps he will participate in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought he was looking at the three-fighting champion from Riverside "very slowly, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-out".
Garcia said the focus is to show strength, then box.
Both said they could feel the moment that was built up for their own struggle.
"This is the fight that must be carried out.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It'll be a great fight."
Four victims by tire seats
In the case of an A7 accident, four persons were injured in part on Thursday afternoon.
After first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at 4.30 p.m. shortly before the point of connection.
The car slid right into the forest, where it crossed and then lay on the roof in the green stripe.
The four insets - two adults and two children - were partially injured in the accident.
During the first supply of the victims by the rescue service, the A7 was blocked north for about an hour and then the traffic could be routed on the left lane at the crash site.
Fortunes Hoffmann: "Three-chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after 2:2 a season attack against Braunschweig that the optimization of defence formation will bring points to Aue.
With the first game of the season, Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result, would not have been the two opponents at 2:2 against Braunsweig.
"There were two opponents too many, and we need to be more careful in Aue," says the defense player of Fortune Düsseldorf.
In the Erzberge, the three-chain is also to be further optimized.
And a door after a break won't catch the fortunes anymore.
"For the future it will be so that no one will stand on the line next to Michael (Rensing)."
Hoffmann is convinced that even after the experience in preparing with the three-chain than with the four-chain.
"I still don't know how we're going to act in the eye," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his thing, "because we have players who can build well in the three-chain at half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann," said Hoffmann.
"It is a requirement, but that we harmonise even better and that we do not make so many playback errors in the construction."
Of course, Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game.
"If you can speak after an indecisive start, you don't know.
The performance could be quite ok," Hoffmann said.
"If we stand there on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the podium, we will certainly be able to talk about an orderly seasonal event."
His coach didn't want to know anything about it.
"The start of the season is only after six to eight days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage to the eye, just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be interrupted in advance because of a storm.
"Now they can start the season almost with a home game," Funkel and Hoffmann said that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher, as they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortune against a promotion in the bones.
"But they don't know 100 percent where they are right now," says the interior defender of Fortune.
Even though guests from the Rhineland go as a light favourite on Sunday to meet in the final (almost) stadium of Aue.
"That we remove them just because we have the claim to come under the first six is blödsinn," says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive in just one defeat against Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the second federal league that must be beaten from the outset," explains Fortunes Chefcoach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and excessive."
And so Funkel doesn't want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish Asylum Assessment Tests published
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which were subjected to a new method of medical evaluation of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years. But not everyone believes the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Jättsmedicinalverket) started the tests last year.
During the asylum procedure, they should make the assessment of the age more accurate after the Swedish Migration Authority (Emigration Convention) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were under-years.
To date, migration agencies have sent 6,880 to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in other 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "perhaps 18 or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the person is "perhaps under 18 years of age".
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been stable over the past few months.
"We don't see any big difference in the statistics of the last few months, the numbers are quite constant," he said in The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed as over 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that the asylum applicant has lied over his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases that "suggest that the investigated person is 18 years of age or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results published 581, she noted that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, when X-ray recordings of wisdom cells and MRI recordings of knee joints, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see whether they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
To judge the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure, we shouldn't do it as if we could," he said to the Metro newspaper.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of misjudgement of a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is that if the person is less than 18 then this is about 10 percent."
Fill in the Plan
The works on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are well ahead.
On Wednesday, a seven tons of heavy concrete was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We're very good at the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, construction director at the Department of Roads and Transport in the government presidency of Freiburg.
In April, the works started simultaneously on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The building is scheduled for October and it is easy to ensure that the timetable is met.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a concrete cobblestone bridge that is clothed with red blond sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, they have come into the years.
In order to ensure the stability and safety of transport, the three structures are now being thoroughly repaired.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They're made of red blond stone.
Both were built in 1939 and are 12 or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1,30 m wide on the north side on Wednesday morning and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.
This is a border fixation which is also used as an operating route.
On the south side of the bridge, a 2.20 meters wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday.
Then the pedestrian will walk.
The particular thing is that it is parts of the product, a patent by Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
The special feeling of fingertips has required the placement of wires through the construction in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a glass fibre cable that many companies are connected to.
The residents were informed in advance of the work by handbook about the project.
In addition, fish and crab had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the Assembly Hall in the direction of Schramberg, the traffic is regulated by a lamp.
For the construction of the bridge at the Lauterbacher Local entrance, the road in the area of the bridge is fully blocked at the height of the hotels "tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden".
The cost of the three bridge renovations totals EUR 700 000.
The whole country is financed.
AfD in Gerolstein: Gunter protest at German potato salad
It does not appear so often that parties are drawn to a string, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), what else is difficult to bring under a hat.
The parties represented in Kreistag Volcanoeifel (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, Left) are part of a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag on this day because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites to the poster "big election campaign campaign".
And well-known names begin - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland is the leading duo for the Federal Election on September 24th, and the Deputy Federal President Beatrix of Storch.
But those who are already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD students but demonstrate.
The word "The Eifel remains."
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at a table" on the well, but is now taking place in the parking lot below the rondell - and thus directly in the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
It's a colourful picture that's available.
And what Christa Karoli, president of the Forum A world and one of the important organizers, is quite happy: "Great how many people have come together here".
There is music and every amount of food, including a "urdish potato salad that the AfD could eat without any problem," says the woman who brought it.
The police have ordered many officers to go to Gerolstein, showing presence especially at the train station, which is just a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD actually get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes reported from the AfD Volcanoeefel, he has tried to make such an event and received the award.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first requested in Daun, but there was a discount because of the already built Laurentiusskirms there were not enough parking spaces.
So the rondell, Hopes is happy that "we can have such a nice event here."
In view of the event at the round hall he says: "That is the good right of people, the main thing, it remains peaceful".
It also does: At 8:00 p.m. on the round hall, there is a band for entertainment, in the city hall several speakers, including the Rhineland-Palestinian AfD President Uwe Young.
There are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the federal election, Alice Weidel, and the Deputy Federal President Beatrix of Storch to give their speech.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officers have had a quiet evening.
Just over an hour takes the AfD event, the guests on the front seat have a longer breath, but there is also an offer to clean up shortly after 21 hours.
The police can cancel - no special events.
Posaune meets Trumpet
A reunion with the Wolfic Posaunist Frederic Belli is held in the series of Haslacher Monaster concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 20 o'clock in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or "Balkanfolklore" also meets a classic German training with roots in music.
Both soloists are winners and prize winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top orchestras.
So is Petkov Solothrompeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is the Soloposaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both unite the desire not only to exceed the limits on their instruments, but also to merge the limits of the different genres.
Thus, Johann Sebastian Bach joins Bulgarian folklore with the two as in a new suit, Daniel Schnyders combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the play "Exchange Suite" of the Jazz Prize winner Nils Wogram, classics, jazz and the free play mix into a fascinating overall art.
This core part of the programme was only launched this spring with great success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher Monasterkirche with its special acoustics is consciously involved in the concert.
Christian Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything," says Christian Stewart openly about her bisexuality.
"If I ever bite in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh that was cool, what comes next?'."
The most well-known relationship of the Hollywood star was with her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who finally became bitter.
Despite all this, the brunt performer assures against the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was in love with every serious thing I've dated.
Or do you believe that I have played it?"
After her separation, Christians admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived and truly believed in dualism.
So it has never confused or hindered me.
I just never liked being taken seriously."
Especially under this, she said "Bang Showbiz" but in school when she preferred to dress like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I'd look like a bug.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think to me, 'Girl, be proud of you!'
In particular, the public does not like to explain their love: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and that upsets me.
And maybe some call me ungrateful, but I don't want to have to justify myself to the public."
The governor of West Virginia announces that he is changing the party
. The democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday afternoon at a announcement with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats are far from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and many thoughts ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer help you when I am a democratic governor."
The announcement broke out in jubel.
"In the morning I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rallye.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, according to Forbes of the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, on Thursday evening, the Republican National Committee issued a statement saying: "The change of party to Governor Justice is another blow for a democratic party that would rather prevent us from working to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governments and the control of the least legislative bodies in history, Governor Justice's announcement is only the last refusal of a party from top to bottom without leadership and unable to find a positive, some message," RNC President Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to the CBS News.
Coe commends "honest" Russian excuse for doping scandal
On Thursday, the world leader of light athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised what he described as a public apology from Russia as a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the time for the country to be admitted back to sport.
During the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships, Russia's Chief Athletics Chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said that his country's connection with sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all athletes who were stripped of gold and silver medals in competition".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress agreed to maintain the ban, which was binding in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found references to state-funded doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told the reporters.
"The whole Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized with itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."
Coe said he was also "rejoicing" that Russia accepted the criteria for his reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the time to use Russia again," Coe said.
"We have to do everything we can in the coming months to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the pure athletes from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will become neutral players in the light athletics world championships, which start in London on Friday, following the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for re-setting.
Drug tests are still insufficient and banned trainers are still free, he said reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
A sad act for soldiers who have fallen in Mali
At a mourning party in the northern Fritzlar, about 1,000 people thought of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the dom city under high security measures.
For yet unexplained reason, Defence Minister Ursula of the Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
She referred to the two dead pilots as "experts of their trade".
"We bow down to the highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Staff Chief of Northern Hessen were killed on Wednesday a week ago in West African Mali.
Their sorrows were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a death guard of the Federal Army in the Fritzlar Dom Sankt Peter on Thursday.
On the afternoon, only the members of the church were dismissed.
Afterwards, the celebration began in the family circle, close friends, representatives of the Federal Defence and politics.
Among these were Hessen's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Inspector General of the Federal Defence Volker Wieker.
Griefers laid down roses, the relatives stood arm in arm at the sorrows.
In front of the church Fritzlars and many soldiers persecuted the ceremony on a canvas wall.
The defense minister of Leyen called the deceased soldiers "highly decorated" and used experience.
The staff chief has built the flight operation of the Tiger fighter helicopter in Fritzlar and has been one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment.
Also Volker Bauersachs, the commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, said: "If this crew could not avert the riot, then no one would have failed."
No doubt about the UN mission in Mali, the minister of Leyen did not show: the use was dangerous.
But he is also of great importance "for a country from which we are only separated by two states," she said.
After the mourning party, the sorrows were brought out of the dome.
When and where they were occupied, the German army did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife.
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), will not be settled after his death with his wife.
This was shared by the royal house on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is attached to the Dom church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard has already produced a sarcophagus for both.
The Queen agreed with the decision of her husband, it was further stated in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried, be unclear.
However, he did not intend to be detained in his French home.
Prince Henrik never made a cure because he wasn't happy with his title.
After his wife Margrethe was enthroned in 1972, he would like to become king.
In 2016 he retired and also finished the title "Princess paint".
Since Henrik did not receive the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he did not consider himself equivalent to his wife - not even after death, Lene Balleby, the chief speaker of the Danish royal house, explained.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will be final, be still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be occupied in his French home, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he's worked for in the last 50 years.
The native Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French nobleman, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
On the theme he worked in the French Embassy.
During his later years, the people's sympathies always flew away, Prince Henrik, in his nearly 50-year regency with the Danes, had a difficult position.
In an autobiography, Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was swaying, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk drums instead of knitted socks, lemon instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises that I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the call here to be the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for surveillance.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed.
It was just two mistakes!"
Prime Minister Weil wants a quick re-election
CDU and FDP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony
In the Netherlands, Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is after the loss of the red-green government for a rapid re-election of the country day, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday he spoke for Parliament's resolution.
In the past, the surprising exit of a Green Member from her country group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the country election, the Red Green Coalition in Hanover lost its little majority vote in Parliament against the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The former Green-Deputy Elke Tweste founded her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she said on Friday in Hanover.
CDU Group Chief Björn Thumler wants to recommend to his group that they be included.
Thus, CDU and FDP together had 69 seats in the Low-Saxon Land Day, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new landday will be regularly chosen on 14 January next year.
Thümler said that the red-green government had to decide now whether it could continue to rule in this situation without a majority.
However, Stephan Weil considers it essential that the landday decides its own solution as quickly as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its follow-up on Tuesday.
The Constitution also provides for the possibility of the country day withdrawing trust from the Prime Minister and choosing a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These options need to be legally cleared," said Thümler.
"All questions will be discussed in peace if they are legally reasonable."
Thümler called the Twestens step "but something".
The politician himself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good."
She called herself a trailer of black green.
The Greens called on the retired Members to return their country day mandate.
"Of course, we assume that she returns her country day mandate, which she has received over the Green Country List, with immediate effect," said Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Korner.
The Group president of the Greens Anja Piel said: "We regret the decision of Elke Twest extremely".
You have deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the Group.
"Even in the light of the fact that there were no substantive differences, we cannot complete this step."
SPD chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the violation of the Dutch Green-Deputy Elke Twest as a traitor to the CDU.
"The behaviour of former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of voters, but also betrayal of Red Green," the Federal Chief of Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to re-elect the country day quickly.
The exit of the West costs the majority of Red Green in Lower Saxony.
The politician "in her hurt jealousy and in her cold personal interests before the good of the country", SPD General Secretary Hubertus Heil criticised.
"It's a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony co-operates with this dirty plot and tries to beat political capital."
Lower Saxony's CDU Group Chief Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his MPs that every West be admitted to the CDU.
The head of the SPD Group on the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, proposed to Twesten to falsify the outcome of the 2013 election with personal career memory.
At that time the CDU was the strongest force before the SPD, but the SPD and Greens had a deafening majority of a voice in the country.
Minister for Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from marriage, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing tested eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is speaking and responding in the interview with the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can the consumer protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look carefully at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print.
At the Consumer Protection Portal www.Libensmedikowarnung.de, the Federal countries submit the latest information on the eggs in question.
The eggs concerned should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to all we know at present, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Does Aldi now take over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the supply - because the central role of the educator by the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really being realized?
Food monitoring is the task of the Federal countries.
Nevertheless, my house has been immediately switched on and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since the introduction of the German interest.
All information and risk assessment are available to the consumer.
Trade, like manufacturers, has to ensure that the products sold are transportable and health-free.
If the maximum residue levels of 0,005 mg/kg are exceeded in eggs, they are not transportable.
Unloaded eggs, however, can be sold and consumed.
This time, the farms are not to blame.
Do production companies and consumers sit in the same boat?
According to the current level of knowledge, production companies do not incur direct debt.
Rather, they have to rely on economic damage due to allegedly illegal practices of service companies.
As always, there are too few inspectors.
Is there only a lack of staff or a lack of competence?
It was precisely the official controls that covered the process.
However, it is also true that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded to 100 percent.
That is why it is essential that such events be made clear in a consistent manner and that the referral to the public prosecutors in cases where criminal offences may occur.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect an inconsistencies from the responsible authorities.
Is regular alarmism really necessary in food scandals?
Consumers and consumers have the right to obtain safe and transportable food exclusively.
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers and consumers are rightly affected.
By means of sophisticated means, manufacturers, traders and consumers are placed in a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear: the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the treatment of food-supply animals is not acceptable and must be terminated without delay.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect from all the competent authorities that the case will be resolved promptly and without delay.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unimpeded expenditure of European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar's world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.
There will still be any consequences for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA because the leading organisation that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial Fair-Play Rules, which were launched in 2011 by UEFA, mean that PSG must at some time prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without significant losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's transfer to France.
PSG can certainly loosen the money to get Neymar to sign and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, in view of the funding of the team by the power-rich family of Qatar.
Associations may spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but they must counter with legitimate sources of revenue, allowing them the Break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that associations who had successfully incurred huge debts effectively and risked ruin when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP moved from concentration to the debts of the clubs to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher issue.
During the current three-year EFF installation period, which runs until 2018, Clubs can raise losses of EUR 30 million.
And although Platini 2015 has liked the presidency in Hungary, his UEFA successor, Alexander Ceferin, continues to advocate excessive spending.
"Surely FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, against The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid the purchase-out clause of Neymar in a pause, it can distribute the amount for the accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the redemption sum for the next five years can be set at EUR 44.4 million in the year's end.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has met with the most severe sanctions, together with Abu Dhabi, who is in the possession of Manchester City.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014/15 season championships remain limited to 21 players instead of the other normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that might try to overstate their financial supervision by increasing their revenues by companies that are connected with the owners of a club.
While a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsorship was to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this to be considered as legitimate income.
That is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of sponsoring the PSA was raised by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar on payments from the WM 2022 Organizational Committee.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar will become WM ambassadors and that such a manoeuvre could be easy to find out for UEFA regulators.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to comply with the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people who were familiar with the situation said on Thursday.
They spoke under the condition of anonymousity with The Associated Press, since they were not empowered to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16 with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million has achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million.
The accounts for the last financial year still need to be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, marketing and trikot sales.
The association assumes that the sales will increase by at least 30 per cent after the signature.
The Spanish League was clearly upset to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would harm the FFP.
"It's a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," said the president of La Liga, Javier Tebas, Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's final ownership of PSG.
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations against a state that funds a club.
"It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the whole of the football landscape over the past 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"As soon as a country has an association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the Financial Fairplay because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new Shoggil supplier
In recent years, Chocolate Frey has produced chocolate table chocolate for Switzerland.
Now the sweet cooperation is ahead of a possible end: the airline is rewriting the order.
Swiss spokesperson Meike Fuhlrott confirmed, at the request of the news agency, a corresponding report from the newspaper "Northwest Switzerland" on Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and subject to quality control.
"With the current supplier Chocolate Frey we are very happy," said the speaker.
Around 17 million small redboards packed to 14 grams each year distribute the air carrier before landing to the passengers.
On the costs, the Swiss did not want to make any statements.
Sector Insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwest Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros daughter achieves annual turnover of around one billion francs.
But more importantly, the advertising effect: For a Shoggi manufacturer it is a prestigious job.
As many applicants are present in the new invitation to tender, the Swiss do not want to betray.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are in question.
According to the newspaper, Chocolate Frey wants to try to renew the Spring 2018 Treaty.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate producer was not available for an opinion.
The Swiss has distributed chocolate tables on board its flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with Migro's daughter, Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug.
The possibility of placing the logo was introduced by Switzerland two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with chocolate Frey.
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-distance flights, customers of the First Class are decorated with confectionery Sprüngli, in which Business Class swim passengers Schoggi from Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolate Frey.
Also on the short course Swiss Schoggi distributes chocolate Frey, both in business and in the economy class.
Easy Athletes - Discus-Olympiasier Robert Harting achieves WM-Finale
The three-time world champion fights for a medal on Saturday in the final.
His brother Christoph, the 2016 Olympic winner, was a failure in the national WM decision and could only watch the discus competition from the Tribune.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who cast 65.13 metres far, qualified for the final battle.
Nostalgia goes to "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" in the Niches
This repetition of history is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s-year-grunge era (as the predecessors David Wain and Michael Shawalter turned the Sketch comedy "The State" for MTV) and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is likewise a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a Franchise, it feels like the time would be short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it includes an original story for a talking dose of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By strutting on the core of the gags - middle-aged actors play cute children who will grow up - they still managed to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody goes more according to the caste cannon principle, including a riff on the stalker films of the 1990s such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand That Shakes the Wave").
At one point an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a series of other things from 1991" stifle a character.
Many of the central stories are the same.
The loving Coop (Mr. Shawalter), now Roman author, has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau) yet.
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy evil plot involved in Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a successful impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It is particularly fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, the Matt Dillon's underlingable of "Singles", whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old knocker.
It is the moments of random madness that could warm up this franchise like a kind of recurring "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I consider to be its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the band how she will visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now reminds of another kind of nostalgia: the revitalization of the Cold War of "The Americans", the movie "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-West Rinkamp iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director suggests a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two police officers as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-assed Gregor and an idealist Joseph - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelius Ulici, whose dialogues by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are synchronized in English.
It's a great idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on TV, how Americans might do it with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - ensures a proper game 'Find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truth of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer who wears a Reagan mask - that it often plays as one.
In six long episodes, it goes there, and the comedy is not fast enough or often enough.
"Comrade Detective", who was edited for a shorter time, could deliver his Agitprop satires better, as Gregor and Joseph are constantly visiting the American message, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who swallow a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imaginary communist public is that Western culture can make everything up to feed for a settlement.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we do it even with our own younger history and with their own.
Fighting drugs mafia in the country
The police beat the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning many objects were searched in the Black Forest-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the state prosecutor Konstanz announced on Friday.
15 defendants between 25 and 77 years of age were arrested and already issued arrest warrants against them.
In addition, officials secured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
At the same time, two persons were arrested in Italy.
Against the two suspects, there were German arrest warrants.
The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
A total of over 300 police officers were involved.
The members of the Mafia are subjected to organised drug crime, serious rape, attempted murder and robbery and repression.
Since the summer of 2016, the State Prosecutor's Office has determined Konstanz against organised drug trafficking in the south of Germany.
Between the state courts in Constantz and Palermo there was a real exchange and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the large deployment was also accompanied by four Palermo officials on Wednesday morning.
In particular, Italian nationals with a close relationship to the Italian Mafia entered the scope of the investigations.
Another incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired early in the morning in a guesthouse, was to go to the gang's account.
Way to complain about large gaps in the foreign register
"Data of citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the foreign registry in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to partly gravitational failure in asylum procedures.
The Commissioner for Refugee Management of the Federal Government, Frank-Jürgen way, has made a media report on large gaps in the foreign central register.
Failures in the data registered there could lead to "partially serious failure" in asylum procedures and removals, warned in an analysis available in the "South German newspaper".
According to the data, ten million people with foreign nationality are included in the register, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data are therefore managed by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data has not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality has not been good in parts so far.
In individual cases data were found from 1921, "from people who are no longer alive for a long time, or from citizens who have become German citizens and who should not actually appear in the register anymore".
"Failible data inputs can significantly slow down the return processes," the report continues.
In addition, EU citizens are included in the exit statistics, who should not even leave.
However, such misappropriation led "to a distorted debate about the treatment of exit officials", says the analysis.
In the meantime, the Federal Government has apparently begun to send refugee families with children under 16 years of age back to Italy once they have moved there.
This is reflected in an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung".
Thus, the paper states that BAMF has been conducting such procedures "for families with children - with the exception of infants and young children - to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, it has practically ceased to be possible, so the newspaper refers to the difficult situation on the site.
Under the Dublin Agreement, EU refugees are responsible for the first to reach.
If a migrant continues to travel to another EU country, this State may send him back to the country of arrival.
For this reason, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the capacity of families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly".
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (EGMR) considers these commitments sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
The national spokesperson for the Left Group on the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticised this decision: "Familys with children are threatened by the lack of human rights reception in the Italian asylum system and a danger to the welfare of children".
Second best results
A total of 220 liters of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach has already made the blood donation service available to others.
At least 12 citizens who were awarded a prize on Friday.
All in front of Jürgen Greule, who shared 50 litres of blood with his present 100 donations.
Traditionally, the community at the meeting of the municipality deserves the repeated willingness to donate blood.
"It's great how our body is designed for this, and we pay tribute to the donors who provide their blood for strangers, even useless," stressed Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single donation of blood helps several people," explained the circuit manager of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the cans are placed in their components.
That way, three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maidenbach reported on the actions carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
"In this year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRK-Chairman.
Apparently, the change in theatre has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago.
Already, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the many donors and were awarded 50 blood donations for each.
Half so many booked Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pprommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter delivered ten times every 500 millilitres of her lifetime.
The Bank of England will maintain interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to be announced later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculations over an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "slight" when it maintains interest rates on family income in the middle of increasing pressure.
The Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) political decision-makers agreed to keep interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members seeking an increase this month, as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the pressure on budgetary revenues would continue, with inflation likely to increase to almost 3% in the fall.
But she pointed out that in the coming years, interest increases would be necessary to reduce Brexit's-heated inflation and said that the credit costs might have to increase more than expected in the financial markets.
Members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mammut Circumstance Package issued a year ago after the Brexit.
It will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February, although it has been said that it is now expected to make 15 billion pounds more available within this system - with 115 billion pounds Sterling.
Minutes after the interest rate decision, the Bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on real household income continues to burden consumption."
At the interest rates, she reiterated that "a certain penalty of monetary policy" for defrosting inflation and a "something larger" extent would be necessary than expected from the markets.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "step by step" and "limited".
The bank's growth forecasts adjusted below for this year and next year are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% projected in May.
It maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after this news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and fell by 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision will not change once the most recent disappointing growth rates have slowed up expectations to an increase in interest and GDP has risen from 0.2% in the second quarter of the previous three months to 0.3%.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will be easily recovered by the end of the year after the bank.
The recent inflation report has offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and low-quality increases, as the increase is getting worse before it then improves.
She added that in the coming years monetary policy cannot "stop" the income gap, but she added that the wages would be "clear" at the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak weight, which will compensate some of the lower consumption costs.
The decision will come one year after the interest rate has been reduced to 0.25% in the last August following the shocking EU vote that led to the fund's downturn.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to fully reach prices and the economy.
Prior to the bank's last judgment on interest rates, inflation has increased after an increase in interest rates, as inflation has increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three political decision-makers demanding an increase of 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% in June to 2.6% last month, although the bank said it was expected and will attract it again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the overrun in relation to its target of 2 % was "full" to attribute to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent drop in swap rates, the mortgage market should become more competitive, as creditors are looking for business louder and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those who run out of existing deals and close the new mortgages, and many with free options and low rates are becoming popular."
NHS (National Health Service) is intended to prescribe controversial HIV drugs 10,000 people
From September, patients will be given access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the drug in the NHS.
NHS England reported that a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) that can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by about 86 percent is now being delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.
He declared himself willing to finance the proceedings after the Court of Appeal had confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court last year that the NHS had the power to pay for the PreEP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England-Chief Simon Stevens as "important new intervention", while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) called it "a decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to be able to register people, and further clinics will be followed in October before it is introduced into all of England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PreEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV in people at risk of infection.
Taking PreEP before sex means that just enough medicines are available in a person’s body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken every day or two hours before sex.
Among those who are in need of treatment are gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and persons with HIV-positive partners who have not been treated successfully.
In clinics, appropriate participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not adequately controlled by antiretroviral therapy.
People living in England and registered with a home doctor can also sign up for participation in their local sexual clinic.
The programme will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract for the supply of medicines this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study should assess the full potential of PreEP by collecting clinical evidence, how it is targeted, recorded and implemented in a large scale.
Stevens said: "This great new intervention should complement and overcome the extensive and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the ongoing progress of more than three decades in addressing one of mankind's biggest health challenges."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PreEP, when targeted at people who are in need and at risk, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September on, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, which leads to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgin's Trust, said: "The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV will be left behind.
Now that PreEP testing medicine has been obtained, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, shadow minister of health, said: "The start of the pre-EP process is welcome and overwhelming after months of delays and slow implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and the transmission of this life-changing infection can end.
This attempt will bring us a step closer to understanding the advantages of PreEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV-infected and that it will help to bring us closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society.'
The big life: Between the shot and the smarter designer tricks these little Earls Court apartment have turned into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, declined from a large house in Knightsbridge in 2014 to an Earls Court Apartment.
It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof for the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high decks.
I fell in love with her and made an offer this day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely over-obtained.
Originally a one-room property with a vaulted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage room and an intermediate gun to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my request," she says.
To this end, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The deck was not large enough to place two rooms together, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate bulkhead in which one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the default.
"The steelworks are quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked together, without having to break.
It was not just about building a simple platform, but about putting the steel so that it had the right height for the function up or down."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with much additional drama.
For the intermediate bulkhead, a classic copper light window of retrovisus looks down over the glamorous residential area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.
At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.
In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window in another room.
Mirrored units at the entrance provide space for all items and glasses by Joanne.
By observing a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
The particular thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went in there," explains Erfan from the reinforced, furnished MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so when you lift the door, it's very easy to climb."
Thanks to the clever use of room and storage room, Joanne was able to win an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate maker will enter and a calculation will be carried out based on the floor size."
Here they have managed to expand the surface and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things that touch you and thus help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical plugs in the walls.
These are important, but they do not play with your heart."
It shows that an apartment can be transformed into something completely amazing by good design and increased square meters of something standard.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave this.
Brothers fight for a 500 million US dollars real estate empire
Two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in a dispute over one of the largest real estate empires in Victoria worth over $500 million.
The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul. He brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how his property and business assets should be divided.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over separation took place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars, since the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There the family founded Westco Jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail shops.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the capital.
After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as "main operator and dominant personality" in the family De Lutis - has about two-thirds of the company's assets and about one-third by Paul.
A court record says that this means that Colin owns property in the value of $316 million and Paul in the value of $176 million.
The division of property and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
The first hearing of the Supreme Court took place on Friday following a number of failed submissions.
The brothers are now also fighting to control the existing business - from which Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but Paul proposes to manage some possessions incompetently.
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to join the dispute.
"My Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs increase, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and lawyers' offices held on both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants, who operated milk bars and delicate shops in the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property, in which Colin opened the first Jeans Store of the family.
Colin says that he started there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to give their property to their sons kindly.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Group, while Colin claims that Mark was paid $10 million when the company left and Luke 26 million.
Both Luke and Mark are, Paul says, "the conditions of their financial separation have become bitter."
Colin stayed very much behind, although he was a former member of the AFL board and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied by SMS to say, "I really can't say much," because the case is before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to complain to me and draw our family names through the courts," he wrote.
In a letter to the court in mid-2016, Colin wrote that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father wouldn't have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he "still hopes for a solution."
On Friday, this hope seemed to be over.
"Our case will be resolved in the near future by the courts," Colin wrote.
Trump's new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the President's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If he does, he'll be the first.
Politicico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including the reports of the media, in the hope of keeping the head at a more balanced course.
Here's a piece by reporter Josh Dawson:
"As John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with leading employees on his first working day, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that entered the president's hands.
Kelly told the employees that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the President would make better decisions if he received good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to beat Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship to television is enough for decades - and now that he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"When candidate Trump was upset by an unfair report, it was productive to show him that he received a fair report from the authorities who were to be convinced," said former electoral councillor Sam Nunberg in February against Politico.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former election officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption contains a constant praise price."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we don't know about others - that Trump Tweets had even more firearms without their intervention.
We'll probably never find out anything about the tweets that Trump didn't send.
If his employees have managed to keep him away from him a few times, their efforts have been rewarded.
But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a white house, composed of competing parties, are always trying to put forward their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world.
Politicalo - completely occupied with this story - reported in May on the Council's preference to provide the President with questionable information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmaker:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he can figure out where they come from.
That is exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of Internet Provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a pile of Lecks" in the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter because of Shikans or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has in the past made false representations and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began to ask employees about Walsh."
Goldmaker added that the then Chief of Staff Renice Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper kram that received the Trump".
How'd it go?
Kelly's trying to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself more effective as a Priebus manager, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most sought-after criminals receive Europol's mail
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population will be sought and hoped.
This summer, the police throughout Europe send postcards to dangerous criminals on the run.
Since the addresses of the sought offenders are not known naturally, references from the population are expected and sought.
On Friday, Europol reported on the action that follows the "EU Most Wanted" Advent Calendar from winter.
The experience had shown that many refugees were hiding from holiday destinations, it was called Europol.
21 postcards have been compiled for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016 the website www.eumosvanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online searches could be arrested so far, at least 11 of them due to references after publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate about a grave and return to 'Millionaires-Series'
Some of the most prosperous houseowners of the West Midlands are again with some determined travelers on foot on war, who have negotiated a graves drawn by the community to return a field to their masters.
Travelers parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull called the "Millionaires Series".
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters only after they were thrown out in May, but without having to be intimidated by a tomb dug by the Council to prevent their deposits.
The tactical group found a hole in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Angry residents have harassed the Council of Solihull, who said it was "useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said, "They went there on Monday night after they were sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at the passengers.
The Council must be forced into action by shame to implement it, since it was useless when dealing with the problem.
Travelers were there in May, moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably even more today."
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long teaching to protect its parks.
I live on the Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my municipal tax if the Council cannot even stop that."
A resident who did not want to be mentioned said: "It is ridiculous, we have just seen the last round of these travelers only to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you've even seen a horse in the parking area."
A spokesperson for Solihull's Council said: "We have an unauthorized camp on the ground outside the Streetsbrook Road and work with Solihull's police. We take the necessary legal steps to ensure that they move on as quickly as possible.
To support our evidence collection, it is very important that as many people as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court has to examine when we present our case."
From Birkenhof will be Waldhotel Luise
From the former Birkenhof Hotel, the Forest Hotel will be Luise.
The house before the gates of Freudenstadt is being renovated and is to be reopened on 1 March next year.
That's good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the Birkenhof Hotel by the then Ambience Business Company mbH on 13 April 2014, about 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also received by the Courtesy.
In the fall of 2014, in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees who came into the countryside, the hotel building was offered to the Land Council as a collection accommodation, which led to controversial discussions.
The city prevented asylum seekers from staying by establishing a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not undisputed in the municipality at the time.
But above all, the mayor of Freudenstadt, Julian Osswald, defended the hotel location and spoke of the growing interest in the house.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels group with Managing Director Birgit Scherer with a seat in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Birkenhof Hotel in a voluntary sale in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three-star plus category named Waldhotel Louise.
The group has four houses with the city of Freudenstadt.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Park Hotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof there have been construction containers for a long time before the entrance, and when you enter the house, it will be clear what extensive renovation works are being carried out.
The floors were cut out, decks were partly decomposed, old bathrooms away from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building.
There's still a lot to do by March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in a conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renovated in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large removable showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are built.
Everything is to be "beautiful" later, as Thomas Scherer expressed himself.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment.
You do not want to be placed on the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already on a high level of downtown level, Scherer stresses.
The forest hotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to be spacious, Scherer further explains.
Both holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel well at the hotel.
Talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause have already taken place, says Scherer.
The city's performances are similar to those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
Asked for the amount of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine exactly.
Just under a million euros, he's counting.
The external facilities are also brought to the fore, which is already visible.
In an indoor courtyard there is a large terrace that will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia affair: US Special Agent sets up Grand Jury
In Russia's affairs about US President Donald Trump, Special Envoy Robert Mueller is supposed to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report.
In the past few weeks, the board took up the work, wrote the Wall Street Journal, calling on people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper assessed the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified his investigations.
The broadcaster CNN reported that there were already first submissions by the board in connection with a meeting between Trump's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence has been accusing the Kremlin for a long time of targeted involvement in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there was an agreement between Trump's electoral team and Moscow.
The focus of the investigations should be on several men who acted as advisors to the Republican elections.
According to reports, Mueller also took more and more Trump's private and business environment under the lupe.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special envoy Trump had personally moved into the centre and examined the case whether the president might have impeded justice during the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine and decide whether to prosecute the present evidence in possible criminal cases.
The Grand Jurys are therefore also called prosecution chambers.
They are usually activated when it comes to larger and controversial cases.
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.
The Board may also be activated by the Public Prosecutor's Office to invite persons to be admitted under oath.
According to the broadcaster CNN, tenders have already been issued which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
The report invited the participants to make a statement.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then elected leader Paul Manafort were also at the conversation.
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on U.S. television that the introduction shows that Mueller does not allow himself to be intimidated in his work and that he wants to act quickly, if necessary.
However, it should not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be activated at the end to decide on the prosecution.
However, the establishment of the board of inquiry was a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new revelations, on Thursday afternoon, the President used a speech in West Virginia to represent Russia's affairs as a campaign of his political opponents.
"The history of Russia is a total invention," Trump said.
The topic gives the Democrats an opportunity to "seel good because they have nothing else they can talk about".
His Special Adviser Ty Cobb stated in an opinion that he knew nothing about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
But they also usually work in secret, he stressed.
The White House is in favour of any measures that have accelerated the work of the Special Agent in a "fair" way.
Former FBI chief James Comey said three times that it would not be determined against the president.
There is no reason to believe that something has changed, it was stated in the statement.
But Mueller was only used after Trump Comey had fired.
As a result of this draft had been rejected against Trump, he wanted to prevent justice.
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop the investigations against the then national security consultant Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure from the investigation.
After presenting U.S. media, the White House collected material against the Special Agent and his employees.
It solves speculation about whether Trump Mueller wants to be released.
Unlike an independent congressional mediator, such as in the Watergate affair about the late President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the pressure of the president by the Ministry of Justice.
But several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.
On Thursday, two groups of Republican and democratic senators presented draft laws that could no longer be dismissed by the special prosecutor.
Antarctica: Giant Iceberg Drives in the Antarctic
In the Western Antarctic, a giant iceberg has dissolved from the almost seven-fold size of Berlin from the Shelfeis.
This was shared by the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The over one trillion tons and 5800 square kilometers of colossus now travels north and will probably take two, three years until it melts.
It is 175 kilometers long and up to 50 kilometers wide one of the largest ice giants that researchers have recorded in the past three decades.
A danger to humans does not come from him.
As far as climate change has played a role in the break-up of the iceberg, it is unclear according to researchers.
Overall, however, for about 30 years there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice pellets in the region, writes the U.S. Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be associated with global warming.
The colossus now broken was still part of the Larsen-C-Shelfeis.
Chelsea swims on the sea and is eaten by large glaciers.
It therefore continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C-Shelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.
In the north of this cesspool, the balance of growth and setbacks was disrupted a few years ago.
A complete shellfish was destroyed there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is some indication that the Larsen-C-Shelfei is in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it is currently.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can collapse if a piece breaks at a key spot.
Melting shale and iceberg does not increase the sea level since it swims on water and the ice swallows as much water as it does after melting itself.
However, the loss of the shellfish results in glaciers directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.
This could possibly increase the sea level, but only to a small extent, the British research project on the observation of the Antarctic (Midas) writes.
The Larsen-C-Shelfeis is, according to AWI, the fourth largest shelf of the Antarctic with nearly 50,000 square kilometres.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
That's where it breaks down regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from British Swansea University.
"This is the most extensive withdrawal since the beginning of the recording," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it was disputed whether the Larsen-C-Shelfei would grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Even though these researchers do not bring the destruction of this giant iceberg into the climate change, many ice pellets of the Antarctic peninsula have been destroyed in recent decades.
This long summit of the Antarctic extends towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Arctic peninsula's ice surface has fallen by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s.
The decrease has contributed to the rise in temperature.
In the past 50 years, the Antarctic peninsula has warmed up by about three degrees and is thus one of the fastest-growing areas of temperature.
CDU wants home tariff for staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy new jobs, the CDU asks to leave the employers' association to become more attractive.
Only shortly before the summer break did the Krestag 41 new posts in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the circuit administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 trainees have their first working day behind them.
The teaching sites around the circle are obviously very desirable.
Around 620 applications were to be registered for the seats to be forgiven this year.
However, the circle still lacks staff to meet the increased requirements and tasks.
Currently there are still 50 uninhabited places in the Mettmann district.
These include doctors and engineers as well as the powers of general administration.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG during the crisis and to address the lack of expertise in the administration.
The administration shall, at the request of the parties, develop "a concept for the acquisition and development of personnel".
The aim is not only to meet the short-term needs of professionals but also to address the applicant’s shortage in the future.
The overall concept should be oriented inwards and outwards, concrete measures for cleaners and include training offensives, calling for CDU, FDP and UWG.
This is already true after a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn't know before.
Other cities hire good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The speech is from a regular competition of public employers.
In addition, a large number of staff are separated from the service by sickness or old age.
So maximum time to act so that no more jobs remain unoccupied.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, the head of the CDU Group, goes beyond the joint request with his party.
He had recently made a big surprise in the Krestag when he publicly questioned the cost of staffing and surprised the other parties.
Peoples want all possibilities to be reviewed to allow for an exit from the municipal employers' association.
"If we do not come here in the short term to a satisfactory solution, the circuit management should seek a domestic tariff with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the surrounding cities -," said Peoples.
Thus the CDU tries to pay employees and officials better than it actually provides for the tariff provision for the public service.
The fees are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you switch to a higher level, which is oriented to years of work.
But the tasks of the circle have been growing ever more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up, where employees took care of the provisions of the new Prostitutional Protection Act.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Henle and Circuit Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Italy sharpens the sound of NGOs migrants rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs that the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean should not continue this if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis Warning came one day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German aid organization 'Youth Rescuet' because their team had worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to make detailed submissions by the Italian State Attorney Ambrogio Cartosio.
"It is for us and the salvation of human life remains our top priority. So we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organization said in an opinion on the social media.
"We can only assess all the charges currently raised after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Youth Rescuet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that its crew will be carrying tube boat migrants that are delivered directly to them by human traffickers and that smugglers can leave so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting was reportedly only 1.3 miles ahead of the Libyan coast, according to the State Prosecutor's Act, the content of which was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of being removed from the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue forces in the area for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reason.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board who is monitoring their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue efforts have so far declared themselves ready to stick to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Active Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring with them "substantial changes or disabilities" of their rescue actions.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize-winning organization is doctors without limits (MSF).
Minniti now said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue measures in Italy had declined sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperate with local mayors have borne fruit.
"In the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hopes of reaching Europe.
Increases and Trials
Nine Weiler bikers, the "Berliner Outternposten" and two guests met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy trials and sightseeings for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
Wachenheim's castle and wine festival was a welcome extra.
The first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Michaelcapelle above Deidesheim.
There were views, partly on towers, from which you could look far over the Pfalzer forest and the pre-storey plains.
In the meantime, there have been ever-increasing increases for which long trials have been rewarded.
On the second day it went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the Wurstmarkt folk festival.
Again, the perspective was chosen, coupled with "float" trials and moderate increases.
In the last two days, many altitudes have been reported again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and cabins brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim the bikers breathed in the sun healing in the open air.
Neustadt was also sent.
After 173 kilometers and nearly 4,500 meters high, the group had known the Pfälzer Forest from its best side - sports and culturally.
Console instead of race - Bundesliga equips for e-sport
Are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future, instead of fighting over the stadium terraces with wind and weather?
The fact is: E-Sport has long been a serious business, has become a lucid business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gags.
This has also been recognized by the first German Länder which are increasingly engaged in this area.
At the beginning of 2015, the VfL Wolfsburg, later followed the FC Schalke 04 and lastly the VfB Stuttgart, which founded an E-Sport department in mid-July and took two professions for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract.
"We hope to inspire a whole new target group for the VfB," says the Board of Directors Jochen Rötgermann.
He's sure "that there are still a few associations on this train".
On the coming weekend, the FIFA World Football Association in London organises the first "Interactive Club World Cup", where the players of various clubs compete with each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"The real football has to deal with the 14-30-year-olds in particular, that young people are still going to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The associations tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asians.
With prominent e-sporters under contract, you could be present online much more often on these markets than sending the federal league to Asia only once a year.
What's going on?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or just the FIFA football simulation are competed out.
For the longest time, as in normal sports, they have established beds in which the professions compete with each other.
And in the Asian Games 2022 E-Sport is already part of the official program.
But is this a good sport at all?
For many, the idea is certainly habitual.
Ingo Froböse has also been discussing the issue for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classical sports - such as increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding and rapid response.
Professional gamers should train not only on the console but also on their body and pay attention to the diet.
"The fitter is a good player."
But Froböse also sees problems: "Doping will become more and more a topic".
Controls are difficult to perform in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing.
Positively, the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sport.
The players are on the international road, which is like a large global family, where there are no intercultural barriers.
A study of the company consulting Deloitte and the Federal Association Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsoring and major tournaments.
In three years the turnover will be 130 million.
Against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the federal football league, this is not the case.
However, the E-Sport is "not far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey", the Deloitte advisors write.
Many other countries are already international.
Large markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-Basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the U.S. Team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport betting provider Unikrn.
In Europe too, some things happen.
In a Norwegian school, E-Sport was introduced as a teaching school, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, the football first-time clubs, according to Dutt, are currently obliged to set up an e-sport department.
"In the European comparison Germany is looking back," explains VfB CEO Rötgermann.
Just falling into nostalgia and explaining the old times is not enough today.
It is about preserving the tradition of the Union, but at the same time setting the company up on the modern market.
"We live in a digitised world," says Dutt.
"There's no way you can stop it from just staying at football as it always was."
Poison egg ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
From the scandal around poisoned eggs, most of the countries are now affected.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have responded and have taken all eggs from the sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that do not contain fipronil are to be taken into the regale.
Michelle Carter condemned for the texts that Conrad Roy urged to commit suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and have been put on trial for five years.
Carter was convicted in June of the fatal murder of Conrad Roy, who died on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father said on Thursday at the hearing: "My family is anxious.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free until the call.
She had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr. Roy had suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a creamy blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and down her eyes when she was condemned.
"Your actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended her life to make her own.
She took no responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show any remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a terrible circumstance that she totally regretted".
Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, that he did not find that her "age or maturity or even her mental illness have a significant influence on her actions".
A state attorney read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy, who said that there is "no day on which I do not regret the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there despite all my pain that we will bear with us forever," it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she would be "followed" by the realization that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother's brother or be an aunt for his children.
"No longer having this one person with whom I have been with since my birth every day is a pain that I will always be kept with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to be a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to urge another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy died of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hand yourself up, jump from a building, start yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention through Roy's death and ordered that she benefit from the case through some press.
The case has shared the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter were Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michaelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-lahm of the FC Bayern
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run at the Audi Cup as a captain is not an accident.
The FC Bayern brings a great season to confed-Cup winner - Extra motivation doesn't hurt there.
Something else was there in his seat in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich saw immediately, even though the extra clothing was very, very small.
But on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, there was no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer to see, he was holding on to his arm.
"The coach didn't announce it," said the confed-Cup winner later, after his first use as a Bavarian captain.
Well, the entity could have run better than at 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But Kimmich was able to show the sign of the coach.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal was selected as the leader of the C-Elf from youth players, debutants and just from the professional vacation.
Zuckerl is the most popular to be distributed to those who are very trusted who want to keep at Laune.
So whoever has been chosen to join the legacy of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation well.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: take responsibility".
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old ran over the field as a mini-lahm.
Right back, that's his position now, the white tie on her arm did the rest.
And at all, Kimmich acted in this initial formation like the one that can take the rudder the best.
He gave instructions, tried to link the unplayed troops.
He had the full look, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal in order to overcome his lack of fitness ( hardly fit); Renato Sanches in order to join the Devil in the performances of the Asian travels (only conditional); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle in order not to appear negative in their first appearance in the Bavarian trikto.
That was a good thing, though.
Süle followed Kimmich, Rudy before the defense, both acting sovereignly.
The notorious Napoli storm often made itself difficult, and also tried to make it a success a few times in the game.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result "was not as we expected it to be".
But he also showed a good performance at debut.
Game movement, temp change: "For this style I was also picked up".
As unusual as this Bavarian world is still for the new accesses, you saw the party as a result.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich adopted a few sloppy statements in the back of his new player.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "What's going on here, I've already noticed.
In Bayern you just have to win every game."
However, he doesn't have to contribute to the new.
Alabama Motivates ÖFB Women
David Alabama believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's best-known footballer just before the game went on Twitter and the ÖFB lady wanted everything good.
The Bavarian Legionary is a close-to-club colleague of ÖFB-Captain Schnaderbeck with our Lady.
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and the Champions League winner should be a special motivational shot.
The famous Bayern dussel might need our ladies as well.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economy praises Wissing Tempo
The relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Evelyn Lemke (Green) was still the Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate, was often inconsistencies.
This is demonstrated after more than one year, in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T-V's request for a change in economic policy and at the same time pay tribute to the old minister.
Frank Natus, president of the Association of Triering Companies (VTU), says: "Wissing addresses the desires of the economy that Lemke has blocked everything".
The biggest turning point is seen in Natus' infrastructure policy: the gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now in the country's priority list.
This year, the Ministry hopes that a plan will be established until 2021.
A role in the country's plans is also played by the West Bank Trier, which is in the urgent need of the Federal Roadmap.
The aim is to take the route into operation in December 2020, Minister of State spokesperson Cornelia Holtmann says.
Natus sees a guide to support regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier seeks, as Wissing urges, to label a Rhineland Pfalz label in wine to increase the paragraph in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have been declining for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company, the IHK praises.
The Handicraft Chamber Trier sees in the new Master Bonus an additional incentive for young trainers, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A prize of 1000 euros for the existing Master's examination and 2500 euros is foreseen if graduates become independent within ten years of the Master's training.
However, the household task list for the country remains long.
The planned road construction was quick to create facts, while the country lacks the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, chief businessman of the IHK Trier.
Of the 56 new engineers who want to set up knowledge in the country's mobility business, only 29 jobs have been occupied.
The IHK calls for more orders to external offices.
The CDU Group's Christian Baldauuf refers to the calculations of the Court of Auditors, the country invests in 2017 and 2018 more than €20 million less in the acquisition of national roads than is proposed.
Frank Natus also expects another concept of the country, as it wants to address the lack of expertise in the region.
It is also exciting to see the previous expansion of broadband in the country.
In 2016, regional companies had assessed the network supply in an IHK survey only with Note 3.4.
They complain about lingering internet connections and interruptions.
On the other hand, former Minister of Economy Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and is still in the board of supervisors of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where after four months she had already cleared the field for inconsistencies.
Audi to change 850,000 Diesel vehicles - Car manufacturers face a counter-reaction
One day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The president of the BMW said that the company was of the opinion that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", thus referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the companies as revocations.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emission rules.
But the stick oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The costs for car manufacturers to install installations for the neutralisation of exhaust emissions from diesel vehicles also admit what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
The German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with hating the powerful auto companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen which could regulate the use of so-called shutdown devices to comply with the rules when a car was tested, but to return to normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several employees of Volkswagen were accused, others being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be tried in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to deal with emission regulations in Europe, and an application focused on the United States was extended.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could be difficult for Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen.
This message has the river on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order to join the Isar visitors too, on Saturday morning a river runs through Munich, which has a special message.
If it moves again to Isar on Saturday, it will see a great river between the river and the riverbank.
And this is not a regular river, with Isar tourists.
Especially the construction press wants to clear up.
On the river you can see a great info-transparency.
It shows a Müllberg.
The opening of a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True Love Is ..." the understanding for the Isar should be strengthened as a protective wild flow.
Last summer, the Izar River has flown, and this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmental awareness.
Mordillaless Knuckle Nausea and Laughing Against Suffering
Mordillo was currently one of the most published cartoon characters, the knuckle noses of his figures are his trademarks.
With 85, the Argentine is still drawing and working on a film.
His message: Laugh, "for there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, among other things, he worked as a painter for happiness cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he reached the end of the 60s of the break: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in the "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, round Mordillo figures are immersed in drawings with the ship Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own statement, he is still at the signatory today, working almost ten hours daily.
About calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, T-shirts, pets and watches, his wonderful figures continue to find a great deal of distribution around the world.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures.
The main person in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - the most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand footman as an opponent.
For the first time, his figures are in the 3D film to come to the cinema wall in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're gonna say, it's weird for me," says Mordillo.
The scroll is not written by him.
That is why he focuses on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced without value.
lavender from the Provence of Climate Change threatens
He has become a symbol of the Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is reversible due to the conditions of drought and the insects that transmit diseases, which scientists and farmers try to find solutions to great headaches.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the fall.
This has an impact on the life span of Lavender.
There is also a small zikade, a microbacterial that transmits zigzade, and in very dry weather there are many of them."
And it's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil attracts not only for vacationers, it is also very asked for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weak.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
The solutions taken into account include a better distribution of water and slowing down the digestion from the soil, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of tuna and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhône celebrates today its 1200-year-old existence.
This Saturday and Sunday is the highlight of a medieval festival.
Kremmer, fives, dealers, wagonmen or a country servant camp are supposed to be in the city center on these days.
The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The Riodoce weekly staff usually meet in the middle of the week to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedies, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it was important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, which in 2009 was the goal of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponent, neutral, allies.
They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is necessary, sufficient perceptions and feelings.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the government's payroll or cartel, a catalogue of criminals who endanger Mexico's chaos.
There is no rest from violence, and while the bodies are increasing throughout the country, there are more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are following attacks and threats under federal protection and so far there have been at least seven deaths this year in seven states.
Among the latter are her publisher and her inspiration from Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His absence will be deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice", depends on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal court was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, it has initiated only two criminal proceedings.
As with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the murderers of journalists are rarely tried.
At Riodoce they still exist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are restless and although the terrain is now more treacherous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we suspect everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce newspaper office in the capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was arrested by two men. He was forced out of his car and was shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a wife and two grown children.
Rumors tend to fly freely to Culiacan.
But there is practically nothing as quiet as Valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's most bloody battlefields, as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
It does not matter that someone or more people will be shot on the street every day in Sinaloa or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings who are larger than many homes for the living.
For a minute forget that there is a state of "peace" if only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.
Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is devastated with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have upset the sons, suspected gang members bought up every copy of the edition once it was delivered to Zeitungskiske.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold $50 shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the rabies problem," Bojorquez said.
In time, the newspaper deserved a call for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish rigorous investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for her report in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever she led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life", he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"You must take over the task that happens to you as a journalist - either that or you play the fool.
I don't want to be asked, "What have you done in the face of so many deaths ... why didn't you say what happened before?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could fly like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and tips, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trust his routine.
He'd always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for the routine his destruction?
His death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do her job and stay alive.
"They don't like to work with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret starting and land railways," to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best times, is a high degree of self-sufficiency and self-preservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The problem is, the editor of Riodoce Andres Villareal said, "A sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happens to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer applicable in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other countries where a toxic mix of lucid smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the area where Riodoce staff met for security training, suddenly no phones were allowed. Days earlier it was known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 °C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the government to protect Riodoce's offices in a four-storey building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Half in the joke, some of the reporters wondered if these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the police officers who the governor himself referred to as unconfidential.
It has been months since the reporters went into the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are de facto controlled.
For this week's edition, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exhibition on state spending that focused on the Governor's hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was given when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place for drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter found out from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), who dominated almost all political levels throughout the century.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-quality cases of corruption.
Villareal asked the reporter to write about previous events in this room, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.
Only a few months earlier, the readers had seen the column of Valdez as the best informed source of the kidnapping.
"We had already known what happened," said Villareal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slim body condition.
"Now all channels of communication are broken with our sources."
Valdez's office was converted into a storage room for signs and stickers who protested against the murder of journalists because the employees had become something they had never expected themselves: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning because of another journalist at the prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials said, based on DNA tests, it's his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing "SOS Press" on roads and buildings in organised protests.
On this day, Director Bojorquez is gone to Washington and is trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying out journalists and killing them because they had told the truth.
She has since prayed that she be redivided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were organized crime, involved government officials and an equivalent society were " surrounded".
In his last book "Narco-Journalism", he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs but also by politicians and security forces who were involved in organised crime under a roof.
The media watch group "Article 19" assigned more than half of the attacks on police journalists and officials last year.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut," Ramirez said.
Apparently, the murder has a terrible effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found together with a note, allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am for my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphone were next to their separate head.
Some branches have chosen to close the El Norte newspaper in the northern state of Chihuahua following the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do what El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with a guide article on the title page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their homelands or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it seems to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who remain behind and continue to work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight the last Friday, when the last issue was finished, Riodoce's editors sat on the street front of the office and drank beer as they began to sum up all their phones.
A number of shootings with band rivals and security forces near the town of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed deaths.
The war continued as promised by a series of cartel messages in the region.
From the table stone corner they published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens were shooting in the vicinity - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the policemen who were watching to see if they were ready.
If they were afraid at all, they didn't show it.
Under the mighty portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all Sinaloa, Riodoce's employees followed his footsteps.
"How can you just think about it," Bojorquez said, "if on the same day Javier was murdered, the practitioner asked me to send her to the street to report."
Dinosaur tanning used to avoid his enemies
At first glance it looks like a statue, though also a frightening one.
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible Nashorn of a Canadian mining worker were so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs".
It was so well received that they could even find that his dirty skin was of red brown - and they said she had something of an "unsatisfied past".
The report in the magazine "Current Biology" referred to him as "the well-kept dinosaur that was ever found and one of the best dinosaurs in the world".
Fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurier that lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the credit period.
Its incredibly well received state has been surprised by researchers who describe it as "really remarkable".
According to reports in National Geographic, the pantized plant fiber is the best-preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he was found on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, rough.
He met something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy earthworms.
After all this hard work, the final result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you only blink a little with your eyes, you might almost think it's asleep," said chief author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.
"It will be included in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best received dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that although it is covered with a weapon and resembles a walking panzer, this plant fiber has probably been threatened by meat-feeding dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-esteem, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have made it possible to better mix around him and avoid his enemies, experts say, which means that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family first made battle lines in May and is now seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borelopelta markmitchelli, according to museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours discovering it carefully.
The amazing maintenance of the copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of cups and weapons over his body.
They discovered the countershading, a widespread method of defense in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although countershading is common, the results are surprising, since the size of Borelopelta is far superior to that of today's animals.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure by a meat-sucking dinosaur that evolution favoured the thickening of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use the countershading - think of rehe, zebras or belts - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which indicates that this nodosaurier was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"A strong predatory behavior on a massive, heavily pansy dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Creed Age must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal’s life, including its preserved intestine contents, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, ran into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank to the bottom of the sea.
At that time, Alberta was as hot as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further into the country as they are today.
"This nodosaurier is truly remarkable because it is fully covered with preserved skin, but is also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early credence.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you're just a little different with your eyes, you might almost think he's asleep."
The Creed era was a time, like huge theropodes, meat-feeding dinosaurs that stood on two legs, penetrated the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the tanked dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaur, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of severe monster.
Scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was mummified after death in the sea and in sludge.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was found on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, rough.
According to the museum, it is the best-maintained dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the snout to the hip.
On average, the creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tips that rumbled from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the panned plant fibers were swam through western Canada until an overflowed river flowed into the open sea.
But the underwater supply of the dinosaur kept his weapon in exquisite detail.
The enriched remains of this special copy are so well received that the Histers still cover helpful tanks along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of maintenance is as rare as winning in the Lotto.
The more I see it, the more confusing it will be.
Contained remnants of the skin still cover the handy plates that bear the skull of the animal.
His right foot is on his side, his five fingers are pointed up.
I can count the sheds on his sole'.
In the wet: mass carambolage on A8: Many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday night on the A8: Button 30 vehicles are converted into mass car embolism.
There are many injured, km-long staus and gaffs.
On the Stuttgart-München motorway (A8) some 20 people were injured in a mass car accident late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police, at 5 p.m., almost 30 vehicles, including trucks, were interlocked between the Adelthausen and Odelthausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm.
First, there were no data on the exact number of victims.
It's about minor to moderate injuries, said a police spokesperson.
A large supply of rescue vehicles was at the crash site.
The A8 was completely blocked towards Munich.
In the direction of München, there was a 10-km retreat.
As an AZ reporter reports, there have also been massive handicaps on the counterroad - through numerous strikes.
The firearm noted the signs of the vehicle links that now have to be counted with sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 6:45 p.m., a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car carrier and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the crash site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tested "Comfort Check-in"
It is a moment that almost everyone has already experienced: nothing in vain is sitting in the train and sleeping.
Or you're deep in your work and you just have a great idea.
And then: puffff.
Comes the creator and wakes up an unscrupulous or drives the passenger in the middle of the workflow.
Traffic control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the creationless driving licence control.
You simply confirm by phone that you take your place and then answer the driver's card.
Currently, a test operation is running on two lines.
"If the offer comes in, we expand it.
Then it is likely to be available on many other remote routes in Germany in the beginning of the year," said one railway speaker.
"Comfort Check-in" calls the train the ticket rating without a creator.
However, in order to make use of them, some conditions need to be met: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - what are most passengers doing anyway.
You also have to buy it via the train app that DB Navigator has bought, which is also the most convenient type of ticket booking.
And last time you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: You get in the train, you open up your ticket under "My Tickets".
In the test customers, then a button appears for electronic evaluation.
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that the passenger X is in the train and the booked seat Y is in.
If the train driver comes to place Y at the checkpoint, he knows that there is a passenger with an already rated online ticket.
So you can sleep, work, keep quiet.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which is to benefit the passengers again.
"Whoever wants to travel by train with our train without checking in, simply check in with the DB Navigator.
This enables passengers to make their travel time more personal," says Michael Peterson, Board of Marketing of DB Remote Transport.
Second Plus: "And our employees have more time than today to meet individual customer needs".
Those who often drive a train know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, driving card checks are among the biggest problems.
Because often you have yourself, but in any case one of your fellow travellers does not have all the documents you need to review online tickets.
Either the credit card or the staff card is missing or another document you have to present.
The consequences are endless discussions between train drivers and passengers, which leads to too bad a mood in the department or large room and delays in controlling your own ticket and takes time to take care of other matters at the end.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And this also applies to the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-eating.
Other train numbers on the same track are not fully switched off yet.
How did an activist come to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked to the core.
Only one day after she arrived in New York City, she was born in St. Louis on the bed of an airbnb apartment that she rented and rolled on her phone via Facebook.
She ran over a post from someone from high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," he said.
Confused that no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah has been constantly retweeted on her timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., to tweet live.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She dropped her phone to return later on evening to Tweets about people on the Canfield Drive.
There were pictures of the police band and people screaming, and of a man claiming to be Brown's father who wore a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a ringing dog.
In another video, she said, another cop unarmed his gun and cried, "I'm going to kill you... animals all."
"That's not common," Ferrell recalled her statement.
"That's not the kind of murder we've been used to and we can typically call it."
At this point, I felt gunned down.
I was angry and crying."
She booked a return trip and went home the next day.
After landing at 23 p.m., she took her six-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in the cinemas since the 11th.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and of resistance that exists from the perspective of the people who live in the Community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell and her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown, drove to Ferguson, they discussed a conversation that they had many times before this morning “about the black experience and the black condition”.
"Do you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for it, where they believe?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take them," Ferrell later said.
"What has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and be drawn into it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to be free to free ourselves.
Even if I'm lucky to give her an experience in which she doesn't personally experience any exaggerating racism, she's no different than the next black woman child.
I feel like I'd give her a bad service to keep her away from it."
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florida Road, a place opposite the police station that became a camp area when activists were waiting for the possible non-accusation of Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter connected to a local businessman who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly a new kind of activism for Ferrell started to be adopted.
"My activism has changed completely since 9 August," she said and noted that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association, she focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all here."
Weeks later, Ferrell met with Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farr wanted to "document" what happened.
A question came to the mind of Ferrell: "Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"
This skepticism has been nurtured by countless cases of people, often white - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resilience.
As Folayan recently said in an interview: "We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson had not focused their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already collaborated with former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism about death abstracts.
Ferrell brought the project closer, along with six other locals, followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary isn't someone who talks to us or talks to us. We're talking," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me how these people are represented, because that's how I'll be represented."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that in the movement it was "not a Messiah leader, but a community that gathers," Folayan said - it turned out to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife.
"I felt naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she first saw the finished product.
"But I understand that there must be some vulnerability to this work and to the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black women in the wider Black-Lives Mother movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who, following the murder of Black Teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as a schwul.
"Black, black women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole," said Ferrell, "and that's why we fight on different fronts all the time.
Black, black women must bear the main burden of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women".
However, it argues that "this is not an affirmative type of action", when Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who boosted this energy," she said.
"It is not an accident, although she was at the front because in a life on these crossings as a black, black woman is at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racist connections between the community and the police continue.
Ferrell is on duty for 21⁄2 years due to the blocking of a motorway during a demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home: "A Chaos".
Yet she clings to a song and feels obliged to this memory, since she went to the street in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains."
From "dream" to "size house": TV readers discuss Bit-Gallery
The bit gallery moves people, although it has not been built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping centre in the south of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
The subject hardly leaves one cold.
Also on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" the topic is discussed.
While those who say "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be real class" (Nicole Schausten), on the other hand, comes: "Do not need a human" (Siggi Betzen) or simply: "Grandma!" (Lars Scholz).
While supporters build on the fact that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, which also benefits the other businesses, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed out.
In addition: The gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farm market hall is located, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
With the start of the construction work, it will be concluded.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - which is to the Beda square with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying in the agricultural market hall for almost a week for many years.
Mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of rural women, are always very welcome.
We also discovered the Metzrei for ourselves.
We would like to know that even during and especially after the building of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.
In other cities there is this too.
In particular, the retail hall in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "If direct marketers sit in a market hall in the gallery, they reach the height of the rent.
However, this should not be very low in the new project."
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugs or supermarkets: I find this excessive.
There's enough of that in our town.
You can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least we get the market hall.
However, the product offered there is fresh, most of it is directly offered by the producer and is affordable.
As you can see, shop rentals in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies because the rentals there are often not portable for a retailer.
Unfortunately, special stores are almost gone and what is left of them will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit into Bitburg.
Above all, where should the agricultural market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even for a long time if the bit-gallery is ever actually coming.
Or does the spent Bit-Gallery ever manage to distribute all the businesses from Bitburg?"
George Marquet: "It just won't work.
And a shopping center that's empty doesn't need anyone either.
In my view, it would have been better to promote a proper agricultural market instead of this gallery.
But for a farmer's market hall there is no place for the crazy many - as I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg.
If the agricultural market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A fitting similarity: Artist creates Portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost unique - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-tupfern and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the cuts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former Secret Service Analyst violated a 35-year prison sentence after making diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website publicly classified as secret.
The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is A Becoming Resemblance (A suitable similarity).
It is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined its expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transfrequent and dissident whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg has a sharp, although some intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - created for identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly since her puberty about identifying as a woman, was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.
Her picture was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a dark, black-and-white selfie, in which the Manning was obviously uncomfortable sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blond wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was just from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of aliens from forensic artifacts such as cigarettes and rubber, by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of what these people might look like.
That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained in a press release of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked if she wanted to do a DNA portrait.
The artist and her arrested museums became unequaled letters friends who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images", illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which predicted a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would change and she would be able to see the exhibition personally.
In fact, the fact that Obama was only a few days after the book was published would require Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is also now some depth and strength in opening the exhibition, as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender troops in order to find new, two-way ways to reflame the rigid divisions that he should actually repair.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason".
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to the "automatic division, whose basis has been gender, race, sexuality and culture" with its superscription (the "i" in its family name).
On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by including the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist) how amazingly similar, at least biologically, we are all.
"What people will hopefully take from it is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also visible.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so these are the 30 stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novel.
She shows Manning how she appears with a freephone in her hand from the disciplinary cases of the United States like King-Kong.
"If they cold your speech, then they won," it says.
"So never keep your mouth shut."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who greets me from Philadelphia.
"I'm still getting a whole lot of skin when I talk about it."
Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was previewed in the comic book - but if she should do it, then she will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulators, which combine like hordes of Protestants.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to size (5 " 2, Mannings Statur), in which their genetic haplo groups were written with pencil.
"In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a lot of people," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed itself with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind her liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford wanted to kill
A nationwide manhunt is in progress for a professor at the Northwest University and an employee of the University of Oxford who is being sought out as a suspect after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.
On Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the acts of Cook County's official court show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several strikes.
A Community warning system published by the Chicago Police Office states that the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating the strike as murder, while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem is now in a permit and has been excluded from entering the campus of the Northwest University.
"This is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities, and the Northwest University cooperates in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is Senior Treasure Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesperson at the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in Britain and are willing to help US intelligence authorities in every way possible."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Office, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urged the suspects to stand up to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them are strengthened," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to find suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a terrible tip, saying that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27th.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza management team issued a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the timeline and the victim's background and are investigating a variety of reasons, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WADA flight plan in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
The Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the recovery of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSada).
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the driving plan, RUSADA has been granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK Anti-Doping.
The WADA flight plan was updated in this respect," Mutko explained on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA Roadmap to comply with the code that described the criteria for the reintegration of RUSADA and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could give Russia cause for concern.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and to the WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria set out in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must accept publicly the reported results of the Wada-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to allegedly state-funded doping in Russian sport.
Regarding the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation as our anti-doping system has made an error.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programmes, and we will not give anything that does not exist."
Mutko's words were in agreement with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
In the conversation with the Russian sales agency RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov added problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains conflicting positions and rules.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
In November 2015, RUSADA was excluded from the WADA's Doping scandal by conducting doping checks in Russia.
However, you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSada is moving "in the right direction" to be used again.
Aldi sells no eggs first
This was shared by the company groups.
This is a purely precautionary measure, which could no longer be affected by health problems, the Communication said.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to Aldi, which have been proven negative for fipronil-containing anti-inflammatory agents.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency with his customers.
The startups that will help your company do not become the next one
Amy Errett wanted to measure the happiness of your employee at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.
Answers were often vague, not helpful or - even worse - deceptive.
And even if you promise anonymity, some workers do not trust the process.
"There was just never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, contact special groups and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaints hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to deal with C-Suite leaders and to direct themselves to the Board of Directors.
"You now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytical tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Savet said that they gained a better view of what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glent.
In addition to the snapshot surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a hot card of the company that shows at a glance what units most of the complaints have and which leaders have low consent results - so you can imitate why.
Companies come to realize that they need to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you do not become the next obstetrician who has been developed in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of insults where those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire is a lucrative business opportunity for an overview.
Global governance, regulation and compliance could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, Start-up Converter, the company helps prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber case in miscredit.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnbb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently signed up as a client.
Like Glent, Convercent lets companies send custom "pull" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the hot cards of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And when the Chief Business Officer is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The Court of Public Opinion recorded the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and manager of Convercent.
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have a simple opportunity to reach their company headquarters.
Earlier, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often an embarrassment and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Council, who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees.
Now, as the company employs Convercent, problems previously identified and addressed by executives sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices - can be more quickly identified and addressed.
"I can get closer to this complete 360-degree view of employment experience," said Vitrano, who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until the "Social Media came to their right", that companies recognized that you couldn't prevent their dirty laundry going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and they charge companies with recurrent fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and a chance that finds the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both startups.
Convercent received $10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which raised the total capital to $47 million.
Glitzers secured $10 million in November from Besmer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than ever before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high fees and interesting projects are only investments.
Employees want to feel that you will be accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices belong, and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this company succeed," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glent.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are employed and engaged.
If the analytics tools promise to increase the commitment and use of the employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.
However, the data are useless if a company's administrator does not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it can expect change to be on the way.
And if the change doesn't come fast enough, or not at all, this can breed disappointments and discourage employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen the company rely too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow, employees will ask themselves, "Did you really hear me?
Are you taking care of it?
And if you don't take care of it, why should I?"
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about Glent, as saved.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganise several teams within the company through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, and to add communication training to address the problems.
With Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights about the employees, and it hopes that in the long term this will lead to a better bonding of employees in a sector that is known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, then you lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates two-day practices and makes a long day for the browns
It goes to 23 hours when a lot of UCLA football players are held on one side of the new training fields of the team on the campus.
Some have pulled their tricot parts and show the back full wet from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes represent a lunch break.
Players who have enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after three hours of practice before returning to the Waterman Football Center the next morning at 6:30 p.m.
"This is a real stepmill for the boys for the next three days," said coach Jim Mora just before Monday to Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the end of Friday.
Therefore, the first three trainings of UCLA should begin at 7:15 p.m. in order to meet the already completed timetables of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins moved the camp's start almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six playtimes in Westwood.
They will be held in the course of August 18 exercises. 20 before the beginning of the formal preparations for their launch against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supported the adjustment of the CCAA, even if she added another point to the multi-worked route of the players.
"We put this huge burden on her for three or four days, and it is very challenging," said Mora.
"And they just pushed it through, they stick around, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will really be great."
The UCLA will terminate its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which, in view of the clear guidelines of its fields from a nearby parking lot and the nearby Luskin Center, a hotel of the upper class, which has already been thrown with footballs, which have a protective net behind a torpedoes, will not be an easy task.
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel this weekend, but Mora admitted that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," said Mora.
"It's a real problem, and it's not far-reaching to think that people rent a room there and then settle down there to record a practice.
If you have the video tape from a practice, it's a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking lot 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
That's why I don't worry too much.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in the fight against false news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third-party reviewers and then show their results under the original contribution, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday. It's one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
In an opinion on his website, the company said that it would start using updated machine learning methods to identify possible false messages and send them to fact verifiers, which may show the results of the fact check from the original article.
Facebook has been criticised as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters being overrun by false stories before the May presidential elections, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to succeed in eliminating hate-filled posts like before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact check would be launched in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to the knowledge which stories of fact reviewers are being challenged by third parties, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, Product Manager for Facebook News in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the "linked article" and will work on other changes to its news feed to reduce mismessages.
Create a comic novel: A castle in the history of England
In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scottney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaaric Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says shyly.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' spans the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotland. Each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: He wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teath and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotional.
"I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter written by a doppelganger in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobines," he says.
"That's his thumb print!
And letters always smell after smoke, because then a fire was kindled because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if it were him himself.
Oh, I love archives!"
For someone so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome size") all this seems too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, reviewing the archive and studying the many treasures and curiositys of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the grave.
He travelled through the land and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape managers, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night he drank "Whiskey and started writing".
The intimate history of Scottney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes met a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundred years in which Aristotle said "Oh, throw it on the roof".
Journals, letters from the time of the English Empire, cards that represent who possessed what: "One might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to fight for the two families.
Boys, let everything go!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farming revolt of 1381.
"There is a recording of an uprising that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The farm revolt started in this area and I thought a rebellion was a good start.
Maybe the two of them are connected?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of Jesus' father, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', which depicts the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a sarg with stones (a discovery made only years later when his sarg was dug out).
The Darrells are the Rhodes' favorite family of Scottney: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite gauners, constantly making debts and spending money for things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking boys, with a talent to advertise.
After the end of his use in the castle Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has brought behind a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elemmenmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scottney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go back," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to finish this damn life again."
Campaign started: Over 300 years old Marien chapel hidden in Rhöndorf
With the cover of the 301-year-old Marien chapel in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new roof brand (dating of Thursday).
Even until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan hidden.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Very nice for us.
Or?", the action makers have asked about the posters at Rhöndorfer Kapelle since yesterday.
"We don't really think about it (of course!)," they wrote on their website that was released yesterday.
"But we use this measure to gain your attention.
And to make it clear that some are better than it seems.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Honnefer citizens know very well the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action involves more than "only" a logo and a slogan, it goes on.
"It is necessary to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable single-setting feature."
Finally, they compete with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost its new roof brand and the campaign a medium five-digit amount.
Military Reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's Fear of the Army
Every year at the beginning of August in Ankara, the Military Council (YAS) advises on pensions and transfers in the military corps.
So is this week.
At first glance a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup.
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff, as before, but in the office of the Prime Minister.
Under the chairmanship of the Government, the five Deputy Prime Ministers, as well as the Ministers for Defence, Interior, Justice and Foreign Affairs, also took part in the consultations.
Thus, the civilians in the YAS were in excess.
The government is pulling the toe in the military.
General Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces and the Navy have been removed.
Since the failed coup, chief Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and Admirals.
Over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to apparent connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gulen, who sees the Erdogan as a wired tortoise of the pit test.
Against 486 people who are supposed to have been directly involved in the potting test, negotiations will take place in Ankara this week.
On the day after the potch, Erdogan had called the coup attempt "gift of God" as he gave him the opportunity to "clean up the armies completely".
But does Erdogan really have the army in his grip?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Unsatisfaction in the Military Headquarters".
In general, there are concerns about an increasing "islamisation" of the army, which is manifesting itself, among other things, in the lifting of the cap ban on soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
The great cleansing of the army and the security forces continues anyway.
In mid-July, Erdogan issued a decree to fire 7395 other civil servants, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan had blocked the military.
The generals were older than the actual masters of the country.
Three times they relied on their role as guardians of the world state order.
Following his election in 2002, Erdogan withdrew the power of the military step by step, not least on the basis of the European Union's reform proposals.
Former officers say Erdogan drives towards Islamization of the forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", an unspecified officer warned that after a fear of beating in foreign asylum, the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If this happens, such development could not keep NATO cold.
Nevertheless, there is doubt in the alliance after the cleansings of the Turkish army's readiness to use.
The management structures and operational capabilities were "weak", Nato diplomats say.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
It provides for lowering legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for a limited work permit and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the United States will spend its citizens from other countries Green Cards."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and show the knowledge that will benefit our economy," said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to repair routes for race take-offs
Again and again, in the past few months, it has been argued about the future of the race stop - now it should go very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, to be built on the muddy track on which the tourist track runs.
In order to ensure the long-term future of the race stop, construction work on the track should begin this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to continue ordering and repairing the Ilmenau race line, the country is committed to this connection especially important for tourism," said Transport Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
He referred to the cost of maintenance of the routes to some EUR 2.5 million.
Of this sum, the country accounts for 75 per cent.
The contract, on which the Shuttle is to be ordered in the future from the country, is now finally agreed, declared.
The Ministry and the South Thuringia as operators have already agreed on the technical details.
"That's how the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," Sühl said.
The proposed contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of 11 years.
This will be ordered on a regular basis on December 2017.
The race-steig-Shuttle is a railway between the Ilmenau and the race-steig stations especially popular with tourists.
In the past months, during a pilot operation, it has been tested whether the route is used by enough people to order it regularly in the future.
The route is also highly cumbersome in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry
Just when you thought it couldn't get any crazier in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, an emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founders of the FRR, we have to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the chest and the type of fingernail.
"People make fun of them, but the companies deliver every amount of it, and we will see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey when he published his new report.
Modern espouses have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone hat that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adapt" his robot according to his beliefs and select everything, from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the chest parts to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it will be even more disturbing, as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern expatriates have developed into robots with a silicone shell.
For example, the RealBotix robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appropriate, such as shyness.
And then there is the Roxxy Gold Sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah", which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "advantageous" personality.
"Roxxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible," says True Companion's website.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods during the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixed on conversation or she can be "in mood"!"
There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the underlying female characteristics, the speculations of rape, when you take a step on frigid (i.e. here: opposing) Farrah, most worry.
On his website compare True Companion Roxxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have no Roxxxxy?" it says on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just hold another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing refinements point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Of course, most men do not have sex robots, and while the FRR notes its increasing popularity, they remain provisionally on the edge of consumer culture.
But what is secure from the border zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not curious or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is, however, a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, where there is a president in the White House who has pretended to have assaulted women sexually.
The most frightening aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Magd') are not the graphic images, the oblique bodies and the veiled eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap.
The aim behind these sex robots is to create a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (even with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel humanly that they imitate the movement of a real body.
But when it comes to their "personalities", robots are not real women.
They cannot separate from their companion or simply leave.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that would affect independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they're famous slaves.
Or to express it in the 2017 speech: Service girls
Trump's great performance?
He makes Middle Romney a part of the healthy human mind
It has become a bit of a reminder of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the U.S. electorate have also split families into small pieces of information.
Around Christmas and Easter, there were newspapers in the United States with tips on how to deal with the horror of relatives who chose Trump.
We're all working hard to put our filter bubbles in place.
Less noted is the power of Trump to bring together families.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican relationship with which she had fought for decades for politics, is suddenly and quite peculiarly on the same side.
The dining table is certainly a good thing, but I find it in another context that this also brings significant risks to itself.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the creative effect of his presidency has the power to move all of us to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we are referring to the terrible possibility that his measurements will no longer hit us one day.
However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario, in which the Trump Republicans of the right wing are "normalized", which suddenly appear as a form of reason in comparison to its standards.
Today, I find myself in favour of an active nostalgia for the middle of Romney's Urcomic version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax statement looked like) - both of them actually committed as very mild crimes compared to Trump.
When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must only be spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an essential improvement.
When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to Karussell in Central Park, the largest carussell in the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need a caffeine.
The horses are enormously large, the Fiberglas designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are clumsy and the animals turn around to look full of fear over their own shoulders - are extremely windowed and the climbing music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city are disappointed: the views of high buildings will be old, the Skylines will be trusted to give a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not be justified in the dream.
Fifty-five years later, and I'm still not all over the day when I found out that Swiss cottage is actually not a Swiss cottage - the theme-Pub Ye Old Swiss cottage does not count - but a great traffic in North London.
However, the Central Park Karussell is still a strange magical experience, since here two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go about it and everyone has a great time.
If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked for it.
On the other hand, this week I was forced into a shopping house to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I was able to cross my credit card.
In the coffeehouse at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to compare the rating with a 15% drink - this to buy something over the shop.
This not only slows down what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where it is not necessary.
The poor woman in the shop was terribly shy, while I was tired of having her own credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius with chest pain from prison transferred to the hospital
Pistorius has for the second time left the prison for a hospital visit.
Last year he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts at his wrists, which he reportedly took to the prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was sentenced for murder after an appeal from the state prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed Steinkamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her again and again through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a night's intrusion hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention this time to bring against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appeal, of which they say they are too vigilant.
The National Criminal Prosecution Authority said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors succeed.
There's no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Bluberger Schools, the fourth-class students from Futzen and Epfenhofen were released for holidays and further schools.
Three of the graduates will go to the high school in the future, four to the real school.
The school principal Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on the Tuesday evening.
The 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regina Meder, chose a young eagle who grew up in the chicken court, but will then be released to freedom.
In addition, the Münter Schar performed a musical titled "Der Adler in Hünerhof".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg, and let it break out of his chickens.
Instead of a chicken kitchen, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making him a chicken fell, the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain.
After that, the classes showed three and four in Yvonne Frank's study a chicken dance.
The hens danced with the young gocks who wore cylinders around the law.
The Adler stood for integration, said scholar Angelika Sitte.
Although the young animal is different from the other young animals (cows), it is part of it.
But he'll never be like a chicken.
His destiny is to be free.
She wanted every four-chatter to feel accepted in his new school.
It followed the words of thanks to colleagues, former school principal Michael Müller, who always jumped back into the classroom, and the parents' representatives.
The cooking time was over, class teacher Sophia Schumacher explained.
After two years of teaching, she lets her students go to school just so much less, because it was a really great time.
Finally, they were able to rely on the four-chatters.
Finally, all the students were able to sing a song of summer time and holiday time.
There was great joy among the children.
For the new school year, eight first-class students have already been registered.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television, told them.
On the morning of August 1st, a group of illegal tent people, including the two Bulgarians, were arrested by the police in Sithonia.
They were released on the same day while an investigation is underway.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have intensified the control of the free camp and have imposed significant fines on anyone who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
Controls shall be continued throughout the whole season.
The Ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What the affected need to know now
How exactly is the software update going on?
Should diesel drivers participate in the action?
The main questions and answers in the overview.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars of the Euro 5 emission classes and partly the Euro 6.
Euro-4 Diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously apply only to vehicles that have foam software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their refurbishment has been ordered by the KBA.
How and from when are customers informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced a prompt implementation in the coming months, but have not yet mentioned a precise date.
Daimler has informed us to contact every person concerned.
If an inspection is necessary, it will be carried out within their framework.
How long should the equipment go to total?
"It's hard to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the involvement of manufacturers and political pressure.
"Because we have seen that the car manufacturers have not acted voluntarily on the topic of the environment so far."
How long the update should take
The equipment itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop.
It may be more time consuming to get a date.
What are drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?
The ACE advises to wait.
It is likely that foreign producers would be attracted, says Smetanin.
Is there a massive price drop in Euro-4 cars?
The ACE is afraid of that.
But just in the regions where driving bans are threatened.
In the rural area there are so far no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait for a sale.
LL Cool J gets Kennedy Center Award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first prize award under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners does not want to come - from protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the desired awards from the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year also includes singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95).
The awards will be given at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and join his wife Melania in the ceremony.
For this reason, Lear, a progressive TV series winner, already announced that he would refuse to participate in the Gala.
The "New York Times", he said, "this Presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of the means - and this is a burden on me."
The 59-year-old Stefan stressed that they would use the conversation with Trump to clarify their views.
The Kennedy Centre, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting are among the former prize winners.
We're making the city a living.
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city planner, is going to rent next year.
The place has already been written out - however, suitable applicants are rare.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And the work still makes him great fun, as he communicates in the press.
He reports on varied but demanding tasks that await his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application so far meets the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer as soon as possible.
In view of the regular deadlines, this should be enough time for transposition.
As Haslach acts as a subsidiary of the administrative community, the applicant must present the relevant conclusions.
Because this function wants to keep the city anyway.
If they could no longer fill them, the citizens would have to travel to Offenburg for advice.
But closeness to citizens is important to the city and to itself, says Wacker, who reports on a good operating climate as well as good mood between authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in the office, some important projects have gathered, looking back on the Wacker with pride.
"We make the city a living thing," he says about the building and his employees.
But in the future there are also many different projects on the agenda: For example, the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen park are under attack.
The Kinzigbridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the stadiumization is still the subject.
Only the last one will hit the book with about 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right", estimates Wacker.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun."
Designally, there is a large play area for a city builder.
With haslach's own bauhof and gardening, you can react quite flexibly to many.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the greenery is often mentioned by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town as an ensemble is under the protection of the memorial, it is important to "have an eye for what is clean", when new buildings are approved, the separate city builder emphasizes.
Without it, the city planner bears a high responsibility.
He's a builder, "it's all over my table at the end."
With care and coordination, he can count on long-term employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been in Manfred Schöner (Diefbau) for ten years now for 15 years.
Even that his successor remains long, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really identifies himself and wants to stay."
Because continuity is important not only for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.
Anyone who wants to acquire Roland Wacker should be able to present a completed study as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor with a degree in architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction and planning law.
The city building is subject to high and deep construction, construction planning, basic business matters, management of the city property, the city farm with the city building and gardening, as well as the lower construction authority, including the protection of monuments.
Throwed bicycle on wires: South railway line blocked
According to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had cast the blue bicycle from the railway transmission in the field of the Leobener Street (B116) on the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators have been searching for two men and have been looking for them for hours of the night.
Near the scene, a rosary roller and a bicycle driver were observed by witnesses.
"This goes far beyond a loop line," said ÖBB spokesperson Christoph Posch to the APA.
Those or the perpetrators would have put themselves at great risk and also risked their train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locator and the plant, as well as the delay minutes and the cost of rail replacement services, there could also be pönals of the railway customers to the perpetrators.
Overall, it was a "significant" sum, the speaker said.
The damage was recuperated on Friday afternoon, and the rail traffic on the southern railway route could be carried out without obstacles.
Nearly ten passenger trains had arrived on Friday morning, two of which were involved in remote transport.
Goods didn't fall out, but they were late.
According to ÖBB-Speaker Christoph Posch, about 200 metres of overheads had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate may help to relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like an alpine dream for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: A diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and milk products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition that affects about 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach cramps and swellings, recurrent or bleeding, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While the victims are usually advised to avoid meat and milk products in order to relieve their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to the development of immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in food do not enter the body.
Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are offset by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory dark disorder.
Experiments have found that a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance occurs in mice that carry a certain bacteria in their intestines.
And the bacteria need tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have created a link between a type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbium, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had these immune cells."
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a rich diet on tryptophan promote more tolerance, less inflammatory intestinal environment, if the same system also works in humans.
The postdoctoral Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain, which was separated, did not have this.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the mouse's intestinal microbes - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the stomach tract.
The edges of the mice were sequenced and six types of bacteria were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells but were not missing in the mice.
Mouse was raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked a intestinal microbial and did not develop these types of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
In order to understand how bacteria affected the immune system, researchers let L. reuteri grow in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells that were isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3 lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mouse feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that people have the same tolerant cells as mice and that most of us have L. reuteri in our stomach tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote as these cells control inflammations on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high tryptovalues in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United with Nemanja Matic has committed a "genie"
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic signed a "genie", Jose Mourinho believes after the middle-field player had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
The 40 million pounds of Chelsea's signature began with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game, before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid started on Tuesday, and impressed in the retainer role, as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira pretended to be.
Matic, however, was excluded from the preparation Asia tour of the Blues and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho said he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We'll help him be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started in the Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho formed his start XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new obligations, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fictional work" to fulfil three of its four priority new obligations.
"To get three out of four, I thank the association for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get me four out of four, but they've done a lot of work."
Bowing "paint" dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots fled from Seattle in Washington, U.S.A., but the drawing began in Marquette in Michigan, U.S.A., and moved in the form of a dreamliner across the U.S., which is thousands of miles away.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was the form of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was an extension test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such advertising before.
Thus the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New Deepfall for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
As the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD head, social democratic ministers always looked ahead to elections with some concern for Berlin.
Only no interference from the party centre, just no opposing wind from the federal government - so the most important desire of the voters was said.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, employees from the Willy-Brandt-House have been watching the events in the SPD-run capitals with growing dismay.
What Schulz has got from there since the beginning of the year would not have been described in the opposite direction.
It was a deep blow.
And one after the other.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Bundes-CDU sees a general signal against SPD and Green coalitions.
"This shows once again: Red Green can simply not rule reliably," said CSU Secretary General Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprising Group Austerity of a Green Member has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the country election, his red-green coalition lost its single majority vote against the opposition from CDU and FDP.
Green Federal Business Manager Michael Kellner has called on the downtrodden Lower Saxony Green Deputys to return their mandate to the West.
The violation of the CDU means a clear falsification of the will of the electorate.
Each West must return its mandate immediately," said the head of the Federal Trade and Election Committee of Greens to the drafting network Germany (RND).
"That may not be all true," a SPD voter shouts when on Friday morning the new hiobs message reaches the party centre.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is there after the violation of the Green Elek Twest to the CDU without its own government majority.
It is the preliminary highlight of a whole range of major and small crises in SPD country associations.
And no one knows what's coming next.
The Misery began with the unexpected significant downturn in the Saarland elections in March.
A blue eye, no longer, calmed down the companions of his time.
After the elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
That was then - and it all got much worse.
The landing in Kiel brought the SPD into the taumeln, the Düsseldorf-Pleite is smoothing the party.
The companions got tired of remembering again in the weeks after.
Then, when they had just created new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next downfall.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD landmaster, lost his Nimbus on that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphil harmony while burning his city.
And because he made quite the wrong thing to do in the crisis communication afterwards.
Since then, school has been fighting for its political survival.
So now, even Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW-abgas affair and its role in the Board of Supervisors, the Dutch Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time.
Mr. Questionnaires came in.
Still, or perhaps just because of it, because in the past weeks, it has been more and more intense to put emphasis in the federation.
The aim of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin was also not hidden from his colleagues in the area of Martin Schulz.
They let him in because they promised to stabilize the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
Because of this, there is basically no blame on the internal branch of the Lower Saxony Greens.
And not even Schulz.
Sometimes the partners try to keep their own lines closed.
Her anger is directed at the Greens, and here in particular at the dejective parliamentarian Twest.
"It is unbearable and democratic, as Mrs. Twesten puts her own career interests over the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, Head of the Party Links in the SPD Federal Day Group, the Editorial Network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has not been elected as a direct candidate for her person but has been elected to Parliament through the Dutch Greens' national list, as the Dutch Member continues.
The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Bundestags Group, complained of a "undemocratic maneuver".
"The voter's will was clear four years ago: People made Stephan Weil the Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a top candidate in the federal election, RND.
"Now the personal career memory of a future CDU MP is falsifying the election result," Oppermann continued.
He called for clarification of the background.
I want to know if there has been more or if there have been further commitments from the CDU Low Saxony.
Funding for local core III
Anyone who wants to repair a house in the years to come can soon receive support from the country.
About this, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG urban development were informed in receptions on Wednesday.
At the beginning of the information event Schindler once again gave a look back on what had happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been recuperation areas in receipts.
At that time, the Land of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the total funding from 1991 to 2004.
In the recovery zone II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still at 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "success project" - it is important to promote internal development as well, and not only to unlock new areas.
On 4 April, information was received from the Karlsruhe Government Bureau that there will be a rehabilitation area III.
The amount of aid is EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 comes from the country, the rest of which are received from the municipality.
How does a rehabilitation area come about?
You're going to go further, Schindler, to investigate where the "real old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role in repairing whether there is any interest in the planned area at all.
Where appropriate, the territorial boundaries could then be shifted again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday.
Keller presented the contents of the federal program "Social City", in which the reforms would then be carried out.
The main focus of the programme is the revitalization of cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out in respect of objects, i.e. property.
The area of rehabilitation would then be defined as a statute.
The period of authorisation for the funding shall continue from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
However, until September this year, the inventory would only be carried out once, within the framework of which the participants in the rehabilitation area would receive a questionnaire to fill out.
As soon as possible in November or December, the Constitutional Decision will take place so that the reforms can be started in the coming year.
Pietzschmann then declared that each municipality had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations.
It is about assessing and deciding when and to what extent urban failures are corrected.
A repair note will also be entered in the basic book for the property concerned.
Pietzschmann himself will come to receive again and make himself a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants.
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent postalally to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "construction and real estate book", in which it concerns, among other things, the construction condition and the restoration purposes.
In the grey questionnaire, the "budget and housing book", data can be made on the size, distribution and inhabitants of a living room.
The blue "operating arc" is only to be completed when the premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel points out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new measures are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funds works according to the "windhund principle" - who comes first, paint first.
You can't make money for "booking" later.
In conclusion, photos of the project "Storknern II" were shown to make the participants "tasteful".
British inventor sets himself a microchip to come with a hand movement into the house and car
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open his house door, enter his office, and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and fingers and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company BioTeq.
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson, an anaesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hunts, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the lockers to houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, everything for a price of £300 per castle.
The married father of one has now built up both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is on the tax.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands
The White House's decision to fly a Marine helicopter to South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers according to the military's data that were left to the TIME magazine up to $24,000.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heartpiece of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and Chief White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter made in Connecticut was displayed in addition to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin firefighting car and a Mississippi forklift.
The military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, almost 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, following the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," the commander of the HMX-1 wrote on the eve of the event to his commanding officer, the deputy commander for aviation.
The message indicated that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on July 17 at 7:00 a.m. for the event at 3:00 p.m., and remained for so long until the race was cleared at 6:00 p.m. to 21:00 p.m. tonight.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, a second flight crew would be required due to the limitations of the hours of service.
The original flight crew was on the helicopter during the event, while the unit's safety staff remained on the ground during the flight time.
The records provided by the TIME did not make clear whether a second flight crew was needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 has asked whether the event could harm the determination.
"A question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're closed," answered the Deputy Commander.
The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the President launched an attack on the reform of the health reform that was under way in the Senate and spread the efforts to enforce the government rules.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for their journey.
But to require their use only for a photo op is unusual.
In February, Trump conducted an investigation when the Presidential aircraft provided taxi services in front of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports that complained about the use of the Presidential aircraft by his predecessors.
"The White House is thrilled by the show "Made In America" - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials," said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to put the US presidents in the White House with precise centimeters.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercises in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event was counted on the training needs of the flight crew for the month, one official said.
Helicopter units flew for 11 hours on this day for "Non-presidency support missions".
The White House said that the taxpayers took over the burden for none of the other requirements presented at the event.
One Sikorsky spokesperson said the company had not been involved in exposing the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for the President's flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event.
According to US Ministry of Defence hourly rates for the 2017 financial year, however, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is USD 24,380 per hour.
Records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility home base in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual costs of operating the helicopter are far below this rate.
"To determine the costs for taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for the refund rates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual resources."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include staff costs but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At that time, the former press speaker of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present this week things that are made in America," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the Federal State Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not even thousands of people depend on it.
And I think like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly for.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this."
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver’s seat of a firefighter.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW News in front of a cliché
The top rider of the Second Tennis Bundesliga will take part in the third table of SV Searchsdorfer.
The TC Blue-Weiss Neuss will enter Kiel from 11 a.m. to the third table search village SV.
Despite the fact that after five parties, the top rider of the Second Tennis Bundesliga still has the sense of reality.
Team leader Marius Zay has any respect for the opponent.
"It's a compact team that always plays in pretty similar formation.
Just in the back position, I find the team very good."
For class and stability in the SV search village, imports from the high north are mainly provided.
"Their dances and Finns can even refer to investments in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in double," says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all of Denmark).
"It will be as hard for us as ever.
You also need a good lot of luck."
The Neusser team for the trip in the high north is practical.
His debut for blue-white could give Maxime Janvier.
If it does not yet reach the German Bundesliga Party, the Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) who is currently in the challenger tournament in the Italian Biella will be the first player in this season.
The previously undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was yesterday with the white Russian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel at the ball.
He should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both the Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could again join the team.
If it is not enough for 18-year-old Hungary, which was still the number one of the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the training staff around Marius Zay fills the box.
How America can damage the OMV
Indeed, Donald Trump was not happy when he placed his signature under the law on strengthening sanctions against Russia on Wednesday.
"In his haste to pass the law," the Congress packed a few "unconstitutional rules", he ate.
The reaction from Moscow was as acute as expected, and Brussels itself was looking forward to the US.
At the same time, the draft proposes to punish European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Accordingly, investors of domestic OMVs, who together with other European companies, have been concerned about the construction of the Russian East Sea Directorate Nord Stream 2.
The Drohkulisse is mighty.
However, it was too early for an assessment of the consequences, so the official statement of the oil group.
In fact, Donald Trump himself had to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons are at his disposal.
"The press" looked at which group could refuse and which could really hurt him.
Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be taken to the centre in the speed of Netflix
Despite the second stack of Narcos, revealed by Pablo Escobars Killer, the series of Netflix is not over for long.
The stacks of three and four were already confirmed by the Streaming service, the first one received their first trailer and showed the latest evil weights of the show.
With the third staff, the DEA has focused its attention on the world's richest drug trading organization: the Cali cartel.
Guided by four powerful patents, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" with only more state fraud and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) in charge of the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is in New York.
In the recently released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type that invites US and Colombian law enforcement authorities to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third staff of Narcos will begin on 1 September.
Roll back: The city puts 46 kitchen aids
The city reorganises the Kita lunch table itself.
With firm contact partners for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is returned to the city's children's playgrounds.
On 1 September, the town of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the city's children's day facilities (Kitas).
For Sonja Pomeranz, Deputy Head of Youth Assistance, this is a good news: "We have all been very happy".
Cooked continues outside the house: A catheter takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked cold.
The town operates 46 children's places in the Krefeld area, in 44 children get a warm meal at lunchtime.
Last year, 2,800 children sat at the tables, and the need keeps growing.
"In the meantime, not only do children who are cared for for 45 hours a week eat in the Kita for lunch," Pomeranz explains.
"The offer is also valid in 35-hour care if children stay up to 14 hours."
46 Part-time forces have a kitchen service from September 1st: they heat the angel-made foods, supplement them with salad, raw food and fruit, share the meal individually, deliver the food, clean the kitchen, and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are assigned to a kite," says Pomeranz.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups of institutions - determines the range of hours.
"The kitchen assistants now belong firmly to the Kita team," Pomeranz says pleased.
"So they are much more involved and it is for the Kita leadership to implement simple, pedagogical concepts".
This is also the case: healthy food and cooking.
"The kids are supposed to help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is useful.
Also for the children.
"They have a well-known power in the Kita, a person who is familiar with them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - up until now also the task of the kitchen forces - will be accomplished by special cleaning staff in the future.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has in addition to the quality improvement of kitchen performance also the charm that it has displayed itself in comparison to the cost of owning and abroad for the city as the most economical one, says the press office.
And that, although 46 part-time forces are re-set.
"But these hours don't fall into weight for about 750 people in education," says Sonja Pomeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, the UN says
Elections can only be representative if all members of the society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the official leader of the United Nations mission, said that hundreds of women will run in the provinces in the Council elections. Three women will run for the role of Vice-President and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate unrestrictedly and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the Provincial Council and presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have issued threats against a electoral process that coincides with the transition from international combat to a consultative role.
This year the elections will be handed over for the first time to power peacefully from a democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will further strengthen Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women from a total of 3.6 million registered voters have been registered.

Whoever needs a ride from Kaiseren to Frohnstetten: meeting point is in Kaiseren at the school.
Men try to rape a 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the 13-year-olds who were staying at the Kolpingstraße spoke at 2:55 p.m. because they wanted to call the girl's phone.
The 13-year-old refused the request and went on with her friends.
Then one of the offenders tried to grab the girl's phone and necklace, which failed.
Without help, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigations are under way.
GMB concern about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union would like to make sure of the long-term obligation to produce in its work in Glasgow with the managers of the Bishop-Manufacturer McVitie.
GMB Scotland said that the company had lied about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the work, which is produced alongside other products Hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekse.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would "be first experienced" if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland McVitie called on "to express concern that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be advanced".
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross involves our members.
Generations of families have worked here, and the workers have a strong focus on the local community and the large-scale Glasgow, an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and in the background of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flourishing production presence at McVitie."
A spokesperson for Pladis said: "The branch manager at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly to it, as we appreciate the continued commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies that are working in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly checking our business - and this is true for all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross site, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We recognize the legacy of Tollcross as a fully-fledged production site. If our operations change at the site, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this."
Did the PSG Barcelona warn Neymar three years ago?
The page of La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not be left in her persecution of Neymar after she has made an offer of £ 189 million to release her release clause, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record attack?
The sensational approach has warmed the transfer window in summer, because the League 1 club is ready to break the world record more than double the previous brand, while Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds.
After the end, Neymar will become the world's cheapest player and the world's highest paid professional sportsman. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona is angry at the way Neymar has forced his way out, although there is a source near the Catalan government that has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned by the PSG president three years ago in front of this prospect?
When Manchester City 2014 showed interest in the signature of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaiifi had a strong warning for every association that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll stand in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players to sign with themselves, it will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line, with the Spanish Association expressing interest in the PSG middle field player Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar.
Roll over and damaged
On the night of Friday on Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately turned over a wheelchair on the King's Landing Street before number 30 and thus caused damage to the vehicle's clothing of more than 200 euros.
The Schramberg Police, Phone 07422/27 01-0, asks for information.
In an accident at the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese the police are looking for witnesses.
Because a car hit him on his tracks, the driver of a VW Touran had to leave and touch the guideboard.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW at 7.55 p.m. on the B 215 from Stolzenau was on his way towards Leese.
In the area of the town of Stolzenau, a car came against him on his tracks, so he had to turn right.
The touran driver touched the guideboard.
Sachsdamen was born in the car.
The driver of the car, a Mercedes Benz, had overloaded a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident.
It may be good, according to the accident owner, that the Mercedes driver had not even noticed the accident.
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident and the driver of the cause vehicle to contact the Office of the Commissioner in Stolzenau on tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report released by Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on abuses relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger.
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the scandal of abuse in the Regensburg domspatzen continues to provide for discussions.
Christian Weisder, spokesperson for the Reform Movement "We are the Church", said after publishing to the German Press Agency, he expected an apology from the former Bishop of Regensburg and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Domcapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI...
It would be very helpful to consider the Catholic Church if Muller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret over their own omissions or their false assessment of the proceedings at that time.
On the other hand, the Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" criticised the report on violence in the dominoes with "two-way measures".
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that they are "disgusting and shameful acts", which must be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "Grade Medial Manipulation" is noteworthy, according to author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Committee on Bioethics.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal," says Scaraffia.
In the interview with the Bavarian radio, Prince Gloria of Turn and Taxis also said, "You'd like to go to the church and that's a found bread."
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth, "beats were a very normal pedagogical means" to "end up with ugly children like I was one".
She found it unfair to apply today's standards to decades ago, because the world has changed.
In connection with reports of abuses, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger also appeared.
The author and historian Michael Hesemann, who with Ratzinger wrote the memorial band "My Brother of the Pope" (translated in 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he appreciates the results of the final report.
What exactly is stated in the 440-page report submitted by lawyer Ulrich Weber, commissioned by the Bishop of Regensburg, with the clarification?
A total of 547 Regensburg domspatzens were sexually abused between 1945 and early 1990s with high plausibility.
In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg, said: "In summary, therefore, it can be said that in many cases forms of physical and mental violence have been applied by Domcapellmeister R..
Especially in the case of high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
However, unlike many other accused, many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even in spite of violence, connect positive memories with him."
In the interview, Hesemann explained why the final report on the scandal of abuse at the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger expressed his opinion.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "occurrence of violence against law enforcement officers in the Regensburg Domspatzens" gives a contradictory picture of Domcapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
Many of his "humanity" is highlighted by a number of students.
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who became handy when a domspatz musically failed to achieve top performance.
How do you view this final report as his biography?
Michael Hesemann: If you are working hard and read the entire 440 pages long report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is in it.
He has just been dedicated eight pages and he is clearly free from any suspicion of co-worker or co-scientificity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The violence at pre-school also occurred outside its scope.
At any rate, it can be suggested that he learn too late or that he has not taken the first indications seriously enough.
The domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was felt by practically all respondents as - so literally - "resolve", "heaven" and "better world".
Thus, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger presents an excellent witness, describes him as "hot heart", "loved", "sincere", "competent" and "understanding", as a very kind teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and was "always surrounded by grapes of children".
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has already led to outbreaks.
Not only did he kneel with the chairs and throw the key-band on the floor, but he also spread ears and dragged all too many boys to the hair or ears, he admitted himself years ago, deeply regretting and apologized for it.
However, in his honor, it must be said that such education methods were widely disseminated to parents as well as to teachers during the Question Time, the 1960s and 1970s.
Do you still know such methods of rearing?
Of course, I think each of us was born before 1968.
I have also experienced this in a world school, a state high school.
Compared to what is actually involved in this report, namely sexual abuse and pre-school violence, these are free bazaars.
You're wondering if it's not more about his acquaintance and his role as Benedict XVI's brother that a lot of media just hit him.
In the Bavarian Pope, many who never understood him still work hard.
But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!
In the media, a great deal has been reported in connection with the report on abuse in the Regensburg domspatzen.
Will Georg Ratzinger be charged with any development or co-operation in the final report with regard to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Not really.
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have relied on the master of the house.
Not even the parents were engaged.
"I never trusted to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one concerned deputy for the others, "It was very painful for me."
The real problem in clearing up sexual abuse was, and it is, that most of the victims are shy.
If they didn't even trust their parents and siblings, then they wouldn't definitely be a choir leader who would certainly have been a co-worker of the perpetrators.
How, then, do Domspatten-School Ratzinger's role in relation to abuses?
Michael Hesemann: An interrogated student put it this way: "I see ... no case in which he had calculated (Georg Ratzinger) timely findings and could have stopped the perpetrator.
I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that it is calculated to him ... have opened up bubbles more intrusive or clearer or more open than against their parents, internatists, trust teachers, etc.
That you're talking to him about sex... - inconceivable."
In this way, the report concludes with a clear statement: "The fact that the students concerned and/or their environment in the case concerned could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation".
Thus, as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is free from any cognition.
In this way, it cannot be proposed that he should not be prevented or brought to the notice.
Therefore, there is also no reason to link his good name with these reprehensible crimes, as it has unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media, there was a lot of "violent xessen" to read at the Regensburg domspatzen.
The previous Chief Justice Georg Ratzinger is referred to in the report "Sightseeing".
Does he have to live with this pretense?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that everything was mixed up in the report and mixed up with a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is precisely a misuse of the report.
It is clearly separated: between the preschool and the gymnasium of dompaits, between sexual abuse and violence, and, once again, we say, other rejections.
In addition, the report has dealt with events since 1945, including four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir leader of the domspaits.
All the terrible prügeldagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were regularly scolded and abused and were forced to leave behind, all agreed at the preschool in Etterhausen and Pilenhofen, where really scandalous conditions had to prevail.
But with whom the Master of Justice Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with, because he only got the boys face-to-face when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
It was on that, as most witnesses emphasize, the topic of "preschool" tabu.
You were just happy to escape her and enjoy the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What else was there at the domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was already discipline, but there was no sadistic force.
And that is also true of Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even in spite of violence, connect positive memories with him".
That's the way it's supposed to be.
Despite all the efforts, however, the report was able to define only two time periods in which it was reported to him by the pre-school conditions.
The first time in 1970/71, when he began to establish himself, he did not want to hear anything from the proceedings at a school where he had just not acted and was responsible, (so the witness) and then only again in 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger close in front of the state, which is why the ears?
Michael Hesemann: No, since in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
He pointed out that "in pre-school the punishment is still practised".
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when the sentences were long banned in Bavaria.
Before, they met in a legal grey zone, as each of us knows.
It was also difficult for him to estimate, where the victims might have exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he'd always been away.
That's just not true.
It was only in 1980 that the prison sentence was officially abolished in Bavaria.
President Gloria von Turn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply the present educational standards at that time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "fallstick of Anachronism", that is, the danger of assessing the past according to today's moral standards.
That's where the prince is right.
But this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which has always been repugnant, nor to what was broken up in the preschool on revulsion and violence against innocent children, which is far beyond what was then common.
That's all terrible and I'm glad it's finally working out.
But at the same time, I have to protect Georg Ratzinger because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, that is, to draw ears and ears to the hair and ears, were widely distributed in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then prohibited, he also refrained from it.
What picture of his Regensburg era did Georg Ratzinger give you in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Did the subject of přügelspare also come to the language?
Michael Hesemann: Well, in the book about the life of his brother Joseph, Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, the dominoes played only one side role.
Still, I don't give a shit that he was running a strict regiment there.
But this must be said once again: Without this perfectionism, without requiring unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world rank from the so-called nationally well-known Regensburg domspatzs, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, who went on tour twice in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With cookies and bonbons alone, you can make no great singers and stand before any success, no matter which area, but always discipline, passion and self-resurrection.
As a man, have you ever experienced Georg Ratzinger talking to her book?
Michael Hesemann: By working on the book and beyond, I have really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and always again as a wonderful, humorous, thorough, deeply believing and good-hearted person, from whom one can’t imagine that he could do anything wrong just one flight.
I get regular contact with him, visit him, read him - he's almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.
Those who did not forgive him until today that he once was strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Most domspaits are grateful to him today for enriching his life and bringing the world of music to them.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, of course, that may be - but he was also a precious person of respect to whom they still look up to today and who they just adore.
And pray, once again, quite clearly: all that is before him is educational methods that were then on the agenda.
We can be happy that we have overcome this time for a long time.
But it is highly unfair to make a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial sinr.
There is only too obvious the evil intent behind it.
Because the report just published releases him.
Now it would be an excuse for a 93-year-old man who has earned great profits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany, no one would know the Regensburg domspatten at last in peace.
