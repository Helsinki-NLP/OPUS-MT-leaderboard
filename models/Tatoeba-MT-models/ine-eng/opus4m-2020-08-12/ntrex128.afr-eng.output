Members of the Walli Congregation are worried they're going 'like soots'
There is a concentration among some members on the proposal that they change their title from AM to MWP (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Wally Parliament.
Members of the political spectrum are afraid it can trigger a mockery.
One member of the Workers' Party says his group is concerned because "it's with Twp and Pwp rhym."
For readers outside Wallis: In Wallies, twp means stupid and pwp means discharge.
A meeting member of the Plaid Cymru some say the group as a whole is "not happy" and suggested alternative.
A member of the Wallian Conservative Party says his group is "acceptable" about the name change, but noted that it is a short speech from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of salt or stupid.
In this context, the Wallian Letter is spoken to you as the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently designing legislation to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptions of what is called Members of the Assembly will, of course, be a matter for the Members themselves."
The Law on the Government of Wallis 2017 gave the Wall meeting the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals that were widely supported to call the meeting a Wallian Parliament.
As regards the title of the AM, the Welsh Parliament Committee chose Members or WMPs, but the MWP option was most approved in a consultation with the public.
The AM is apparently proposing alternatives, but the fight to gain consensus can be a major pain for the president, Elin Jones, who has to propose a legislative proposal on the changes within weeks.
The legislation on reforms will also include other changes to the way in which the meeting operates, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the draft committee system.
The AM will get the last statement in the question of what they should be called when they discuss the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of country name
Voters will vote Sunday whether their country's name should be changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was arranged in an effort to clear out a decade-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself had called a province of Macedonia.
Athens has been insisting for a long time that the name of his neighbor in the north represents a claim in his area and has repeatedly captured his applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on the name change, said that he would ignore the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, however, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The clocks of St. Martin's get quiet because churches in Harlem are in trouble.
"Historyly spoken," said the old people I spoke to, "there was a crow and a church was on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"None of the two are there today."
He says that the disappearance of crows is understandable.
"People socialise today in other ways," he said.
"Khroe is no longer the neighborhood's family rooms where people go regularly."
As for churches, he is concerned that the money from battalion sales will not last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they are back exactly where they started."
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums full of the kind of people who will not help the neighborhood’s remaining shelters.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white," he says, "and that's why the day that these churches completely closes will bring them even closer, because most of the people who enter these condominiums will probably not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved away in the 1930 ’ s.
A black congregation that worshiped nearby took over the title of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Eerw. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott from retailers in 125th Street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who did not want to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 badly damaged the building, but while Father Johnson’s members made plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
Erew. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the poor people's watches".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the largest carillon at the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather says St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What St. Martin's played in the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The church council, the congregation's governing body, consisting of lay leaders -- wrote in July to the bishop with concern that the bishop "try to transfer the costs" to the council, although the council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors who sent the bishop.
Some congregation members complain about a lack of transparency on the part of the bishop.
Sharks hurt 13-year-olds on crustaceans in California
A shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday and injured him on the first day of the cancer season in California for cancer, officials say.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he was drowning with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and then set out with a group closer to help him get out of the water.
Hammel says he first thought it was just the excitement of a first crab catch, but then he realizes 'that he calls, 'I'm bitten!
I'm bitten!'
His whole key leg was broken open," Hammel saw when he came out to the boy.
'I called out that everyone should come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' Hammel added.
The son was taken to the Children’s Hospital Council in San Diego, where his condition is described as criticism.
It is not known which shark species are responsible for the attack.
Lifeguard. Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark was noticed a few weeks ago in the area, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of his upper body.
Officials closed the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for reasons of investigation and security.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan to expand to UK beauty market
Sainsbury's says Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams are fighting department store-type beauty walks that are by specialist assistant man.
As part of a major expansion in the US’s £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and household goods decline, the larger beauty walks in 11 shops across the country will be tested and if this is successful the following year will be taken to more shops.
The investment takes place in beauty while supermarkets are looking for ways to fill racks once used for TVs, microwaves and homeware.
Sainsbury’s says that it will double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000 products, which will for the first time include trades such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing series of L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees will also find more space with trademark-specific areas similar to those seen in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also launches its Boutique-grimming series again so that the majority of products are vegagan-friendly -- something that increasingly younger buyers are demanding.
In addition, the perfume retailer, The Fragrance Shop, will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the last of which opened in Croydon in South London and a second which will open later this year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Internet shopping and a move to smaller quantities of food purchased daily at local convenience stores means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive officer of Sainsbury's, said that the shops are going to look more like department stores when the supermarket tries to fight back against Aldi and Lidl's disposal stores with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's put Argos sales points in hundreds of shops and also announced a number of Habitat sales points since it bought back two years both these chains, which, according to their hardware sales, strengthened and made the purchases more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint company with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after an argument about how the profits from the pharmacy should be distributed within its shops.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's three years ago sold his 281-store pharmacy business for £125m to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
It says Lloyds will play a part in the plan by offering a wide range of luxury hair care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Director of Commerce, said: "We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our beauty walks to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in special-educated colleagues who will be in favour of providing advice.
Our series of trade names have been designed to meet every need and the attractive environment and comfortable locations means that we are now a territorial beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'fighting' after Holly Willoughby withdraws a £11 million deal
Dragons Den-ster Peter Jones ran away 'in anger' after TV provider Holly Willoughby withdrew her agreement to a £11 million with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home-dressing and casualty trade name, True,.
The couple’s business was compared to Gwynet Paltrow’s Goop trade name.
This morning's provider, 37, announced on Instagram that she had withdrawn her.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den-ster Peter Jones angry at the last moment by withdrawing their profitable lifestyle brand business - to focus on her own huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Source says that Jones was "rage" when TV's golden girl Tuesday at a tense meeting in the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new opportunities -- worth up to £1.5 million -- meant that she could no longer spend enough time on their home-dressing and accessibility trade name, True.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name and would, according to Integrated Willoughby, double the estimated £11 million fortune.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she had left True, Jones climbed a beam and traded Britain for one of his holiday homes.
A source says, "Truly was Holly's greatest priority far away.
It would be her long - term future that would pass through the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw her was absolutely stupid.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday was so close to the announcement.
There's a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters right to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the This Morning provider, one of Britain’s stars that makes most money flow, the firm can hunt millions out of the bag as a result of the enormous investment in products ranging from kissings and candles to clothing and household clothes, and the possibility that its announcement may even encounter more delays.
And that can mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin has been near Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby set up True in 2016 with Capp and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples have a holiday together and Jones has a 40 percent share in Baldwin's TV production firm.
Willoughby will become an M&S trademark ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the provider of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A well near Jones last night said, "We will not comment on his business."
Hard words 'and then we fall in love'
He laughed about criticism he's going to get from the news media because he made a remark that some would view as "unpresidency" and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his "News Reader's Voice".
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first conversation in June in Singapore as a major step towards the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament have burned down.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, said on Saturday, more than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, to leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North did not see a "consistent reaction" by the US at North Korea's early disarmament activities.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues with sanctions imposed on maintaining the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic stand in his convention talk.
"Our progress is excellent with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to start a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He says that his efforts to improve relationships with Kim have produced positive results — ending firefighting tests, helping to free hostages, and causing the rest of American soldiers to be returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach to descriptions of relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be Presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to come in this full arena, we'd have almost 200 people standing there," Trump said as he pointed out to the crowd right before him.
Gulf and Earthquake in Indonesia Destroys Island, Kill Hundreds
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs have said they are not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok's population has been eradicated, no national disaster has been announced, a prerequisite for catalysing international aid.
"In many cases they were unfortunately very clear that they did not ask for international help, which made it a bit difficult," I said.
Although Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu, it is not sure whether foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials are assisting the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given the ongoing earthquake in Indonesia, the country is sadly weak in preparation for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, it is not a common face to other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami alert in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, even though it was a warning of force.
It is at its best challenging to travel between many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to deal with earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Yoko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia's frowned upon infrastructure a turning point in his election campaign and has lost money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Yoko’s administration is driven by fundraising deficits as he sees reelection next year.
Mr. Yoko is also facing the pressure of crushing sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands of people were displaced, such as Christian and Muslim gangs fighting in the streets with spears, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Liverpool Daniel Sturridge shot a good equal to Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London from a Premierliga loss against Chelsea for a purpose in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri told Sturridge when he was about 30 years away from the Chelsea goal and his team was 1-0 behind.
He typed the ball to the left before reaching the target.
The attempt swam high over the frame as it swam to the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball faded over a jumping Kepa Arizabalaga and in the mere case.
"It was just to try to get in that position, to get on the ball, and players like Shaq always play ahead as much as possible, so I just tried to make as much time as possible for myself," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and once typing and not too much thought about it and just spit."
Chelsea was about 1-0 before the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues target shooter played in that playground with a backdrop back to Mateo Kovacic before he landed near the middle field and landed in the Liverpool-Half.
Kovacic quickly received and reported in the middle field.
With a beautiful forward-spin he then led to Hazard in the frame.
Hazard crossed the defense and ended up with a left foot-spin past Liverpool's Alison Becker in the far end.
Liverpool conducts the battle against Naples on Wednesday at the group stage of the Champions League at Stadium San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea comes to London on Thursday at 3 nm in the UEFA Europa League for Videoton.
Additional climb to 832 after Indonesian tsunamis
The death toll in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami had risen to 832, the country’s disaster agency said early Sunday.
It has been reported that many people have been caught under the rubble of buildings that caused the earthquake, which struck Friday at an amount of 7.5, and caused fires of up to 20 feet, said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho to a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 people, was polluted with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a man, 32, suspected of murder after the death of a woman
A murder investigation was sent from stacks after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 a.m. in Grayson Mews in John Street with knives, and a 32-year-old man was arrested suspected of murder.
The police encouraged people in the area that had heard or seen anything to move forward.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: ‘The investigation is at an early stage but I appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on Dashcam film material, to contact us as they may have information that can be indispensable to our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon friends who believe they know the woman at the scene came up to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are continued because the police have said they are in the process of educating the victim’s neighbors.
A taxi driver who lived in Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment but was informed by the police that no one was allowed into or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now told that it will take hours before they are released.
It has been heard that a police officer tells one man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears on the scene.
She repeatedly said, ‘ It’s so disgusting. ’
At 2 nm there were two police cars inside the cordon with another car just outside.
A number of officials were placed inside the cordon to monitor the block housing.
Anyone with information is asked to connect @MerPolCC to DM, 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 with log 247 of 30 September as reference.
Parliament's Statute of Cromwell is the most recent memorial with a 'rewrite of history' dispute
His banning would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "insanity" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statutes that the shape of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The imagery of the English Civil Wars was also ordered and carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Thomas in the past century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's manipulative depiction of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th century's opinion and part of the history of a figure that many still believe to be memorable.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is the subject of continued historical debate.
What is determined is that the conflict of the middle 17th century gave shape to the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individual recognizable figure representing one side of that separation.
His success as Protector is also worthy of celebration and remembrance."
Murder Guard Chinese Farmer
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China.
The man, identified only by his side, "Yuan", was found dead with a cut-off slaughter with blood covered near a hook at the market in Liapanshui in the Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares on 30 May 2005 to inject pigs with explosives at a pig farm in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports on Wednesday, he traveled with his cousin of the neighbor Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his nephew found him dead and found a door to a neighbor's pighouse.
He said there was a great male pig in the hole with blood on his back.
A forensic investigation confirmed, according to the report, that the 550-pound pig killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bleeding and torn," said the cousin, who was called on her from, "Wu," quoted the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera film material showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4.40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man does not belong to Yuan or his nephew.
A market manager told the Evening New that the pig was closed to prevent it from attacking someone else, while the police gathered evidence on the scene.
Yuan’s family and the branding companies negotiated a claim to compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs that have been reported by people have already been reported.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with critical injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig caught a Wallian farmer on his tractor until his wife scared the animal out.
After a farmer from Oregon was fed by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "faster".
"They're just playful.
They're picky, very curious... they're not about to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Rest of Orcaan Rosa will bring widespread heavy rain to the southwest U.S.A.
As foretold, weak Orcaan Rosa moves as it moves over the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring floodwaters across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane, and was placed 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa Sunday is expected to move north.
Meanwhile, a movement on the Pacific begins to take shape and move east to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa Monday approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to drive heavy tropical humidity north-west U.S.
Rosa will bring Monday rain from up to 10 inches in parts of Mexico.
Then tropical humidity in response to the approaching fluctuation over the coming days will bring widespread heavy rainfalls in the southwest.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous kite flows, waste, and possibly landfalls in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause place-place rainfalls of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially about the largest parts of Arizona.
Kitts are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions because of the widespread nature of tropical rains.
It would be extremely unwise to venture into the desert with the danger of tropical rains.
Heavy rains can cause deep - mud desert rivers to fall and thunderstorms to bring heavy local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching drought will bring a little local heavy rain to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Rainfall totals of more than half a inch are possible, which can cause low waste flow and smooth reefs.
This will be the region’s first rainy season of the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rainforests will allow Arizona to start Sunday and early Monday before the rain allows Monday and Tuesday to spread more widely.
Heavy rain will spread from Tuesday to the Four Corners and last until Wednesday.
October can see intense temperature fluctuations across the U.S. as the North Pole cools, but the troops remain warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central United States is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, countless summer heat will try to increase and expand again.
It is expected that large parts of the central and eastern U.S. will start warm October, with widespread 80s from the Southern Plain to parts of the northeast.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a higher chance at average temperatures for the Eastern US for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people see Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million people watched Thursday on six television networks at the impressive testimony of High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christian Blazey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that had occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political point of death continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programs for Friday's on-the-spot: an agreement made by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh had drunk her and tried to get her clothes out at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a heart - wrenching witness, said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company counted average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to measure people who look at offices.
To put it in perspective, it's a hearing as big as one for a decisive football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose spokesperson strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, was all the networks ahead with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest was still high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderated Republican office issued a statement that he was going to vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was arrested on Friday morning at CNN and CBS, where heavyweights were shouting at him when he tried to take a lift to a Judicial Committee.
He stood a few minutes with his eyes lowered, while CNN was living as he was being beaten.
"I'm right here for you," said one woman.
"Do you think he tells the country the truth?
He was told, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and went before the elevator door, said he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks all covered hours later alive when the Judicial Committee would vote for Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he'd only do it with the understanding that the FBI would look at the charges against the candidate for the next week, as the Democratic minority requested.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the vote to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British EM May accuses critics of 'political games' about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has criticised her plans to leave the European Union, accused of "political gambling" with Britain's future and of undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's First Minister Theresa May is on 29 September 2018 for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the paper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued with his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal that Britain and the EU should promote each other's prices was "all ridiculous".
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested on a second-degree murder charge, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials posted a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said Sims lost his glasses during the riot.
The police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on it, reports CBS affiliated WAFB.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said he recognized that he had killed Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, reported the lawyer.
On Friday, the Court of Justice of East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head of the neck.
The department commends the Louisiana State Police's continuing task force, the state police's crime lab, Southern University police and district citizens for their assistance with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Alleva thanks to territorial law enforcement for his "zeal and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-six foreplayer grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for LSU basketball.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 leaps per match.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade told the team to "beat" and "in shock" about Wayde's death.
"That's what you're worried about," said Wayde.
Volcanic as in Mexico City
As sprayed from the Popocatepeti volcano reached the southern neighborhood of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican Saturday to stay away from the volcano after picking up activity in the crater and recording over 24 hours 183 gas and ace releases.
The center monitors numerous vibrations and vibrations.
Social media images showed how thin low - gas motor screens near Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, were covered.
Geophysics marked an increase in activity at the volcano, which sat 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatist for the celebration of independence vote
Six people were arrested on Saturday in Barcelona after protesting pro-independence witnesses with riot police, and thousands joined in protests to commemorate the first commemoration of Catalonia’s polarizing vote for dismissal.
A group of masked pro-separatists held back by the riot police, they suffocated with eggs and threw powder paint that caused dark dust clouds in streets that usually flow from tourists.
A bootie also broke out later in the day, and the police had to use their buttons to keep the fight going.
In a few hours' time, pro-independence groups sang "No forget, no forgiveness" in confrontation with the unionist's cry of "Long Live Spain".
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries caused in the interventions reported the local press.
The tension continues to run high in the independence-oriented region one year after the October 1st referendum by Madrid was seen as illegal but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters voted overwhelmingly to become independent, but the participation was low, with those who mostly scored the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent the vote at the polling stations across the region from continuing.
Pro-independence groups camped on Friday night to prevent a campaign in support of the national police.
The campaign continued but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist occupation with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful for the prospect that Catalonia would gain independence.
"Last year we went through one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they could vote but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite a vital yet narrow win in regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have been difficult to maintain this year's moment, with many of their most famous leaders either in self-imposed exile or in detention in advance for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who took the campaign in support of the police on his phone, says the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pretrial detention since last year, announced that he will be in the European Parliament elections next year.
"To stand as a candidate for European elections is the best way to reject the decline in democratic values and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested for driving against home February
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after a car had repeatedly been arrested against a house in Londonderry.
The incident unfolded at about 19:30 BST on Thursday in Ballynagardsingel.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the fences and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been shot at a stage in the car.
Menga objective gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston assures victory
Enhanced Livigston amazed Rangers to turn Steven Gerrard to his second defeat in 18 matches as a driver of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga’s goal was evidence of the difference when Gary Holt’s team moved to second with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team stayed in the prime minister's season without leaving and came to meet the predecessors of Heart, who were eight points ahead.
Rangers are first Thursday host to Rapid Vienna in the European league.
Meanwhile, Livingston spread their unarmed loppie into the division to six matches, with Chief Captain Holt who has still not tasted a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston plays odds against bot visitors
Holt's team had to run ahead long before they scored a goal, with their round chest that Rangers got all kinds of problems on their necks.
SR broke through, but turned ahead of the target corner, then ALL could play wide only after he got closer and met CH’s head across the target corner.
The hosts were content to have Rangers play before them, knowing that they could get the visitors with deadly moments.
And so the ultimate goal came.
Rangers set off a puzzle and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson giving Menga the chance to dig and draw a target from the middle of the window.
By that time Rangers had dominated but could not push through the domestic defense, and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unconcerned.
That pattern was continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos had forced a coup from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was rejected by the feet of Rangers' target guard Allan McGregor and Lithgow had a wide-ranging typing to avoid yet an open game of Livingston.
Crosses have repeatedly reached and reversed Livingston’s frame, while two sentences — after Halkett’s challenge by replacement Glenn Middleton and one for handball — have been dismissed.
Livingston’s Phenomenal – Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont by Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal games and scores for Livingston.
Until the last man was outstanding; they still exceed expectations on this upward course.
Their style of play and team have been almost unchanged since their return to high school, but much honor comes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was huge with his manly defense arrangements, while Menga kept up with Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they were at times under Gerard, they could not keep those standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once could they push through the domestic team, which is a bit of a call for Rangers, who found them in the middle division.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
There was Saturday (September 29) smiling and blue air when leaders from Turkey and Germany in Berlin met for breakfast.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which had to restore relations between NATO allies.
They had an outcome on issues involving human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan was then assigned to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police quoted security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters then appeared to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan combatants – many of their Kurds – also made their voices loud and both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The controversial remarks reflect the division of a visitor who is greeted by some German Turks as heroes and obtained by others as autocrat.
Deptford road accident: Cycling dies in a collision with a motor
A bicycle driver died in a collision in London involving a car.
The collision took place about 10:15 BST near the connection of Beswood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics were present, but the man died on the scene.
The collision came months after another bike driver died in a hit-and-run in Children Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident took place.
The Metropolitan Police reported that officials were working to identify the man and whitewash his neighbors.
Roadblocks and bus routes were suggested instead, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six guards injured in protest
Six guards were injured in a riot at a high-security prison, the prison said.
On Sunday, about 09:30 BST broke out and was still running at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist "Tornado Guards" has been called upon to handle the rebellion, which includes eight prisoners and is limited to one wing.
The guards were treated on the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesperson said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to pay attention to a continued incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and can remain behind bars any longer."
HMP Long Martin has housed more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the chief of the prison received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officials were called upon to pay attention to serious disturbances during which staff were attacked with billiards.
Orkaan Rosa Treig Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Kitsflude (Drug Areas Maybe Advantage)
It's unusual for a tropical low pressure to hit Arizona but it's exactly what can happen early next week when Orcaan Rosa's remaining energy moves over the southwest desert and carries kites flow risks.
The National Valuable Service has already issued kite flood wakes for Monday and Tuesday for West Arizona to south and east Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa Tuesday will take a direct route over Phoenix, and by Monday will bring rain.
The National Valuation Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status since 1950 within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was an hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The National Orcaan Centre’s models predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated quantities of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon border of Arizona.
Other parts of the Southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Come, are likely to get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals of up to 4 inches.
For those outside kite flood risk, Rosa’s rain will likely be a blessing, since the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, this rainfall will likely be beneficial, since the southwest is now experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drug Monitor, only over 40 percent of Arizona experience extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, Orkaan Rosa’s path leads to a land approach around the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, always on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 85 miles an hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at 12 miles an hour.
The storm opposes cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore weakens its power.
So it is expected that his Monday afternoon or evening will reach the country against tropical storms in Mexico.
Rainfalls on parts of Mexico can be heavy and present a significant flood risk.
" rainfalls of 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California to the northwest Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then, as a tropical storm north over Mexico, move before it Tuesday in the early morning of Arizona as a tropical depression and then move through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The greatest danger expected of Rosa is a very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the US southwest," said the National Orcaan Centre.
It is expected that this rain may cause life - threatening floods and floods in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys a 20-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset.
The injured teenage son was found on Saturday about 04:00 BST in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital where he is still in a "stable" state.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old, and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officials have appealed to anyone who may have any cell phone footage of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh that 'he's under the community, the anger' of the Democratic Party
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "was under the community, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed Thursday before the Congress and fervently and emotionally denied a claim by Christine Blazey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed her claim at the hearing.
The president said Saturday the Americans saw "the brilliance and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most capable legal minds of our time, a jurist with a pure record of public service," he told the crowds of West Virginia's supporters.
The president referred directly to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican appearance at the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
I don't stand, but actually I stand," he said.
That's why I fight everywhere for these candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are on a mission to "stand up and prevent."
The first important procedural vote on the Senate floor over Kavanaugh's nomination is expected not to take place later than Friday, a senior GOP leader told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths due to Indonesian shaking, tsunamis, with still increasing numbers
At least 384 people were dead and many washed away when huge waves broke down on the beaches when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday in the city of Palu on the beach for a festival on the beach when firemen from up to six feet (18 m) broke high against the sun on the beach, washed away many after their death, and destroyed everything that was in the way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-scale earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not run immediately and they became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency GNPB said during an information session in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come on its own, it brought cars, trunks, houses together, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said and added that the tsunami moved over the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed trees to jump free of the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photos released by the disaster scene show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges torn down and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks shook the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes have been felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's agency for the evaluation and application of technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released by Friday's giant explosion was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which sits at the tip of a long, narrow bay, could have exacerbated the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "probably" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
Bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the accidents and damage can be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Dongala which is close to the earthquake.
Communication "is completely blocked with no information" from Donghala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday because they did not report that a tsunami hit Palu, although officials said that the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur imaging material shared on social media, it can be heard a man on the top floor of a building calling out desperate warnings about the coming tsunamis to the people down the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water will hit the beach and willow buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately explain the image material.
The shaking and tsunami caused major power cuts that cut down communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but explorers still needed food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport is only reopened for aid efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo would visit the Palu detachment centers on Sunday.
Indonesia-Tsoenami mortality rates rise to over 800.
That is very bad.
Although World Vision staff from Donghala arrived safely in Palu City where workers were hiding in shelters set up in their office’s courtyard, they were on their way to a scene of destruction, Mr. Dosseva said.
They told me that they had seen many houses destroyed," he said.
That is very bad.
Even while relief groups are starting with the dire task of launching the disaster relief team, some people complained that foreign relief workers are being prevented from traveling to Palu with much experience.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, stocks, and personnel from overseas may begin only after the disaster area has been declared nationally.
It has not yet happened.
"It is still a disaster on a provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, "Well, it's a national disaster," we can open it up for international assistance, but it doesn't have a status yet."
With the arrival of the second night at Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of those still missing hope to be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad stories of natural disasters.
Saturday, a little boy was taken out of a sewer pipe.
On Sunday, rescue workers saved a woman for two days under the rubble were stuck with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the founder of the Indonesian national battalion team, had two of the missing battalion weaves cut off for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in the fall-screen weaving field I had my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon tells how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel on social media circulated under the fallscreen weaving community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages were only answered with one gray mark, instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Stealing $26,750 while refilling OTM at Newport on the Livee
The thieves stole $26,750 on Friday morning from a Brink's worker who refilled an OTM at Newport on the Livee, according to a news report from the Newport Police Station.
The car driver was emptying an OTM in a entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more money, investigator Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press statement.
While he was busy, another man came "from behind the Brink's employee" and stole the money that had to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses had seen several suspicions fleeing from the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities needs to contact Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will change his name — to Ye
With the announcement of the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "The beings were formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has for a long time been the nickname Ye and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to announce his new Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande on the program that had cancelled for "emotional reasons," said the program’s manufacturer.
In addition to the fact that it is an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has in the past said that the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year when he discussed his album title with radio provider Big Boy.
"As I am you, I am us, it is us.
It was from Kanye, which means the only one, only Ye — just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of famous rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs was known among others as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
A former West co-worker, JAY-Z, has also come up with or without a link and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO promises not to use force against civilians
Mexican newly elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, in the process of commemorating the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody revenge against students, promised never to use military power against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use the force to control the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, soldiers shot at a peaceful demonstration in the plaza where up to 300 people died at a time when left-wing student movements were posted throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of training opportunities drew the youth to bands.
U.S. needs to double KI funding
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount spent on research in this field, investors and KI-practice Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple, said.
The comments come after several parts of the U.S. government have made KI announcements, even recently the U.S. is a complete formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China announced their plan last year: to be the No. 1 in KI innovation by 2030.
"Double the KI research budget will be a good start, giving all the other countries so far behind the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in KI," Lee said.
The duplication of funding could double the chances that the next big KI performance will be achieved in the US, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Sinovation Ventures, which has been posted in one of the most prominent KI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on a KI system that hit the highest-ranking American Othello player and later was a management officer at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. technology competitions, such as the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotic challenge and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the following visionary years.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government seats, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes away the academic leaders; it's the corporate west," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have appointed influential individuals from other universities to work at KI.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help to assist the US's KI efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhDs in KI," he said.
In July 2017, China’s State Council issued their next Generation of Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence established a joint centre for artificial intelligence aimed at involving business and academic world friends and the White House announced the formation of a Committee of Crafts on artificial intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, it currently costs more than $100 million a year in KI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been under fire for months.
Macedonians agree to change their country's name
The people of Macedonia voted Sunday in a referendum on whether to change their name to "Republic of North Macedonia", an act that would solve a decade-old dispute with Greece that blocked its membership boats for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbour's name represents a claim in the area and has refused their admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments entered into an agreement in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Macedonian Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign doubted whether the rise would meet the minimum 50 per cent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot read: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued that it is a price that can be paid to seek permission for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, for it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough parliamentarians have said that they will accept the outcome of the vote to decide.
The name change will require a second party to the parliament.
The state’s electoral commission said there were no reports of irregularities by 1 nm.
However, the rise was then only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonia's EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko deliver their voices for the referendum in Macedonia on the change of the country's name that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
Before the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small increase and drew chairs closer to tents set up by those who were going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads up, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I think the great majority will be in favour of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he gave his voice.
He said a "yes" statement would be "confirming our future."
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will take part in the referendum – less than the required amount.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said that they would vote.
For the referendum to be successful, the increase must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A return to the referendum will be the first serious return to the policy of a pro-western government since the government took over last May.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates throughout Brighton defense for purpose
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling removed the Brighton defense from the road in Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it ridiculously easy during his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine goalkeeper received an indication at the beginning of the series.
He chased between three Brighton defenders through before he hit the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green hems.
He crossed by one defender before he crossed several others on the edge of the Brighton target.
He then pushed a few to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English prosecutor used his first touch in the corner to send back the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to hit the Brighton-targeter Matthew Ryan with a spear to the right side of the net.
"Aguero has trouble with problems with his feet," said the city manager Pep Guardiola to a journalist.
"We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We are happy that he signed up for a purpose at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premierliga fight.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero at that game got the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He sent a beautiful ball next to the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had some contact before he led Sterling to the far end.
The Sky Blue’s foreman shot the ball in the net just before he was over the back.
City take Hoffenheim in Kampioeneliga Tuesday at 12:55 am by Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Screams want to play against Rockies
With the Nationals who are out of the game, there's not much reason to force another start.
But on Sunday, the ever-competing Scherzer wants to accept the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still play implications for the Rockies, which has a one-off match over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the UK West.
The Rockies won at least a promo election with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday morning, but still wants to determine their first division title.
"Although we play for nothing, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level from any point of me will look in the face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to take part in it?"
The Nationals still have to announce their first player for Sunday, but it is reportedly favorable to put Scherser in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will begin his 34th, had a throw-in session Thursday and will play on his normal Sunday rest.
Washington right-handed is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 extracts in 220 2/3 turns this season.
Trump holding conventions in West Virginia
The president directly referred to the situation around his High Court election Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican appearance in the medium - term elections.
"All we've done is in the game in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
It's one of the big, big – I'm not standing, but I'm actually standing, and that's why I fight for these candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump went on, "You see this disgusting, disgusting radical group of Democrats, you see it happening now.
And now they are determined to take back the power by any means possible; one sees the community, the ignorance.
They don't care for those who cause them harm, on whom they must run, for power and rule; that is what they want, power and strength, and we won't give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "stand up and stop."
"And one sees it over the last four days," he said, and called the Democrat "quad and common and disgusting and false."
He referred in the name to the Senate’s judicial committee’s high - ranking Diana Feinstein, who received severe beatings from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Do you want to reload the file?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting for one – it was really weak body language – the weakest body language I've ever seen."
Workers' Party is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant to those who say what they think
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to put me under the sun, it wasn't exactly a surprise.
After all, I'm the last person in a string of Workers Party LPs to be told that we're not welcome – all because we said what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she stood up fearlessly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me for being different from Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, ironically enough similar issues that Jeremy differed with previous leaders.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Workers Party LP, it was exactly what Friday’s AR meetings were.
Unfortunately, it is not today the show of many meetings, and the promise of "friendlyr, more favorable" politics is long forgotten, if ever it has begun.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated within the Workers ’ Party, and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable for the leadership of the party.
It began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had previously shared similar political views, began to expect me to make a U-turn and adopt positions that I would never otherwise agree with – whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public -- and it doesn't really matter what I say -- there's a lot of sign language on social media that asks me not to be re-elected, to reject politics from the core, and to tell me that I shouldn't be in the Workers' Party.
And that is not just my experience.
Actually, I am happier than my colleagues because the comments I was directed to are tending to be police.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of sexual or racist insults every day, but never shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Workers' Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church, and with every "mission of mistrust" or change of selection rules, some become more difficult.
I had much advice for the past two years that encouraged me to stay under the radar, not to be so pronounced, and then I would be "okay."
But I did not take part in politics to do so.
Since I joined the Workers Party 32 years ago, encouraged by the neglect of the Thatcher government that literally dropped my state high school, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most — whether as a local council member or as a minister of government.
I never hid my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused about my political positions and areas where I differ from the present leadership.
To those who presented the motion on Friday, I can only say that with the country that sends a Brexit to damage all households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Workers' Party.
But the one message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my electors, or they are now members of the Workers' Party anyway: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no amount of threats from not being re-elected or political benefits will prevent me from doing what I believe is best for all of you.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose — Honorable Father above
Two late three may have pulled the final outcome slightly, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this wonderfully entertaining Tennant's Premiery contest of the day.
They are now at the top of the target leather, the only unarmed team of ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better odds, that carried the home team, and teacher Peter Murchie had every right to be content.
"We have so far been tested in our fights and we are still unarmed, so I must be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, "honor Ayr, they took their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, which was destined by Frazier Climo, made Air ahead, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, who was made available for the war by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to count the numbers and Jason Baggot scored an unintended three.
Climo increased Air's advance with a penalty head, just before he, just before rest a solo triad aimed to make it rest 17-5 for Air.
But Melrose began the second half well, and Patrick Anderson’s three, doomed by Baggot, reduced the backbone to five points.
There was a long recollection of a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott that was carried down on a portable one, and from the beginning Ayr increased the lead with a Stafford McDowall-three, haunted by Climo.
Air's observer Captain Blair Macpherson then found a yellow card and again Melrose used the extra player with an unspoilt three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a lot of pressure.
The home team made a return, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he had killed for Climo without the ball, and from the penal station MacPherson pushed the ball to death after the next Ayr ransom.
Climo swallowed it up, until he had also done almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe had found David Armstrong's target head and flanged Gregor Henry away for the fifth of the household crew.
Still Game star looks like he's going to take a new career in restaurant business
It seems that the Still Game star will move to the hospitality business after it has been discovered that he has been appointed the director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays with old comedy friend Greg Hemphil.
The duo announced that the next ninth season would be the final of the program, and Kiernan seemed to be preparing for life in Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Agingmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment, although a source at the Scottish Sun sucked which would involve Kiernan at Glasgow's "floating restaurant business".
'The sea is ours': country- surrounded Bolivia hope court will reopen away to the Pacific
Matrose patrols a masked fleet in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a blue flag.
Fleet bases from Titicaca More to the Amazon are filled with the slogan: "The sea is right ours.
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout the countryside Bolivia is the memory of the coastline that they lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century — still fresh — the need to reinvigorate the Pacific.
That hope is probably the highest it has been in decades, while Bolivia is awaiting a verdict by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of talks.
"Bolivia has the moment, the spirit of unity and peace, and of course expects the outcome with a positive attitude." said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the IGH statement on large screens across the country, hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will find in favor of Bolivia's claim that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate to Bolivia to give a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president -- who next year faces a controversial struggle for re-election -- also has many that depend on Monday's verdict.
"We are near to return to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court in Bolivia will decide in favor — and that it will change little if it did.
The Dutch-based UN body has no power to recognise Chilean territory, and has speculated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH's statement comes to the last six months only shows that the case "was not complicated," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than helping Bolivia’s case, the past four years may have slowed it down.
"The issue of access to the sea was purchased by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morale’s aggressive rhetoric exposed any remaining Chilean kindness, indicating it.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to engage in harmful conversations.
In 1962, the two countries were finally replaced by ambassadors.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was extremely rapid.
Monday will give Bolivia an "extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of differences with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America's most popular presidents – used the seafaring issue as a political crusade.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The verdict is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't come unless they can trust the U.S.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his country would never first disarm their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He appealed to the United States to fulfill the promises made at a meeting in Singapore between the leaders of competing countries.
His remarks to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are apparently on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which reached a dead point, more than three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "dream image" that continued sanctions and U.S. capsity to a declaration that ended the Korean War will also bring the North to its knees.
Washington is careful to agree to the declaration without first taking significant steps to disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second consultation.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about making a distance from an arsenal that the country considers the only way to guarantee their security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris fashion shows reveal newest series of major headlines on the way to the shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely reject the sun, you do not need to seek further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have published a series of oversized lead covers at their SS19 collection on the treadmill that fascinated the style of Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely unpractice, this summer’s Instagram passed, and these designers staged their amazing creations over the course of time.
The bleacher by Valentino was a huge beige hat with a fourfold edge that penetrated the models' heads.
Other major events included waffles decorated with jewelry, a water heater and even a pineapples – but it is not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also announced a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had elaborate lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than leather couture.
One creature looked like a shriveled piece of equipment, with a snorkel and a dipper's eye, while another appeared like a melted room horn.
And if you continue the great fashion, it is your happy day.
Stylish viewers predict that the huge guard may be on the way to the shops near you.
The oversized guard follows briefly on the heels of 'La Bomba', the stretcher hat with a two-foot wide edge seen on all its heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat spread over social media has sent another great creation over the course – a stretchy beach bag that was almost as big as the swimwear model it wore.
The burnt orange raffiasac, finished with raffia frying and finished a white leather handle on the top, stood out at Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Known style Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see large coats and beach bags in shops for the next summer – since the designer has made such a big impact that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for large futures.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a range of academic excellence achievements, and it continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which has only been reinforced by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community companies.
With over 30,000 schools throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their schools and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career, and their position as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we see that world languages continue as a popular and desirable class in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If thou speak with him in thy own tongue, it shall reach unto his heart.
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exams, we can see that languages are above the league tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages achieved a high grade A.
The data, collected by SCIS' 74 member schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher A degree in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French and 63 of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young adults will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages now have the same reputation as the STEM (scientific, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in independent schools ’ curriculum and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Committee on Vocational and Vocational Training found in 2014 that 17 percent of the reasons that workers provide for their difficulty in filling posts are attributed to a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are becoming more and more important to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more likely employment opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that a person chooses, if he learns a second language, he will have a real benefit in the future with such a lifelong skill.
To communicate directly with people from other countries, a multilingual person will automatically be placed above the competition.
According to a YouTube survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to engage in a conversation and France was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That is why it is now so important to teach today’s children the language.
To know a number of languages, especially those of developing economies, children will have a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will teach what is considered necessary for the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It cannot be recognized at this stage, in a global business environment, that languages are still of great importance to the country's future, and therefore it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages must really be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and excellence to Scotland’s young people.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make Sunday debut for San Diego Lakers
The watch is almost over for supporters to see how LeBron James makes his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in San Diego in Sunday's pre-season opening game against the Denver Nuggets.
But just how many minutes he's going to play, it still has to be determined.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell has protested that James will probably play a limited amount of time.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers ’ six games in the preseason program.
"I didn't need pre-season competition at this stage in my career," he said.
Trump's West Virginia convention, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a flagship election in Wheeling, West Virginia, tonight.
It is Trump’s first of five scheduled collections next week, including stops at friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmatory vote now held for his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming interim election because the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress when voting in November.
How late is Trump's collection in West Virginia tonight, and how do you look online?
Trump's collection in Wheeling, West Virginia, was scheduled for 7 nm. ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
Below you can look at Trump’s collection in West Virginia through live streaming.
Trump will probably pay attention to this week's hearings for the appointed High Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who became tense about charges of sexual misconduct with an expected confirmatory vote held for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main point of view of this surplus is to help the republics facing difficult elections in November.
President Trump's campaign, therefore, said that the next week these five summaries were aimed at "visiting volunteers and supporters while Republicans were trying to protect and enlarge the majority they had in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The governor of Congress is so critical of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy field season," a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who refused to call his name, told Reuters.
Tonight's rally, arranged for the Wesbanco arena in Wheeling, can draw supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the media in Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the stamp.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a jump at the vocal bus," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Riderbecker 2018: The U.S. team shows that they have the courage to keep the hope alive when entering Sunday’s single game
After three one - sided sessions, the four - game teams of Saturday afternoon may only have needed this Driver’s Cup.
The swinging swing of momentum is a completely varied sport concept but one in which players believe wholeheartedly, and certainly in competitions like this.
Where, then, would they say that the moment is now?
"They ran with six points and now it's four, so we carry it as a little moment, I suppose," said Jordan Spieth when he ran away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points ahead, and twelve more that are being played.
The Americans feel, however, as Spieth says, that they have such a little wind in their sails and that there is much to encourage them, not least not the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth was mortal from the top to the clean ground and led by his example.
That score of celebration got harder as she advanced rounds and he lowered a critical set to win the match four completely alike while he and Thomas were after two rounds with two behind.
She sets up what the match on 15 won for them, is greeted with a similar scream, the kind that tells one that he believes the American team has another chance.
"You really just have to get it all out and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
That's all those players are missing now.
18 cups to print their stamp.
The only players who have scored more than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unquestionable story of the Riderbecker.
Europe’s unique but charming couple have gained four out of four and cannot do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't keep one on Saturday afternoon score, but they also kept one on Saturday morning score avoiding both during the last nine Friday mornings and during the last nine days.
That walk, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this vast crowd, confirms that they are the players to be hit on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who can tap a potential European victory when the sun is over Le Golf National.
Choose both at the same time or at different times.
However, it is too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short deals with Sergio Garcia, the morning’s four - wheeled hero, when he played with Alex Noren.
One held about the number of bean and two doubles on the front nine had the Spaniard and the Swede landed in a hole from which they could not even get near.
Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of your hole.
The four-balls and the four-game teams are so exciting to keep close watch because of the interaction between the couple, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way a strategy can change into an eyeball.
Europe has so far always played better as a team and on the last day has made significant progress, but this four-game session has also shown that the U.S. team has the courage to engage in the fight that some, especially at home, have doubted.
Europe runs 10-6 during the last day of the Rider cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after they have come from Saturday's four-ball and four-game games.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over a troubled Tiger Woods to take their count so far at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who was trying to maintain the trophy that they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, ruled an American team that performed unevenly in the morning's four-balls, so they won the 3-1 series.
The U.S. had more resistance in the four games and won two matches, but they did not allow the rearward to shrink.
Jim Furik’s team needed eight points from Sunday’s 12th single - game contest to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novel to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, called after a sensational weekend "Moliwood", are just the second pair in the history of the Riderbeker who scored four points after their first four races.
After they broke Woods and Patrick Reed into the four-balls, they played excellent together to win a Pope Woods and American novel Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5-4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes showed flashy brilliance, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours and sevens in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning's four-balls, came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the four-games to a 2&1 match for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kuepka--which is the first and third on the world rankings.
Europe, however, did not always get their sense on a pleasant day with a little wind southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth who won a great tournament three times and Justin Thomas put the mark on the Americans on Saturday with two points.
They scored a difficult 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 3&4 in the four games after they lost the first two wells.
Only twice in the history of the Rider-beaker has a team recovered from a backdrop of four points when they enter the single game, although Fury's team only have to play equally to keep the trophy because they already like it.
After two days of their second best, however, it doesn't seem like they'll be able to make an attack on Sunday.
North Korea says they'll "surely not" unilaterally untrustworthy.
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations Saturday that continued sanctions were exacerbating their mistrust of the United States and that the country would certainly not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally without such qualities.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had in recent years hit “significant welfare measures”, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, breaking down the nuclear test site and promising not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We see, however, no corresponding reaction from the US," he said.
"Without any confidence in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will certainly not disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "fascinated" approach to the removal of nuclear weapons, which would reward North Korea if it took steps, his words seemed significant because it did not unilaterally reject nuclear weapons unconditionally as Pjonjang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-Oen and Donald Trump at the very first summit between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June when Kim undertook to work for "the destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea wants a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted requests to weaken strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on the "destruction of nuclear weapons first" and exerts more pressure by intensifying the level of sanctions in order to achieve their goal in a coercive way, and even objecting to the 'declaration of the end of the war'," said Ri.
"The perception that sanctions can force us on our knees is a dream of the people who are unknown to us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are exacerbating our mistrust."
Ri said nothing about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader had previously set up at the United Nations during the week.
Instead, the minister focused on three meetings during the past five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and added: "If the party in this issue were South Korea nuclear weapons destruction and not the US, the destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end."
Still, Ri's speech was dramaticly different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's firearms would be directed to the U.S. land mass after "Mr. Evil President" Trump for Kim called a "firearmman" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year to "completely destroy North Korea," Kim richly praised for his courage for taking steps to disarm, but he said that much work still needs to be done and that sanctions should remain there until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for this, and said, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps they have taken.
However, U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said Thursday to the UN Security Council: "Implementation of sanctions by the Security Council should continue to be rigorous and uninterrupted until we realize the complete, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unilaterally stepped up sanctions against North Korea in an effort to raise funding for Pjonjang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and later said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo had already visited North Korea this year three times, but his last trip there did not go well.
He left Pjonjang in July and said that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him only hours later of making "debt demands."
In a meeting with Moon, North Korea has promised to break off a missile base and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes "consistent measures".
He said Kim told him that the "consistent measures" he wanted to see are security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students follow a course over enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year makes all its pre-graduate students sleep more in an effort to study the growing macho culture by working against coffee-driven 'full-night sessions'.
An academic found that students at the world’s top university are often insensitive when it comes to the basic principles of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after he gave a talk about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
'At the end of that one girl approached me and said, 'Why do they tell me this first, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had yet told her how important sleep was--which surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, offered this year for the first time, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleeping habits help academic and athletic performance as well as how it improves their general well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after it was found that students were seriously asleep during the week.
The hourly course includes some interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a bedroom, where students need to click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes and books to tell about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleeplessness and the importance of a sleeping trip.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer can increase.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know it won't change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know--just as you have the right to know the health effect of choosing to smoke cigarettes," added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride to 'do all night study' still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
To make sure that you get enough sleep of good quality, a student's 'secret weapon' should be to avoid stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said--even to avoid it to put on weight, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a hunger mode, which makes you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiar studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course after he passed one of his classes last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to perform a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the institution where people compete with one another.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students consider setting up an alarm for when they are going to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and being aware of the harmful effect of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm and make it difficult to reach the sheep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal of Menga Overcoming Gerard’s Men
Rangers experienced another sarcasm when Dolly Menga's target head Steven Gerrard's unmatched team had a 1-0 drop.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first as visitors since February's 4-1 victory at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team was only awarded to Gerrard in his second run in 18 competitions so that his team was eight points behind Hearts, which ran loose in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before rest, and it didn't seem like a Rangers team would play without much inspiration.
As Rangers now fall to the sixth position, Livingstone climbs to the third and is only behind the hibernian on target.
And there may be further difficulty for Rangers after the border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object appears to have been thrown from the side of the road.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that stormed over Ayr after the final battle of the Betfred cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that last week took a point of Hearts and he would have been in his nuptials in the way that his well-trained team snorted their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
In fact, after just two minutes, they had to score when Menga’s first release to Scott Pittman passed on Allan McGregor’s goal, but the middle - class player opened up his big chance.
A deep chill by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense mate Alan Lithgow could only miss a shot at the rear end of the target.
Rangers took control, but it seemed that there was more hope than belief in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he had to get a penalty at the quarter-point when he and Steven Lawless met, but the divorce judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get only two shots to the target during the first half, but the former Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly was seriously beaten by Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and an easy target head of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi’s opener at the last 34 minutes may have been against the direction of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it, even though it is only for their hard work.
Rangers never handled a deep system of Jacobs again.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool and sent it to Menga for a simple round.
Gerrard acted at the break when he ran Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had an almost immediate impact when the plane sent to Morelos but the impressive Kelly of his strike chased to the block.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett, which had long ball after long ball.
Holt’s team could have increased their lead in the last stages, but McGregor got up well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow could get in from the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a penaltyhead when he got through with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our "Sunday morning" German: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and WE TELL MORE ... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has been a pillar of science, and it has also become a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950's Rollprint "Bells of Coronado," in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans have played:
Man: "What is this on earth?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you set up these envelopes, you can even hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Good, it's cracking around now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer can learn the immune system to see predator cells
New cancer can learn the immune system to see and kill predator cells
Distant teaches immune system to identify predator cells as part of treatment
Method involves removing immune cells from a patient, changing them into a laboratory
They can then see a protein that's common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A test substance shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman who has been treated with the vaccine, who learns the immune system to identify predator cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves withdrawing immune cells from a patient, changing them into the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that occurs in many cancers and is called HER2 and then injecting the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results indicate that we have a very promising antibody."
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to remove immune cells from patients and "learn" them how to attack cancer cells has worked to strike a type of leukemia.
Kanye West began with a pro-Trump joke after his performance on SNL, while he wore a MAGA- hat.
It didn't work out.
Kanye West was staged during a Saturday Night Live at the workshop after an extraordinary event in which he believed the US President Donald Trump and said he would make him eligible in 2020.
After he sang his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town and during which he wore a Make America Great-pet, he went out against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"I talk so often to a white man and theirs, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved long ago from America," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's judicial committee on charges of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it is not sown, the imagery of West’s shell was loaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to mock the West by placing it.
West also complained to the audience that it was difficult for him after the promotion of what he wore on his head.
"They tipped me behind the hill.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat.'
They kissed me!
And then they say I'm in a low place," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
The West said, "Do you want to see the low spot?" And he said that he would wear his "superman" because it means that you can't tell me what to do.
"Try love."
His comment attracted at least twice the audience and seemed embarrassed to members of the SNL roll division, Variety reported, with one person there who said to the publication, "The whole studio has become silent."
West was introduced as a late replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the drummer Mac Miller died a few days earlier.
West was very surprised by the performance of the song I Love it, attracted like a Perrier bottle.
West is supported by the Chief of Conservation Group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who protested: "To one of the bravest spirits: thank you for standing up against the crowd."
But Klettsppprogramgasfare Karen Hunter protested that the West was just "who he is and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or by supporting his "art") that I believed to accept an ideology and preach that endangers my society.
He's free.
We too," she added.
Before the show, the rhymestler announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he is now "the beings known before Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Mede-rymkletser, Snoop Dogg, had the name Snoop Lion and, of course, fairy-tale Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who had previously been known as Prince.

Game or Thrones star Kit Harington criticises toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-to - sword role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero and said that such roles on the screen meant that young boys often feel compelled to be respected.
Kit talked to The Sunday Times Culture and said he probably 'something went wrong' and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculineity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his master from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he 'reasonably strong' felt about working on this issue.
'I personally feel quite strong about it at the moment--where did we go wrong with manhood?' he said.
'What did our men learn as they grew up with regard to the problem we now see?'
Kit believes that television is very likely to be responsible for the growth in toxic masculinity because of its extremely masculinity.
He continued: "What is born, and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that make young boys feel that they should have this particular aspect of being a man?
I think it really is one of the big questions in our time - how do we change it?
Because something apparently went wrong with our young men.'
in the interview he also admitted that he would not participate in any of the Game of Thrones' persecutions--and persecutions when the series next summer comes to an end, for he says he is 'ready with battles and horses'.
From November on, Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thought that the best thing that came from Game or Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
'I met my wife on this program, so it gave me my future family, and my life from here,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the loving interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in Emmy's crowned fantasy series.
In June 2018, the couple married Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, its health officials.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, which represents a change of the past.
Traditionally, HIV is rapidly spreading through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have done HIV this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province said.
Year after year, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS increased by 100,000.
MIV transmission through sex is a critical issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimated that 70 - 90% of men who had sex with men would eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to work on the matter.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member of the GOP senators has leaked data, condemns 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
The U.S. Republican Maxine Waters issued on Saturday against allegations that a member of her staff had placed the personal information of three U.S. republican senators on the legislation's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the charges are driven by "ultra-rights" experts and websites.
"False, lie, and yet repugnant lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The selected information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers for US Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday online, placed by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during the Senate Panel's hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against the appointed High Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative Web sites such as Gateway Puntit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the sites related to Waters' office and published the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.
"This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and an absolute lie," the Waters went on.
"The member of my staff -- whose identity, personal information and security were put at risk as a result of this fraudulent and false claim -- was at all not responsible for the outcome of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Water's statement quickly triggered online criticism, including former White House press representative Ari Fleischer.
"This denial testifies to anger," wrote Fleischer.
"It indicates that she does not have the temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He should not be challenging.
He should not question the accused’s motives.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently compared Water’s reaction to the Democrat’s criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of apparently being too angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate trying to highlight Waters in the inter-election from the coasts, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Large if it's true," he shouted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office "announced the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent allegations.
"We will make sure that the pastors are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for everything they do that is destructive and dangerous to every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Review - Blur Rowan Atkinson spying
It is now traditional to search for Brexit meaning in any new movie with a British entry and it seems to apply to this revival of the Johnny English action comedy spotteryfrenchise - which started in 2003 with Johnny English and in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn further difficulties.
Will tongue-in-the-choice self-satisfying about the subject of how obvious power we are is the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the unhelpful Johnny English with his eyelids and rubber face had his license renewing everything for the second time--and his name was a clearer indication than anything else that he was a great comical creation for non-English speaking film audiences.
He is, of course, the suspicious secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretension to sophisticated elegance, had a bit of Clouseau, a bit of Mr. Bean and a good shot from that old one who contributed a single note to the Chariots or Fire-Temalide at the openness of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
He was also originally based on the traveler and international man of mystery, who left chaos behind him, who played Atkinson once in the now forgotten Barclaycard ads.
There are one or two beautiful moments in this latest version of YOU.
I liked Johnny English who came to a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval bakery area and the screwdrivers cut short against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is shown but the humor feels fairly fluttering and peculiarly exaggerated, especially when the "serious" movie trademarks such as 007 and Mission Africa itself now use comedy with confidence as a component.
The sense of humor is more appealing to children than to adults, and for me, Johnny English’s adversity is not as original and focused as Atkinson’s silence groups in the person of Bean.
The permanent thematic assumption is now that Britain is in serious difficulty.
A cube cracker infiltrated Britain's super-secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all Britain's agents in the field, until the agent's disruption to service -- a pitiful little roll for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last broadcast for a prime minister who is a spirited and learned character, who already has a complete breakdown of political dislike: Emma Thompson is doing her utmost with this cassia-Teresa May character, but there's only little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy is in danger, she should summon someone from her retirement.
And that means the shaky Johnny English himself, now serving as a teacher at some noble institution, but what gives lessons from the record about how to be a secret agent, there are some nice jokes here when English offers a school or rock-type spy school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency order and is reunited with his former long-term companion Bough, again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, an all-mapstick role in which Vicki Pepperdine is expected too little.
In this way, the Batman and Robin are fully reasserting everything in Her Majesty’s secret service and coming down to Olga Kurylenko’s beautiful wife fatal Ophelia Bulletin.
Meanwhile, the prime minister comes under the dangerous influence of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the mysterious Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey from ridiculous swordsmanships: mute as waiters they set a French restaurant on fire, causing them chaos when they smuggle themselves on board Volta's luxury sailboat; and English lets pure anarchy break when he tries to use a chapter for virtual reality to become familiar with the inside of Volta's house.
For that last scene nothing is spared, but as fun and outspoken as it may be, the whole affair is quite like child TV.
Reasonably moderate.
And like the other Johnny English scrolls, I couldn't stop thinking: can the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes his talent come to his senses?
Work denies that it thinks a plan for Britte to work a four-day week but is paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Workers' Party needs to consider a drastic plan that will cause Britta to work a four-day week -- but for five days.
The party claims that company-based savings caused by the artificial intelligence (KI) revolution should be transferred to workers by giving up their extra day.
It will allow workers to enjoy a three-day week -- but they will still receive the same payment home.
Sources say that at some’s economic agenda and plans to put the country in favor of the workers, it will ‘appropriate’.
To change after a four-day week, the Trades Union Congress signed as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party member told The Sunday Times: 'A policy review is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
'It won't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an ambition that suits the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Workers' Party will not be the first to subscribe to such an idea, with the Green Party that promised a four-day work week in 2017 during its campaign for the general election.
However, the ambition is not currently being signed by the entire Workers ’ Party.
A spokesman for the Workers' Party said: 'A Thursday work week is not some policy and is not considered by the party.'
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to explore his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from 'unsighted directors' and 'winners' from service companies.
The Minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not recover their entire investment, since a Labour Government can make 'reductions' on the basis of alleged infringement.
He also confirmed plans to place workers in company direction and create inclusive ownership funds to give 10 percent of equity to private sector enterprises, which can receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" or the FBI's study of Kavanaugh can change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court with at least one week and raised the question whether the Bureau's findings could convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked for Republican meanings. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could raise anything that could change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said at the beginning of the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, and that charge came out, and said, 'Did you do it?
He was determined, surely, undiminished."
Graham’s voice, however, seems unchangeable.
"I have formed my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and it will require an accusation of dynamism," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett strongly denied it," continued Graham, referring to Christine Blazey Ford.
"And all those who called her could not confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new."
What is the World Civil War, and did it do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will be the host of the World Burger Festival, an annual music event that has a particularly impressive group of stars that acts and has an equally impressive purpose; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Burger Festival is now in its seventh year and during the festival tens of thousands of people will stream to Central Park’s Great Lawn not only to enjoy action by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes but also to raise awareness of the real purpose of the occasion to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Burger Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World War II project, an international referendum group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free card after the occasion (unless you are willing to pay for a BBP card), concerters had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other significant way to raise awareness of their goal to end poverty.
But just how successful was a 12 - year - old Worldburger who remains in pursuit of his goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert, a good way to convince people to demand a call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clickivism" people who feel they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Worldburger has said that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters, which support a multitude of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion that will potentially affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements that resulted from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or collected.
The group estimates that the confirmed money has so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a US-based company of investors and implementers who are committed to "helping children reach their full potential", and promise to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from World Citizens.
"With the support of the U.S. government, donors, national governments and world citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," Power or Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, after more than 5,000 actions have been taken to bring the UK closer to improving nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced funding for a project, the Power or Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with malnutrition.
In response to one of the general questions on his website that asks, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
"It will be a long and hard path--sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartment movements before us, we will be successful, because we have more strength together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the artists who perform at this year’s New York event, which will be offered by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. may use fleet for "blocks" to prevent exports of Russian energy - Minister of Interior
"If necessary," Washington could leave him on his fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, revealed by the US Minister of Home Affairs Ryan Zinke, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed Russia's involvement in Syria -- in particular where it works at the invitation of the legal government -- is an excuse to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as brokers for energy just as in Eastern Europe, the south of Europe," he said, allegedly.
According to the official, there are ways and means of handling them.
"The United States has the ability, with our Fleet, to ensure that the seas are open, and, if necessary, to block, to make sure their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zincke spoke to the residents of an opportunity offered by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without any profit that they considered to be the "voice of the energy user" in the US.
He went on to compare Washington’s approaches to handling Russia and Iran and noted that it is practically the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, a little or more, to finance and replace fuel," he said, referring to Russia as a "single talent" with an economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The conclusions come as Trump administration was on a mission to give the export of their liquid natural gas to Europe a boost to replace Russia, far from the cheapest option for European consumers.
For that reason, the Trump administration officials, including American President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unappropriate" Nord Stream 2-pipely project, which according to Trump Berlin Moscow makes "prisoners".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fiery opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Minister of Energy, Aleksandr Novak, at a meeting with the American Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. view sparked opposition from Germany, which reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading organization for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI) called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider it seriously" to be president in 2020, Senator of Massachusetts said
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would "consider it seriously" to stand as president after the midterm elections.
At a village meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts confirmed Warren that she would consider standing.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and set our fragmented government straight and it includes a woman in the highest sport," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider standing for the president."
Warren's opinion about President Donald Trump aired during the village meeting and he said "takes the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm so worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very prominent in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
On Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
A recording released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own electors do not think it should stand in 2020.
Eight-and-fifty percent of "probably" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Centre/Boston Globe survey.
Two-and-thirty percent supported the idea that she should stand.
The survey showed more support for the idea that former Governor Defal Patrick should stand, with 38 percent supporting the idea that he should stand up for potential and against it 48.
Other high profile democratic names discussed to be possible in 2020 include former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont's Senator Bernie Sanders.
Prayer said he would officially decide in January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin called Track Palin's PTSV by Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September
He was arrested Monday night and charged with an accident of domestic violence
"What my own son has been going through, what he has been going through since he came back, I have sympathy with other families that feel the consequences of PTSV and the injury our soldiers are returning with," she told a audience at a convention for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they come back a little differently, they come back hard, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and air force and every other member of the army have given to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, assault of a woman, interference with complaints of domestic violence and possession of a firearm while under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Station.
18 states, D.C. supports the challenge of new asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new US policy that rejects asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district submitted a friend of the court order Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker and challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the claimant in the Grace v. Sessions contest submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy was not disclosed.
She says to her mate "and her violent sons," she mistreats her, but American officials refused her request for asylum on July 20th.
She was kept in Texas.
The state prosecutors who supported Grace, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, described as nations facing deep problems with gangs and domestic violence in the face.
In 2014, the new US asylum policy was reversed by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (Council of Immigrant Appeals) which allowed immigrants without the necessary documents fleeing from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Columbia's Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday in a statement that the new policy "regards the state, federal and international laws."
"Federal laws require that all asylum applications will certainly be on the specific facts and circumstances of the demand, and such a lawyer violates that policy," said the friend-of-the-court court order.
Prosecutors have further argued in the legal order that the policies that deny immigrants access, damage the US economy, and say it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary work."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions commissioned immigration lawyers in June to no longer allow asylum to be granted to victims fleeing for domestic and gang violence.
"Asiel is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership to a specific social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his announcement of the policy on June 11th.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems — even not all the serious problems — that people face every day throughout the world.
Hopeful Rescue Efforts in Palu While Deadly Doubles in Race to Find Survivors
For survivors, the situation is growing narrow.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma while she comforted her curly babysitter at a disincentive in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute brings an ambulance body.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents were seen returning to their ruined homes, searching for drunken possessions, trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 - magnitude earthquake, were overwhelmed.
Of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and shoulder, rest outside Palu’s air - conditioned hospital where patients are treated outside because of constant strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted the violent earthquake that shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was impressed in the wall's ruins, I think," said Harris to Associated Press and added that he and his family were in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but then shut up.
I don’t know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of 'debriefing' with 'propaganda-advertising'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American daily that promotes the mutual benefits of U.S. trade, the U.S. ambassador for China Beijing accused the American press of spreading propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the China Daily's paid insert in the Des Moines Register – the state's newspaper Iowa with most sales – after accusing China of interfering with the U.S. Congress elections of 6 November, a complaint that China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. elections, noted what U.S. officials told Reuters, a new phase in an increasing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a escalating trade war that has led to their becoming tariff rounds on each other's imports.
China’s payroll rates early in the trade war were aimed at beating performers in states like Iowa who supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa for a long time, a great farmer of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "enhancing debriefing now by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government seizes America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, one will find very limited divergent voices at the newspaper kitchen in the street here in Beijing and not see any real reflection of the diverse opinions that the Chinese people have about China's disturbing economic track, giving that the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers was afraid of the offer to publish his article", although he did not say what newspaper.
Republican foreign women's electors for inter-election with Kavanaugh debacle, warning analysts
While many top Republicans at the High Court-recognised Brett Kavanaugh stand and defend him in the face of various allegations of sexual assault, analysts warned that during the upcoming inter-elections they would see a counter-reaction, especially of women.
The emotions over this are great, and most Republicans remember that they already indicate that they want to continue with the vote.
Those things can't be reversed," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School for The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted if Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s incentive for an FBI investigation into the nipper would be enough to appease angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday--they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, "November is on its way!" protestors bled in the entrance gate of the Senate while the Republicans who had chosen the Judicial Committee to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blazey Ford reported to Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the press.
"People say it was already high; that's true.
But it can be higher, especially among the swathed female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who often don't vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public testimony that sets out the details of her charge of sexual assault against the Supreme Court-genomimated, analysts said a counter-reaction could follow if Republicans continued to confirm.
"It became a mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee's vote or the final vote or the Kavanaugh being put on the stand, it's also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, pointed out to the news channel a group that helped choose Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided about who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimonies, with a little more to choose from than the latter.
A new survey of YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe in either ford’s testimony, while 35 say they believe in Kavanaugh either.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely joking during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake’s urging, the FBI is currently investigating the charges made by Ford, as well as at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford vowed last week before the Senate Judicial Committee that Kavanaugh had assaulted her at the age of 17 while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the High Court-recognised her sexual relations while attending a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global web is planning to start a new web site to tell Google and Facebook about the fight
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, leads a start business that tries to work with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inruptt, is a company that built on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what people are allowed to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee ridiculed the idea of "world domination" with Inrupt.
"We must do it now," he said of the project.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It may include contact lists, mailing lists, calendars, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at the same time and on one browser.
What is unique about the personal online data storage is that it depends entirely on who can access that type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorization by data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company’s HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers on the staff hired to work on the project and a community of volunteer encoders.
From this week on, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about announcing a total change anyway, where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We do not ask their permission."
In a placement on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee redesigned the Internet when he established the World Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even as he leads Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this next era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Water: WW1 Victoriakruis-spiritual celebration
The only minister of the Church of England who won the Victory Cross as a fighter during World War I was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt.kol Honorary Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later he was killed by a sniper and never knew that he had earned the highest British military honor.
A monument was discovered on Saturday by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "bright symbolic" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s crowned achievement.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, he won his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through very dense mist and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns."
He later hurried to the line of fire and with the "greatest stamina" led the line forward before he only stormed a field gun and blew out three of the department.
Lt.kol Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's act is "something I know I can never stand, but something that is humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a crown on the parades, led by the Brentwood Imperial Jugorkes.
Michael Vann said he "felt compelled to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support given by a bunch of people."
MMA supporters stay awake all night to watch Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Picture yourself, you stay awake all night to watch the packed Bellator 206, just so that you cannot watch the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 combats, including six on the main program that would be broadcast directly by night in the United States on Channel 5.
At about 6 p.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to tell each other about the fight, viewers were shocked in the United States when the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after staying awake especially for the fight until early hours.
On Twitter, one supporter described the switch to the children's picture as "some sick joke."
"It is a government rule that the content was not suitable at 6 nm and therefore they had to switch to child programmes," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communication, when he was asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the girl," yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they would work on their scheduling to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think of the broadcast, I think we can probably work something out," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when it changed, there were many text messages that were sent over and over again, and it wasn't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that this will not happen the next time.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six — as we normally do — and we have tried to offer more to our adherents and just go over our time.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'minor' about sexuality
Olympic divers Tom Daley says he grew up with a feeling of inferiority about his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't go to high school until he realized that "not everyone like me is."
When he spoke on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs offered by Lauren Laverne, he said he was complaining about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also said that to become a parent, he was less concerned about winning the Olympic Games.
The regular provider of the year-long program, Kirsty Young, took a few months off because of illness.
When he appeared as a rejection on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else when he grew up, because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, those feelings are less than, and otherwise, the real things that have given me the power and energy to achieve success."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medal winner became a high profile LGBT fighter and used his appearance at this year's national games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He says that he has given up his feelings because he is so happy to live openly without consequences and wants to give others “hope. ”
The three-time world champion said that to fall in love with a man – U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – "has caught up with him."
Daley was married last year to the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he is, but says the age difference was never a question yet.
"When you spend so much on such a young age," he went to his first Olympic Games at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and low points.
In June, the couple became parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says she "full perspective" changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything went about 'I must win a gold medal'," he said.
"But you know, there are more things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father Robert who died at the age of 40 in 2011 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked for or they already had cards for London 2012 – because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him 'you're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally recognized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of my life for a long time--to dive before my homecoming at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first selection of songs — Proud by Heather Small — who also reasoned with him in the construction of the Olympic Games and still gives him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson does not drive and withdraws from Saturday’s Riderbecker
American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday when he plays his 47th Rider-Beaver game, but he will have to get his form to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for a record- 12th time in the two-year event, was withdrawn from the game by Captain Jim Fury for Saturday's four-ball games and four-digits.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time Major-winner will divide his day between being a racist leader and working on the practice at his game in the hope of setting up what should be.
Even at the top of his career he was never the most upright driver, and therefore the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National-train where the long roughness always penalizes the rolling heaps.
And as if the track on its own wasn't challenging enough, Mitchellson came Sunday in his ninth match against the accurate British Ope Champion Francesco Molinari, who was working together with new Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind, start the 12 single - game games well, Mickelson’s fight can be absolutely necessary.
Furik expressed his confidence in his husband, not that he could say much differently.
"He fully understood his role he had today, gave me a blow on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be right tomorrow," said Fury.
"He has great confidence in himself.
He is in the Heldesaal and has contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t think he would play two games.
I put more into perspective, but this is how things worked out and what we thought we should do.
He wants to be on the job, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will surpass Sunday’s Nick Faldo’s record for the player who played most of the rider’s race.
This can mark the end of a rider’s career that has never really matched the peaks of his individual performances.
Mickelson had 18 blanches, 20 downs, and seven and a half, although Furik said that his presence had contributed to the team’s hideous aspects.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's caught, he likes to cut the crap, and he's a wonderful old man to have in the spa room," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed to laugh with him, which was fun to watch.
He offers so much more than just playing."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows great progress can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advance before the last day's single game in the Driver's Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Dan made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where the team led by Seven Ballesteros, had a five-point lead, but only scored with 141⁄2-131.2.
"People continue to remind themselves that we had a great advantage at Valderrama; we had a great advantage at Brooklyn, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won our nail-screw," said Bjorn, on the photo, after he looked at how the 2018 Class gained Friday 5-3 and yesterday was 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So, history will show me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
You're going full speed tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It is not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and it's to try to win the trophy, and that's where the focus remains.
I always say, I focus on the 12 players that are in our team, but we are also well aware of who is on the other side – the best players in the world."
Enjoying how his players went on the hard golf course, Bjorn adds, "I will never get ahead with this.
Tomorrow's a different color horse.
Tomorrow it's the individual participation that comes in turn, and it's a horse of another color.
It's wonderful to be out there with a friend when things go well, but when you're there individually, you're tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message that you should deliver to players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now leave your mate behind, and he must also find the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his equator Jim Furik would want his players to travel better individually than they did as gamers, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points from four.
Furik himself had already been on both sides of that great last day, where he was part of the wish team at Brooklyn before he ended as a loser when Europe had achieved the "miracle of Medina."
"I remember every covert word of it," he said in reply when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999 spoke boldly to his players on the way to that last day.
"We had 12 important fights tomorrow, but one would like to start well, as was seen at Brooklyn, as was seen at Medina.
When that moment begins in one direction, it puts great strain on that middle race.
We set up our team then and divided the men that we felt, you know, will bring something magic to us tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the attack and facing Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, who are the other Europeans in the upper half of the division.
"I have chosen this group in the spring in this order, for I think it covers it to the end," said Bjorn about his single-game choices.
Germany’s New Warship Retired
The German army's latest frgate would have been in service in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War era, but it won't be there until at least next year, due to faulty systems and growing costs, reports local media.
The use of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Zeit newspaper quoted by a military spokesman.
This vessel had to join the Fleet in 2014, but the troubled post-supply issues plagued this ambitious project's fate.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels ordered by the Fleet in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, a battled air defence and anti-shipping missiles, as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods — it should be possible to develop the latest frescoes for up to two years away from tihasa.
However, continuous delays mean that the advanced warships — apparently enabling Germany to design force overseas — will already be obsolete by the time they enter into service, called The Time.
Last year, the F125-fregate crashed when the German fleet officially refused to put the vessel into service and sent it back to Blohm & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Fleet has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media noted that a number of essential "software and hardware defects" would render the ship useless if it was deployed in a fight.
Software defects are particularly important since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the manpower on older Bremen class frigates.
It also showed that the ship was dramatically overweight, reducing the performance of the work and reducing the fleet’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tons of "Rheinland-Pfalz" is probably twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the label for the entire project – including the training of the crew – also became a question.
It obviously reached an incredible €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the original €2.2 billion.
Problems that have plagued the new frigates are especially important in the light of recent warnings that the power of Germany’s fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the Fleet's "ships that can be deployed are in progress."
The officer said that the matter had worsened over time, for old ships had been put out of service, but no replacement vessels had been provided.
He complained that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg's classes could join the Fleet.
National Trust listens to bats ’ secret lives
New research is being carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help to conduct future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual and soprano vertebrate mouse as well as the brown long - distance and Daubenton vertebrate mice at Inverewe Gardens in West Ross.
Special recorders will be placed on the property at important locations to trace bat activities throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also make mobile recordings using hand indicators.
Expert audio channels of all recordings will check the frequency of the mouse calls and determine what species to do.
A map and a report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal what habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management such as farming and how to manage forest lands best for bats and other associated species.
In Scotland and throughout the United States, bat populations have declined significantly during the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affects sleep and habitat losses.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as can fly paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by house cats.
Multiple mice are not really blind.
But because of their nightly activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo orientation technique to show goggles and obstacles on their flight speed.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres [760,000 ha] of land, is very serious about bats.
This has been done by ten trained experts who regularly do recording and sleeping inspections and sometimes perform rescues.
The organization even set up Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve at Thrave land goods in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Land manager David Thompson says the land is the ideal place for them.
"Here at Thrave we have a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many old trees and all the good habitat.
But there are so much about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us to better understand what they need to flourish."
He stresses the need to search for bats before conservation in property is done because it is possible that unaware destruction of a single scratch can mean the death of 400 females and young children and can wipe out a whole local population.
Multiple mice are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb, or prevent or destroy their sleeping spots.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to step in to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations go."
Ronaldo finished raping allegations while prosecutors were preparing for the German journal
Cristiano Ronaldo filed rape allegations against him as "false news" and said that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His prosecutors are ready to report to German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
The Portuguese and Juventus predictor was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to remain silent about the incident, reported Der Spiegel Friday.
In an Instagram Live video in which he spoke to his 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were published, Ronaldo, 33, finished the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but it's part of the whole thing.
I am a happy man and everything is right," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo's prosecutor is preparing to march Der Spiegel on the claim, which they, according to Reuters, called "an unacceptable reporting of suspicion in the field of privacy".
Prosecutor Christian Schertz said the player would claim compensation for "moral damages for any amount consistent with the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her, according to documents submitted at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo had fallen to his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "99 percent" a "good old" left in the way by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and had taken photos of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to a trial outside the court because she was "feared for revenge" and worried about being "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she wants to reverse the fit now because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Manchester United at Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack and moved this summer, in a €100 million agreement to the Italian giant, Juve.
Brexit: UK will 'repent forever' if their car manufacturers lose it
The U.S. 'will repent forever' if they lose their status as world leader in car manufacturing to Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it is "beautiful" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it will have to stop production temporarily at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the case of a non-agreement Brexit, posts could be eaten.
The Burnaston plant – produced by Toyota's Auris and Avensis – last year produced nearly 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see how production is stopped in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK engine manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, were afraid to leave the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade would work.
BMW, for example, said they'd shut down their mini-installation in Oxford for a month to Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers say are feed chain risks in the case of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line runs on a "only-time" basis, with components that arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be a disturbance on the border which the company may say will lead to delays and cuts in parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to maintain more than a day's stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid those controls at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that, as I say, will allow us not only to enjoy the present success, but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The indications of not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, are that we absolutely need to proceed with what a very successful set of feed chains were."
Toyota could not say how long production would be discontinued, but warned that added costs in the long term could reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually cost postage.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the UN's co-rapporteur on the plant, says his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when this post disappears, it never comes back.
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, Whitehouse says
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein can be "exposed for another week" while the fighting over nominated for High Court Brett Kavanaugh continued, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special legal adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian election intervention, links between Trump helpers and Russia and possible cross-breeding of the law by the president.
Whether Trump is going to resign or not, and thereby threatens Mueller's independence, Washington's scanner stories have been on fire for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of bringing up a recorder to open talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he was on his way to thank.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose not to say thank you" to Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a confrontation with the Senate tribunal's trial in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump postponed a one-week FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh and the full Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "A date for it has not yet been determined; it may be this week, I can see that it is postponed by another week with all the other things that proceed with the High Court.
But we will see and I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists will differ with that statement: Sanders haven't held a White House press session since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of information sessions is not due to a bias for TV journalists who are "effect-hunting", although she said, "I will not fight the fact that they are effect-hunting."
She admitted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more V&A sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without quoting evidence: "We looked at the numbers."
Information sessions will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask directly to the President of the United States questions, then it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do a lot, and you've seen a lot of it over the past few weeks, and it's going to take the place of a percentage session when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump answers questions regularly when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press statements with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press statements are scarce.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unbounded and time-consuming appearance in front of journalists gathered there.
Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to show the country’s gratitude and express the hope that they will stay with Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months before the US withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering costs of completed status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer negotiations between the US and the EU continued on withdrawal, on the way to expected decisions this autumn.
But the US government has also stepped up their preparations for a possible non-agreement scenario.
I know it's a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I want to repeat how much I value each employee’s contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service’s work, and in which the patients and communities we serve benefit.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we want you to stay here.
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after major injury
Tennessee State Tigers' liner Christian Abercrombie had an emergency operation after he suffered a major injury on Saturday 31-27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Tennessee's Mike Organ.
Tennessee State’s chief executive, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury had occurred shortly before rest.
"He came to the edge and sort of just fell in there," said Reed.
Teachers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen along the edge before being placed on a portable and then taken back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was from the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details about the type/size of the injury" and Tennessee still tried to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an academic second year, was in his first season at Tennessee State after he moved from Illinois.
He died on Saturday five times before leaving the game, bringing his total season to 18 deaths.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the United States
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp tax when they buy property in the US and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans
This move will neutralize Corby's attempt to move young voters
The stamp tax will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to collect up to £120 million a year — to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp tax when they buy a property in the United States – with the extra cash that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters with promises to provide more cost-effective housing and target high earners.
The seal tax increase will be lifted on individuals and firms not paying U.S. taxes, with the extra money that the government’s plans will help to counter the lack of port.
The by - tax — which is outside the current seal tax, including the higher levels set up two years ago on second houses and houses purchased for rent — may be as much as three percent.
The Treasurer expects this movement to bring up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built London properties are purchased by non-US citizens who push the prices up and make it harder for first buyers to get a foot in the housing door.
Many well-being areas of the country — especially in the capital — have become "spook villages" as a result of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in seal tax to help more young people to own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by grabbing land, but not using it, and encouraged Mrs. May to distance herself from affordable homes to restore Britain’s “dwelling disaster. ”
Mr Corbyn announced a striking series of proposed housing improvements, including rental management and an end to "no-error-exposures".
He also wants to give advice greater power to build new homes.
Ms. May said: "Last year I said I will devote my prime minister to restoring the British dream – that life must be better for every new generation.
And it means restoring our fragmented home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work, and build a life.
But it cannot rightly be as easy for individuals who do not live in the United States, as can foreign - based companies, to buy homes as well as hard - working British citizens.
For too many people the dream of homelessness has become a dream for a long time, and the humiliation of vanity is too great a reality."
Jack Ross: 'My greatest ambition is to run Scotland'
Sunderland Chief Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become the driver of Scotland at one stage.
The Scottish, 42, enjoys the challenge of blowing up new life in the North East Span, currently in third place in Liga One, three points below the top.
He moved this summer to the Light Stadium after returning to the Scottish Premiery last season.
"I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I got the second team, but it was already," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But as a child I have often seen with my father for Scotland at Hampden and this is something that pulls me back.
However, the opportunity can only come if I'm successful with club management."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland Manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he was not afraid to follow such established names at such a large club, after he had previously shown Barnsley and Ipswich Town offers out of hand.
"At the moment will success be measured for me by ''Can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it certainly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably just consider myself successful if I can get the club back there."
Ross' career in the management is only three years, after a period as assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month period on Hearts' retirement staff.
He then helped Alloa return from religion to the third league, and St. Mirren converted from religion to champions of the championship title in the following season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever felt during his plays at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real crossroad," he said as he thought back on how he had taken over Alloa's skirts.
"I really believed the management was the right place for me, even more than to play.
It sounds bizarre, because I've done well enough, made a reasonable existence out of it, and experienced reasonable highlights.
But the game can be difficult.
There are many things you have to come through on a weekly basis.
I still go through it with regard to the stress and pressure of the work, but driving just feels right.
I always wanted to drive and now I do it, it feels the easiest I've been in my entire adult life."

The perfect time for a paint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, found recording
The summer heat wave improved Britain’s suffocating croissants’ income, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinks and group sales in July saw an increase of 2.7% – but receipts in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent, showed figures.
Peter Martin, of CGA's business consulting company, who compiled the figures, says: "Pre-supposed sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that Julie followed a pattern similar to the previous month, June, when drinks were up by 2.8 percent, except that restaurants were even more heavy.
The fall of 1.8 percent in restaurant trade in June only worsened in July.
Drinky-led drinking places and croissants did far better and increased more than restaurants went down.
Food-borne drinking places also suffered in the sun, but not as bad as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Over driven cows and drinking places, sales increased by 6.6 per cent for the month, with food being reduced by three per cent."
Paul Newman, of the leisure and hospitality analyst RSM, said: "These results continue the trend that we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sports events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-the-home market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to have difficulty, although a decrease in sales of 4.8 per cent per year will be particularly difficult at the top and in addition to constant cost pressure.
The long warm summer could not have come at a worse time for food-led operators and would only show time if the more moderate temperatures we have experienced since August would bring the necessary relief."
Total growth in sales across drinking places and restaurants, including new places that opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in trademarks.

One of five children has secret social media accounts that they hide for their parents
One of five children – some as young as 11 – has secret social media accounts that they hide for their parents and teachers reveal a record
Recording of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "false Insta pages"
The news raised fear of sexual content being placed
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main account" to show parents
One of five children — some as young as 11 — creates social media accounts that keep them secret to adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in "false Insta accounts" – a reference to the Instagram photo industry.
The news increased the fear that sexual content would be placed.
Twenty percent of students said they have a clean "main account" to show parents, but also have private accounts.
One mother who came down on her 13-year-old daughter's secret shop found a teenager who encouraged others to "rape her".
The research, by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11-to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them admitting that they have private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Second Doyle will be "vote for athletes" on Scottish Sports Council
Elidh Doyle was elected to the council of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the governing body's general annual meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated job and field analyst and President Ian Beattie has described the step as a wonderful opportunity for those who are leading the sport to benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilīd has great respect for the Scottish, UK and world athletic community and we are certainly athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from what she brings to the council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I am eager to act as a voice for athletes I hope I can really contribute and help to lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who has the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games under his four gold Olympic medals, is now a regular BBC expert, could not run after having had a short-term ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a stroke.
I could not walk.
Doctors said that only time would be learned whether I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but it was fully restored, learning again how to walk and do funeral exercises today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Brush-spare version comparing mothers to cows sharing opinions online
A boar pump company distributed opinions online with an ad comparing breast feeding mothers to milked cows.
Celebrating the lead of what is called the "world's first still portable breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released a tongue-in-the-choice music video inspired ad to show the freedom that the pump gives to milking mothers.
Four right moms dance in a bowl of straw and cows on the measure of a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a star" and "If you haven't seen it, it's not smells, it's my breasts."
The part reads, "Throw it out, pump it out, I run the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
But the advertisement published on the company’s Facebook page caused online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of observations, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many who say that it undermines the "grills" of the dairy industry.
"Many poor decisions to use cows to advertise this product.
If we have to become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days of giving birth," wrote one.

Another observed: "Incredible traumas to mother and baby.
But yes, why not use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "The ad is so emotional."
Others defended the ad, with one woman who admitted that the song was "screaming" for her.
"I think it's a great idea.
I would have had one if I were still breast - feeding.
To milk made me feel just like a cow.
The ad is a little bit, but I accepted it for what it is.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another observed: "It's a nice ad directed at mothers who are milking (usually in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cows".
This is not an ad that praises or condemns the cookie industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discreet pump in their arms.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many milking women say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump is still dead, however, has no wire or pipe and is only discreet in a feeding bridge that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they milk.
Ana Balarin, friend and UKD at Mother noted: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a great and exciting announcement.
By drawing a parallel between milking women and dairy cows, we wanted to put the milking process and all its challenges into the collage, while we were in a fun way that people can join in demonstrating the wonderful sense of freedom that will bring the new pump.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump got the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the run for designer Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children still move to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply although monthly border organism has remained relatively unchanged, partly because of rhetorical errors and policies established by the Trump administration, which make it more difficult to place children at home.
Traditionally, most citizens were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country would be compromised by moving forward to raise a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential citizens and other adult members of their households should pass their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs officer at Congress, testified that the agency arrested thousands of people who applied to provide unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
"Almost 80 percent of the individuals who are either citizens or family members of citizens are illegal here in the country and a large number of them are criminal foreigners.
That's why we're going to continue to persecute those individuals," Mr. Albence said.
In an effort to speed up the handling of the children, officials set up new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month after detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear through videoconferencing, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status with an immigration judge.
Those considered unfit for relief will be quickly deported.
The longer the children stay in custody, the more likely it is that they will become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent eruptions or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged in recent months from the system.
Advocates say those concerns are raised at a greater facility such as Tornillo, where signs that a child's difficulty is more easily overlooked because of the size.
They added that moving the children to the tent village without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally to say good - bye to friends can exacerbate the trauma that is already very difficult.
Syria tells the U.S., French and Turkish 'occupational forces' to withdraw immediately
When he spoke to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign powers are illegal on Syrian soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism and will be "denominated".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said to the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, with millions more who have been displaced, was "almost over".
He said that Damascus would continue "to wage this holy war until we cleansed all Syrian territories" of both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, who mostly train and advise Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war - torn country.
On the issue of refugees Moualem said that the conditions were good for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational fears that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're policing something that just has to be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major Idlib rebellion, created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement rejected a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear scurries" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including Al-Qaeda-connected Nusra Front warriors who would be "outlawed".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to establish a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Moualem prescribed conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee and said the panel's work should be limited to the "following the articles of the current Constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the re-election in 2020, unless, like many liberal hopes, a state of charge and scandals ends his presidency early.
In what no doubt "the most dramatic finals of a presidency will ever be!"
Until now, there are no signs of visual fatigue.
Since 2014, peak rates have been more than double to 1.05 million at CCN and almost triple to 1.6 million at MSNCBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million peak viewers, of 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is top of cable watching figures with as many as 3.5 million viewers on big news.
"It's a fire to which people have been attracted, because it's not something we understand," says Neal Baer, programme director of the ABC drama "Designated Survival" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Trusts About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he lets me laugh,' said Scovell to me.
There is value for entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the history lines from Washington can determine the future of Red V. Wade, or immigrant families can reunite and the health of the world economy.
To turn off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being just an informed citizen when you are in the sixth hour to watch a panel of experts debate about Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" from his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 volstroistre-airflight bay ("a piece of clothing thick from the hubris," The Washington Post said) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario again in the same way.
"Part of what he does makes it feel like a reality program is that he brings you something every night," says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pown Stars," about the Trump program's changing role-sharing and daily kicks in the plot (as if to seek a fight with N.F.L., Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode, otherwise you stay behind.
When I arrived this week for Mr. Fleiss, it was 80 degrees outside his house on the northern coast of Kaui, but he was inside looking at MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He could not cut himself off, was not with Brett Kavanaugh on the way to appear before the Senate’s Court and the future of the High Court hanging in the balance.
"I remember when we did all that bad programs and people said, 'It's the beginning of the end of Western civilization,' said Mr. Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it seems now they were right."

Out-of-charge stream to most exciting mid-term selection competitions at home
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th century saw an influx of money, thanks to the displacement of congressional districts that two officials have now been in a race for the same seat.
The recently changed suburban Pittsburg district allows Democratic Rep. Connor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring – to measure forces.
Lamb is against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which is heavily overwhelmed with the new 17th.
The maps were withdrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January determined that the old districts were unconstitutional in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th ended with a campaign financing competition between the major parties' financial legs, the Democratic Field Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Field Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well - known name in Pennsylvania after a nailed win in a widely viewed special election in March for Pennsylvania’s 18th Congression.
The seat was kept by a republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a small benefit.
U.S. considered punishing El Salvador, rather than supporting China, but then deviated
Diplomat noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until friends expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials of the state department decided to call back the US heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the "recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, earlier this month in a statement.
But fines were only considered against El Salvador that received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug management, development and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, including a reduction in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level convention and focused on security and economic progress to follow up on a similar convention last year that was seen as a step forward in an effort to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the Congress to continue to effectively put an end to any consideration of El Salvador's fines.
Deputy President Mike Pence is now destined to address the Congress, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the seriousness of the convention for administration, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new angry messages or sentences from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal debate on the condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst who was close to the administration and also talked about the condition of anonymity.
Study history
The next thing that may happen can be the special discussion of Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible crossbow of the court, of which there is now much significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller's focus is also likely to be his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia worked in the country's attack on our elections.
If the Congress were to pass in other hands, Mr. Trump would have to face responsibility in that body, only when he was prepared to go again before the electors, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peer group.
It's a lot of aces, and I don't want to imply that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable – and not those of his equators in Europe.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, which will affect how much the battle can be calculated.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a state attack on Hitler, when the West only opposed him and supported the Czecho-Slovake at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the ensuing slaughter of the years.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and democracy’s relentless course is being hastened or delayed.
Americans now face several such turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation, says goodbye?
Rosenstein had been in hot water since this newspaper reported that he proposed last year to take up the president secretly and speculate on whether he was qualified for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times report is incorrect.
"How will we react if Brett Kavanaugh's new FBI investigation is not complete or justified – or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court in spite of credible charges of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the inter-election for a congress that will hold Mr. Trump responsible?
If we watch those tests, there's a long winter for democracy.
But I believe that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who lived at a time in my ambassador's house.
She survived, migrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to visit the Sabbath church on that table that the weavers carry.
With this as my origin, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers Graham Dorrans Optimistics for Rapid Vienna Fight
Rangers play hosts Thursday for Rapid Vienna knowing that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive equalisation in Spain against Villareal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europe League.
A knee injury has prevented media player Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season to the 2-2 equal attack against Villareal, but he believes Rangers can use this rash as a starting point for bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villareal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the fight with the conviction that we could get something and walked away with a point.
Maybe we could have won it at the end, but an equalization is probably a fair outcome.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a difficult fight, because they had a good outcome in their last match, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can get through and get a positive outcome.
Last year was certainly difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club, but now there is a sense of well-being in the place.
The group is good, and the men really enjoy it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now get through, last season sit behind us and be successful."
Women Lose Sleep Over This Fear of Despair
Despite the fact that survey participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk about it to their relatives.
About half of the individuals in the Nationalwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10 percent said that they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, the vice president of the National Wide Life Insurance Business.
Here is where to begin.
Speak to your spouse and the children: You cannot prepare your family to provide for yourself if you do not express your wishes long before the time comes.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Enter your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you to come forward with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term insurance funding decisions can include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash-life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance with your own abilities – as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut legal disputes at the suit.
Get a health authority instead so you can assign a trusted individual to supervise your medical care and ensure that experts meet your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Think, too, about your finances.
You should choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your accounts are paid if you are not in a position to do so.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is hospitalized on the way.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Play those details in a written plan so you will be ready.
"It's not only the financial issues that are involved, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What is the medication?
Who will care for the dog?
Make sure that plan is in place."
Several times in Ilfracombe with a windshield
A man was shot several times with a windshield when he walked home after the night.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which took place at about 02:30 BST, as a "like action".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries were not life - threatening, and the police asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu Friday, officials said, and the death count is expected to rise.
With communication out of action, relief officers could not get any information from Dongala's account, an area north of Palu that is close to the center of the 7.5-scale earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were taken to safety after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central-Sulawesi province, located at the point of a small bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck them.
Dongala is a regent that stretches over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The accounting, an administrative area under a province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the pillars of the Central Sulawesi province's economy, especially the coastal area of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is usually concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit several times over the past 100 years by tsunamis, according to the Indonesia Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami caused more than 200 deaths and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami also struck West Donghala in 1996 and caused nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A great earthquake along the western coast of the Indonesian Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December, which led to a tsunami affecting 14 countries, led to 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in March and early in April.
Hundreds died in Nias Island, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6,8-volume hit the south of Java, Indonesia is the most populous island, leading to a tsunami that hit the southern coast and caused nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6-scale earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-scale earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, which led to a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and resulted in about 300 deaths.
2016: A level of shaking hit the Pidie Jaya account in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly shaking and tsunami in 2004.
It didn't lead to a tsunami this time, but more than 100 are dead because of buildings that have collapsed,
2018: Great shocks hit Indonesia's tourist island Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily beached.
Sarah Palin’s oldest son is arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and the vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report issued on Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he took off a woman’s phone when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on a $500 unsecured loan, reports KTUU.
He appeared in the court on Saturday, where he declared “innocent, certainly” when asked what he argued, reported the network.
Palin faces three class A violations in the face, which means he can lock up for up to a year and be fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B offense, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal complaints have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is now before Alaska’s Veteran Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a firearm while he was drunk, in connection with the incident.
His girl claimed that he had boxed her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterinary groups in 2016 after linking her son’s behavior to PTSD as a result of her duty in Iraq.
Indonesia Earthquake tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-scale earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been put out of action with deaths expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside the central Sulawesi, which is northeastern of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media that shows the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu, when the tsunami struck the beach.
Federal Prosecutors Seek Rare Death Penalty for Suspects in NYC Terrorist Attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for the death penalty for Sayfillo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that has resulted in the death of eight people -- a rare punishment that has not yet been committed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a Home Depot rental engine to launch an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side motorway in Laer Manhattan to harvest pedestrians and a bicycle driver who was on his way in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injuries, according to the notice of intention to request the death penalty, submitted in the Southern District of New York.
Both of those accused carry a possible death penalty, according to the court record.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury beat Saipov with 22 charges, which included eight counts of murder for the benefit of extortion, typically used by federal prosecutors in organised crime, and a complaint of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "defense planning and preconceivedness", the prosecutors said and described the way Saipov carried it out as "fearful, cruel and perverse".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," said the intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the South District of New York prosecuted a death sentence.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York, in 1953, was for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed after being sentenced to a conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were hit with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He mentioned to investigators that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He innocently pleaded with the 22 prosecutors.
David Patton, one of the federal pro Deo lawyers representing Saipov, said they were "of course disappointed" with the persecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to desire the death penalty rather than to accept a confession to life imprisonment with no possible release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned." Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked persecutors not to want the death penalty.
Tory LP says that NIGEL FARAGE should be placed in control of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize "the people's military" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians had to "feel hot" from Eurosceptic – as one of Theresa May's own LPs proposed he should be in control of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative back-banker Peter Bone told the March in Birmingham that by the time the UK was "soo" as Mr. Farage Brexit's secretary.
But the challenge that Mrs. May faces to unite her deep-separated officers by invading pro-Roman Tories by joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister struggles to keep her Chequers compromise plan moving in the midst of attacks by Brexitians, Remainers and the EU.
Allied parties insisted that she would press the door in her attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels in spite of the death march – and Eurosceptici and Labour forced her to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone said for the Loop Meaning of the Solihull Loop Assembly that he wanted to throw out the Chequers.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been made a nobleman and given the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he was in control, we would have been out by the time,' he said.
The Wellingborough-LP added, 'I'll stand up for Brexit, but we have to throw out Chequers.'
He outlined his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.'
Mr. Bone pointed out that public opinion has changed since the 2016 polling: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain completely false.’
Tory Brexitier Andrea Jenkins was also at the March and told reporters: ‘ I’m simply saying: First Minister, listen to the people.
‘Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular with some of us and our activists who actually bomb the streets and make sure that we are elected in the first place.
Please let Chequers go and start listening."
In a direct message to Mrs. May, she added: ‘First Ministers must keep their jobs when they keep their promises. ’
Mr. Farge said that convention politicians should feel the "hot" if they were on the threshold to violate the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
'It is now about a matter of trust between us--the people--and our political class,' he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them, 'we won't let you go with it.'
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: ‘I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
“We mobilize the people’s resistance to this country that has won our victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-regulatory, proud United Kingdom. ”
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding an assembly for two hours in the city center.
A few activists called Tories against Brexit banners after the group's announcement this weekend.
Worker Lord Adonis ridiculed the conservatives for the security issues they endured with a party application like the conference opened.
'It's the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus in place, for the uninterrupted border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,' he added.
'It's a total joke.
There's not such a thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to 'hard to watch' to stand for the president
U.S. Sen Elizabeth Warren says she'll "hard to watch for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about her future at a city hall meeting in Western Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, faces a re-election against GOP in November, Rep Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She is already in the midst of speculation that her Trump might be challenging in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents using the city hall format since Trump was in power.
An associate asked her if she was planning to stand for the president.
Warren replied that it was time "for women to go to Washington to correct our broken government, and it locks in a woman quite above."
Arrested in the shooting of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced Saturday that a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayne Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 p.m. ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help in identifying a man who was seen in the image.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near Southern University.
"Wayde Sims had a gunshot wound in his head and was finally killed because of it," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media by 247 sports Saturday.
Wayde came in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene, owned a gun, and admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 young man who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 fronts last season and held an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton hits world title after being ordered by a team to win over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified Saturday before Lewis Hamilton when Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the recessions.
From the pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost won for Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel first entered the wells and left Hamilton behind to enter the bound, something that must have been decisive.
The Mercedes blew a round later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton went forward to wheel-to-wheel action which the Ferrari driver objected to risk-free the inner vision had left at risk of stamina to a double-movement to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen began from the rear row of the road course and was seventh by the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the rations as he held on to his bands to quickly prepare and hide Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He may have entered the wells on the 44th rounds, but could not speed up his pace in the remaining eight rounds, since Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said that it was a difficult day, because Valteri had done fantasticly all weekend and was a real lord.
The team did outstanding work to have one-two," Hamilton said.
It was a real bad language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Feinstein on Saturday at a convention about her insistence that she did not leak Christine Blazey Ford's letter in which her High Court-renowned Brett Kavanaugh accused of sexual assault.
The president spoke at a convention in West Virginia and did not directly address the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Committee. Instead, he commented that what was happening in the Senate indicated that people were "common and unscrupulous and liars".
"The one thing that can happen and the nice thing that has happened over the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and ordinary and liars," he said.
"When you look at statements and leaks and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document--"Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak it...No, we didn't leak it," he added, in a premonition of the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter that set the charges back in July against Kavanaugh by Ford, and it was earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak from her office had come down.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations. I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But the president did not regard her denial well and made a comment during Saturday afternoon's assembly: "I tell you what.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst elevator language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court-nominated accused of sexual misconduct by three women and to suggest that the democrats use the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back with any necessary means.
You see the community, the inhospitality, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to care for to gain power and control," media reported the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer cast two targets for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars reconciled for Friday’s Elite League’s loss against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 match in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-purpose lead by throwing from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the household team together before Dwyer restored the Giants ’ leadership.
Francois Bouchard brought Dundee equal before two Luke Lundvald Nielsen's goals fixed their victory.
It was the third Elite League victory of the season for Adam Keefe’s men who had lost their first fight and when Friday night won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast.
This was the fourth convention of the season between the sides, with the Giants who won the previous three matches.
Dwyer's opening ball came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from a Kendall McFaul-help, with David Rutherford who had the help when Beauvilier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into play at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the provider for Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants took the lead in the first break when he threw his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again found them equal to a force play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran agreed to help Nielsen to let Dundee take the lead for the first time in the match in the second half and made sure of the win with his team’s fifth half-way through the final half.
The Giants who have now lost four of their last five matches are home to Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controller dying to make sure hundreds of aircraft can escape an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane carrying hundreds of people was safely lifted.
More than 800 people are dead and more are missing after a great earthquake on Friday hit the island of Sulawesi, and caused a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area, and many were caught in crimes in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues who fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower that swam heavily at the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained motionless to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the run, was able to climb safely.
Then he leaped from the traffic control tower when he daydreamed.
He later died in the hospital.
Speaker for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirat, says that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia’s ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our heart breaks to hear of this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll can reach the thousands with the country’s disaster relief agency, which says that access to the villages of Dongala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the death count is still increasing, as many bodies are still under construction, while many cannot be reached," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves that reached six feet [6 m] long, Palu smelled that Sunday would hold a mass funeral.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, bring in an ambulance body.
Clean water is scarce.
The minimals are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the Indonesian International Smoking Crusade, CNN said: "The Indonesian Smoking Crusade is chasing to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse."
Indonesia's President Yoko Widodo arrived Sunday in Palu and told the country's military service: "I ask you amai to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini says now one man is missing after a beach plane crash
The airline that handled a flight that crashed into a Pacific beach in Micronesia said now that one man was missing after they had previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had safely disembarked the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they could not account for a male passenger.
The air raid said that they were working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while it tried to land at the Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in a stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. fleet both said that the plane landed near the runway in the beach.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane had arrived very low.
"It's a special good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to walk through medium - depth water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the airtights had panicked and yelled and that he had done a small head injury.
The U.S. fleet said that creatures working close to the improvement of a key also helped with a blowable boat with the rescue to get people back and forth before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet).
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people have been killed in the past two decades in collapses of PNG-registered airports, but Air Niugini has been involved in one.
Analysts set a time line from night to night when women were burned alive
The state closed its case Saturday in the retrial of a man charged with burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice-analysis Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence-analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell records to assemble the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said that he received location data from different phones that showed that Tellis and Chambers were together on the night of her death, which was in conflict with his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's suit that night, he said, "No, because my suit was in Nashville."
Quite an inconsistency that Tellis said that he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that a little after Chambers' death, Tellis Chambers deleted messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He had rid her of his life," said Hale.
The defense was scheduled to begin its concluding Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative perspective of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip-hop moved away from its origin of political messages and the handling of social issues.
They want to go back to the foundations and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common saw a recent U.S. revival by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Just a black person?
New Babysitter is a couple of days away because she's out of "racist" text.
A New York-born girl is on her way to a party for discriminatory dismissal after she received a wrong address message from the mother who complained that she was "a pretty black person".
The couple deny that they are racists and compare the matter with "persisting."
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, a mother of two, was upset when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"NOEEEEEEEVE NEVER A Black PERSON," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Faxman to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to me twice.
After she discovered her mistake, an "uneasy" Plasco-Faxman thanked me Maurice and said that their outgoing African-American child-girl did bad work and that she rather expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Me Maurice was paid for her one day's work and then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice's day-to-day the couple for compensation for the compensation and seeks his compensation for the amount of $350 per day for the six months, housing work for which she was originally appointed, although it was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do such a good," said his Friday post and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple looked back on the claims that they were racist and said that it was the reasonable thing to end Maurice’s proposal and feared that they could not trust her after being insulted.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people," said the man Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone with whom you were unscathed, even though it was through the bush?
Your first-born father?
Come on."
Plasco compared the matter to "smoothing" and said that his wife would have a baby in two months and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going after such a person?
It's not a very nice thing to do," added the investment banker.
As the case continues, the court of public opinion was quick to bring the couple on social media and cut them off for their behavior and logic.
A new letter revealed that Paddington publishers feared that a talking bear would not involve readers
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book, said about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny that we know about Paddington's great success."
She said her father would have been hot if his work had been rejected. He was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little toy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication after his death was "bitter-sweet" last year.
About Paddington, who described her as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
"He was quite a quiet man and he wasn't an orange man," she said.
"But because Paddington was right for him, it was almost as if one had a child who had achieved something: you're proud of them, even though it's not your job.
I think he saw Paddington’s success that way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the honor to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say hello on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was hunted down to Nice’s Louis Pasteur 2 hospital where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say that it was really bad, that they did not expect her to do it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got the call from Nad to say that she would die within the next two minutes and that I had to greet her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, dear.
Soon I will be with you.
I will be with you.
The medications the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating were slowly getting up and leaving her system.
She was a little before it died and the body was closing.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was unfolding.
I couldn't cry or cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really needed to keep it together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who had been hurt by the loss of her daughter by that time, accompanied the other passengers on board the plane -- unconscious of the trial she had gone.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had my head down and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the run I got an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women post cards to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey's mail cards have been on a Wallian bridge for a while with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Me Davis’s son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at 18.
"I want no parent to feel as I do every day," she said.
Me Davis, 45, lived in Lydney and said her son was a promising boss with an offensive smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up any room."
However, he gave up work before he died because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11, found his brother after he took his own life.
Davis said, "I'm worried that there's going to be a domino effect."
Me Davis drew the cards, "to let people know that there are people out there who you can go to and who you can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit still - you have to talk."
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old husband, not long after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was sick or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
On Christmas Day he reached the lowest point - when the children opened their presents, he did not contact them or do anything to them."
She said her death was very traumatic to them, but that they had to work on it: "It was a hole through the family.
It breaks us apart.
But we must all go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh’s future has not yet been determined as the FBI investigates
"I thought if we could actually get something for which he had asked--a timeless investigation that had not been fixed--we could perhaps bring a little unity," said Mr. Flake Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee was "falling apart" under the slightest partisan accumulation.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their aversion is all due to timing.
The elections are only weeks away, on November 6, if, as it is expected, the Republicans go bad, then they will be severely weakened in their efforts to find the man they want to choose to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and whom he met with his wife Ashley and was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI has released its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 republics and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can come to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor which will allow Mike Pence, the president of the fish, to break a play and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea, we're running numbers 'down' under Kim
The number of North Korean runners to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong and seven years ago, a South Korean legislator said.
Park Byeong-seug quoted data from the South's unification cabinet and said that there were 1,127 surges last year -- compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and Shina and higher rates demanded by human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
The vast majority of runners from the North are finally offered South Korea civil rights.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flights through Shina, which has the longest border with North Korea, are easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zones (DMS) between the two Koreans.
Shina views the warriors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them with violence.
Relations between the North and the South who still speak technically in war with each other have greatly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for talks that centered around the ongoing negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons.
It came to the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed in broad terms to work together for the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho has been blaming US sanctions for the lack of progress since Saturday.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Meeting in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh " hysterical," says he is powerless to serve at the High Court
Home Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court-recognised Brett Kavanaugh "histories" and said that he was temporarily unfit to serve at the Supreme Court.
On Saturday, Pelos delivered the comment in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had ever acted like this, they would say ' hysterical'," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied charges that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both of them were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and at times he almost screamed and sneezed while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly rejected Democrats on the committee and called the allegations against him "a ridiculous and coordinated assassination", organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelos said that she believed that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court because it showed that he was prejudiced against Democrats.
"I think he makes himself unqualified with those statements and the way he followed the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelos hesitated when she was asked if she would try to appeal to Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats won the majority in the camphouse.
"I'll say it -- if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not competent to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court where he is now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Ummegang Appelhof.
Pelosi added that she was concerned as a Democrat about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Law on Costable Care or Red v. Wade as he was considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh skipped questions about whether he would overthrow certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's no time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't it wonderful,' said Pelosi.
And women have to deal with it.
It's a righteous diatribe, months and years of anger that boils, and she can't get it without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She went on, "I was helped a lot by a woman who was an executive officer somewhere, whoever said that she wept when she got angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started to cry, she would say to the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just went.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are permissible as a partial output for toum because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my strongest memories of an early job in a man-dominated office is where I once found that I cried with no name and was caught by an older woman's neck--a cold driver for whom I was a little afraid--who dragged me into a report book.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think that you are sad and will be happy, because they have influenced you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught up in an out-of-court relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and he had to leave the bars, I was very frustrated by Schroeder, realizing that there was no reason why she could not investigate the idea that she could run for president.
"I didn't think well of the decision," she said to me smiling 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the games and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves".
Because it was late in the fight, she was behind with discovery collections, and so she made a vow that she would not enter the recession unless she collected $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men would only give her $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not lead a formal campaign, she was interrupted by emotions--thankful for the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and to target voters rather than delegates, and angry for the sexism--that she had stuttered.
You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder told me about how the press reacted to her.
"You would have thought that Kleinex was my corporate loan.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my tombstone?
"She cried?"
How the US-Shina trade war may be good for Beijing
The opening voice of the trade war between the U.S. and Shina was overwhelming, and while the battle is over, a disagreement between the countries may in the long term be beneficial to Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, fired the first warning earlier this year by charging important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most interesting scale this week included new rates that affect $200 billion (£150 billion) of items and effectively charge half of the goods that come from the United States of China.
Beijing took revenge every time in good weather and recently hit the U.S.$60 billion price of five to ten percent.
Shina promised to match the US shot-by-shoot and the world's largest economy will not move soon.
To get Washington to stand back means to surrender to requests, but to meet in public the U.S. requests will be too much of a shame to Xi Jinping, Shina's president.
Experts continue to say that if Beijing is playing its cards correctly, pressure on the US trade war over the long term Shina can support positively by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a rapid political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that can start an economic toll in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than previous observers have known," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia in the middle of New American Security, a thinker.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, Minister of Foreign Affairs says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and calls for help to rebuild the land that was destroyed by war for more than seven years.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country improved.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to normal.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that their daily lives and their existence had drawn.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrian people have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the country.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that had secured the invasion.
Europe Seals Rider Cup Victory in Paris
Span Europa won the 2018 Ryder cup and Span U.S.A. with a final point from 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a driver's cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team took the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who was struggling for most of the tournament, had her T-hold in the water at the pair-3 16th gate exploded and gave his match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari blinked in all his rounds and became one of the 1-of-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament started its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was blown out by the player with the lowest rank on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The player with the world's highest rank, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to land Poulter of England who may have played in his final Ryder cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder-beakers, Spain Sergio Garcia, has become the tournament's European winner of all times with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It was a tough year.
So grateful for Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I am so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia to the European victory.
He hands over the torch to his fellow countryman John Ram who on Sunday won US-glorious Tiger Woods 2+1 in a single game.
The incredible pride I feel, to overcome Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at dai old," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has already lost four of his competitions in France and now has a record of 13-21-3-run Ryder-record.
A strange statistics by one of the biggest players of all time and he won 14 major titles second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team U.S.A. has been hard to find the cleaning field with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance on behalf of his team: "I'm proud of this spring.
There was a time this morning when we put some heat on Europe.

Hot off for Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Rider Baker Committee, and we'll move forward.
I love this 12 - year - old, and I am proud to serve as their captain.
You need to keep your hat on.
We're outnumbered."
