Members of the Wells Assembly are concerned that they will "associate themselves with maps"
Some ČA fear that it would be advisable to change the name of their post to "Member of the Wells Parliament" (MWP).
This recommendation was based on plans to change the name of Parliament Wells.
THE entire political spectrum is concerned that this can cause laughs.
One C.E. of the Labourers claimed that his group was concerned about the Roma from Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wells: in the Welsh word "twp" it means "unintelligible", and "pwp" means "defective."
C.A. from the Wells Party stated that his group was “not satisfied ” and offered alternatives.
One of the whale conservators said his group was "unprecedented" about the name change, but noted that MWP could quickly become a "map".
In this context, the word "w" is similar to the word "u" in Yorkshire.
The committee of the Assembly, which is currently drafting legislation to change the names, noted: “The final decision on the new name of the members of the Assembly will certainly be taken by the members themselves.”
Since 2017, the Wells Self - Control Act has authorized the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of the public discussion of the proposals, and the change of assembly in Parliament in Wales received broad support.
With regard to what is called the CHA, the Commission proposes to call them members of the Wells Parliament, that is WMP, but MWP has received the largest public support.
Of course, the CH offers alternatives, but trying to reach an agreement can cause problems for the head of Elena Jones, who has to submit a bill of amendment for several weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including the rules for the removal of the CH and the structure of the committee system.
A final vote will be taken on their new name when the legislation is discussed.
Macedonians are going to vote on a referendum on the country's name change
On Sunday, voters will announce whether to change the country's name to "The Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote was organized to resolve a multiannual dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The Athenians have long claimed that their northern neighbour's name is a claim to Greece, and they have repeatedly opposed Macedonia's EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who is speaking against holding a referendum on the change of name, said he would ignore the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, say that the change of name is just the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s calls are silent because Harlem’s churches are experiencing difficult times.
“The old people I was associating with say that there was a bar and a church here before,” says Mr. Adams.
Now there is neither one nor another. ”
He believes that the disappearance of bars can be understood:
"Today, people are socializing differently.
Bars are no longer like the local living room where they regularly visit. ”
As for the churches, Adams is afraid that money from the sale of assets will not be as long as the leaders expect, and “early or late they will be found where they started. ”
The churches, he added, can replace houses with condominiums, and there will live people who will not help the saints who remain nearby.
“ The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these houses will be white, ” Adams explained, “so this will speed up the day when all these churches are closed, because it is unlikely that most of those who move to condominiums will be their residents. ”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: The Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and San Martin was built ten years later.
Corinna, a white Methodist community, left in the 1930 ’ s.
The black community that held the ceremony nearby was granted the right to build property.
Saint-Marten went to the black community under the leadership of the distinguished John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of fragmented dealers on 125th Street, the main trade street of Harlem, who did not want to take part in black-skin jobs and raise them in service.
In 1939, the fire damaged the building, but Father Johnson’s parishioners wanted to rebuild it and set up a carillon.
The lovely David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martin, proudly referred to the caravan as the “calls of the poor.”
An expert who played in the Caribbean in July called it the “cultural treasure” and the “unchangeable historical tool”.
This expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also noted that it was the first in the world to be played by a black leather musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who turned 18 years ago to a larger coral in the Riverside Church.
According to Mr. Merriveser, no replacements were found in San Marten.
What is happening in St. Martin over the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some of whom were involved in church leaders, others in the Episcopal Episcopal Church.
In July, the Council, the governing body of the parishioner, composed of the leaders of the peacekeepers, wrote to the yeparchy, concerned that the yeparchy “will try to transfer expenses ” to the council by not taking part in the hire of the architects and contractors sent by the yeparchy.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the yeparchy.
The shark was traumatizing a 13-year-old boy who was chasing the lobsters in California
According to officials, on Saturday, the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him.
The attack took place about seven o’clock at Bikon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV channel in San Diego that on Saturday morning he had been drinking with his friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy calling for help, and he and the group came to him to get out of the water.
Hammel first thought it was just a catch of the caught Lobster, but then he realized that the boy was shouting, "I've been eaten!
I was given the taste of it."
As soon as he got to the boy, he saw that his key had been completely broken.
"I cried to everyone to get them out of the water, saying, 'In the waters of the shark!'," Hammel added.
The boy was brought to the Children's Hospital at Radi in San Diego, where he was in critical condition.
The species of the shark that made the attack is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles at the media briefing told me that a few weeks ago the shark was spotted in this area, but it was established that it did not apply to the dangerous species of sharks.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic damage to the upper part of the skull.
For the purposes of investigation and security, the authorities closed access to the beach from the beach of Ponto in Casablanca to Swami in Ensinitas.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to go out to the British cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is going to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with cosmetic islands similar to those in universities.
As a result of the increased entry into the British cosmetic market at the cost of 2.8 billion pounds of sterlings (continued to increase when sales of clothing and household goods are decreasing), increased islands with cosmetics will be protested in 11 stores throughout the country.
Investments in cosmetics are related to the search for ways to use the police space that used to be used under televisions, microwave ovens and household goods.
In Sainsbury's, they said that they would double the range of cosmetics and offer up to 3,000 products, for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees will get more space: there will be brand zones like those in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also updates the range of cosmetics in Boutique: now most of the products presented will not be protested on animals, as young buyers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the fragmented Fragrance Shop perfume dealer protests his sheets in two Sainsbury's stores: the first sheet opened in Croydon, northern London, last week, and the second one opened in Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and the transition to buying small amounts of food every day in small shops makes supermarkets make additional efforts to attract visitors.
Mike Kupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, said that their stores would become more like universities, because the supermarket network is trying to resist Aldi and Lidl discounts using more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's opens the Argos departments in hundreds of their stores, also opened a number of Habitats departments. Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago and claimed that it increased the sales of food and made both networks more profitable.
The previous attempt to upgrade the cosmetics and pharmaceuticals departments of the supermarket failed.
Sainsbury's tested the collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but she ended up arguing about how to divide the revenues from monkeys into supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold their pharmaceutical business (281 pharmacy) Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million pounds of sterling three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds would help add an extended range of luxury brands to skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hex, commercial director of Sainsbury, said: "We have changed the appearance of our islands with cosmetics to make the atmosphere more pleasant for our customers.
We also invested in specialized consultants who would be able to give advice.
The range of brands presented to us is called to meet any needs, and the pleasant atmosphere and comfortable locations mean that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which is a competition for the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "crazy" because Holly Willowby got out of the deal worth 11 million pounds of sterlings.
The Light Dragon star Peter Jones is crazy because TV director Holly Willowby has come out of a deal with his brand of life goods (the value of the deal is 11 million pounds of sterling) to focus on new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willowby doesn't have time for home clothes and Truly accessories.
The couple's business was related to the Goop Guilette Peltro brand.
This morning's 37-year-old leader announced her entry to Instagram.
Holly Willowby took Peter Jones’ Light Dragon star to the last moment when she left their profitable business for life to focus on new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources report that Jones is "crazy," when a golden girl from the TV admitted to a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of the Johns' business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deal worth 1.5 million pounds of sterling means that she no longer has enough time to dedicate it to their joint brand of household clothing and accessories to Truly.
This business was linked to the Goop Guilette Peltrow brand and had to double the Willowby ship, which is estimated at 11 million pounds of sterling.
When 37-year-old Willowby reported on Instagram coming from True, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source reported: “Truly, no doubt, was Holly’s main priority.
He was to become her long - term future for the next few decades.
Willowby’s decision to get out of the business surprised all the interested parties.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, almost before the start.
In Marlow's headquarters, full of things ready for sale.
Experts believe that the entry of this morning guide, who is one of Britain’s highest - paying stars, could have cost companies millions of dollars because of large investments in goods (from pillows and candles to clothing and household clothes) and create further delays with the launch.
This can also mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children, Willowby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tari Kapp, for ten years.
Willowby and Kapp created True in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as the head of the board in March.
The money was spent together, Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's stock, which is a television company.
Willowby will be the ambassador of the M&S brand and will replace Anthony McPartlin as the leader of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
The source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his case."
A hard talk, “And then we fell in love ”
He joked about the criticism he received from the news media for a comment that someone would consider "unpresiding" and for a very positive attitude toward North Korea's leader.
“Why did President Trump go for such a big deal? ”
Trump said, in imitation of the voice of the news. —
I didn't do anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearization went into the deaf corner.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's leading diplomat, Rei Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "response" from the United States for its first disarmament steps.
Instead, he noted that the U.S.
When he gave the talk at his meeting, Trump was much more optimistic.
"We have a good relationship with North Korea," he said.
We were going to fight with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have such a wonderful relationship. ”
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had led to positive results: the completion of missile tests, the release of hostages, and the return of the remains of American military personnel.
He also protected his unusual approach when talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to act as presidents, but instead of 10,000 people on the street trying to reach this battle-stricken stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there," said Trump, pointing out to the crowd right in front of him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated the islands, hundreds of people killed
In particular, after the earthquake in Lomboca, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need help.
Although more than 10 percent of Lomboka’s population were affected, the national disaster was not declared, and this is a prerequisite for international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it is somewhat difficult,” said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children, he is gathering a team to travel to Pala, until it is unknown whether foreign personnel can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a representative of the National Disaster Relief Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities appreciated the situation in Pala, to determine whether to allow international organizations to provide assistance.
In view of the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains terribly unprepared for the wrath of nature.
In the province of Aceh, caves are built from tsunamis, but they are not typical of other coasts.
The apparent absence of the tsunami warning siren in Pala, although the warning was effective, probably contributed to the death.
Moving between countless Indonesian islands is not just the best time.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The medical ship that was in Lomboca for the treatment of earthquake victims swims to Pala, but it can reach the site of the new disaster at least three days later.
President Joco Widodo has improved Indonesia's infrastructure as a basis for his campaign and has increased road and rail costs.
But the lack of funding created problems for Mr. Joko's administration, which is planning to change next year.
Mr. Joko also inhibits the long interfaith enemy in those parts of Indonesia where Muslim majority members have chosen a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have died, tens of thousands have been evicted from their homes as a result of the opposition of Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets using machetes, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.

The police called to answer people who saw or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is now in early stages, but I'm asking everyone near John Street in Birkenhede to contact us.

The statue of Cromwell near Parliament is becoming a new memory that suffers from "rewrite history"
The removal of the statue would be a payment for the destruction in the Taliban-style of many of the cultural and religious artifacts of England, performed by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Community called Mr. Crick's proposal "crazy" and "by attempting to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Community, said: “The fact that the statue of Oliver Cromwell at the Westminster Palace will be a mix was inevitable, taking into account the current debate on the removal of the statues. ”
An iconic battle during the English civil war was not carried out by Cromwell himself or by his order.
It is likely that Cromwell will not be worthy of being sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The great statue of the Cromwell sculptor William Hamo Tornecroft is a testimony to the moods of the 19th century and part of the character's history, which many think is still worth respecting.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many who are probably more likely at the end of the 19th century than now consider Cromwell to be the defender of parliament from outside pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Whether such an idea is entirely accurate is the subject of long - lasting historical debates.
There is no doubt that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the well - known figures that represents one side of this conflict.
His achievement as a protector-lord should also be noted and respected."
A pig-killer took a Chinese farmer to death
According to local media, the farmer was attacked and killed by pigs on the market in southwestern China.
The man, identified only by the name of John, was found dead in blood with a broken artery near a pig market in Ljupanshuy, Guičhow province, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
In China, China, China, on May 30, 2005, a pig is about to be vaccinated in a pighouse.
It is reported that on Wednesday he left with his cousin from the nearby province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the brother found him dead and saw that the door of the pighouse was open.
The brother noted that there was a large blood-thirsty cab in the pighouse.
The ship's medical expertise has confirmed that the 249-pound cab has taken the farmer to death.
“My cousin’s legs were in the blood and were distorted, ” said a two-armed brother named Wu, quoted as Guiyang Evening News.
The security footage showed that John entered the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man did not belong to Joanna or his twin brother.
The market manager told Evening News that when the police gathered evidence on the scene, the pig was locked up to prevent its attack on people.
It is reported that seven of me, Juan, and the market administration, are discussing compensation for his death.
Even rarely, however, there have been cases of swine fever in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and injured a man.
Ten years before that pig weighed 295 pounds [295 kg], she held a whale farmer pressed to the tractor until the farmer’s wife frightened the animal.
After the Oregon farmer ate his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer said the CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can be a triger.
"They're just playful.
They're like kids, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with proper respect, ” he said.
The remains of the Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread floods to the southwestern United States
As predicted, the rose hurricane is weakening, moving above the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Rosa will bring rains with floods to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Rose had wind speeds of 137 km per hour (this Hurricane Category 1) at 5 a.m. east time on Sunday and was 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
In the meantime, over the Pacific, an investment that is moving east to the west coast of the United States is beginning to be formed, and as Rosa approaches the Pacific Peninsula on Monday, as a tropical storm, she begins to push strong tropical humidity north to the south west of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 25.4 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Then, in the next few days, the tropical humidity that interacts with the approaching task force will create strong floods in the south west.
In this area, between 2.54 and 10.2 cm of rain will result in dangerous flooding, garbage flows, and the possibility of landfilling in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will increase the number of places to 5 to 7.6 cm per hour, especially in some parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
5 to 10.2 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the south-west, especially in the vast Arizona area.
Flood floods are possible when conditions are rapidly deteriorating because of the widespread nature of tropical rains.
We strongly recommend not to go to the desert foothills because tropical floods are possible.
The heavy rain can make the canyons blizzards, and the dangers will result in frequent winds and dust storms.
The closeness of the deposit will cause heavy rains in some parts of the northern coast of California.
The number of wastes can exceed 1.27 inches [1.27 cm], which can cause massive waste streams and shale roads.
This is going to be the first rainfall in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical floods will begin to approach Arizona late on Sundays and mornings on Mondays and evenings on Mondays and Tuesdays.
The heavy rain will go over the For Corners from Tuesday to Wednesday.
In October, intense temperatures can be observed throughout the U.S. territory, as the Arctic is getting colder, but the tropicals remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to sharp drop in temperature at short distances.
A fine example of the sharp drop in temperature in the central U.S. can be seen on Sunday.
It's almost a 7 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, the state of Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De-Moons, the state of Iowa.
During the next few days, summer heat will try to return and spread.
It is expected that in the vast area of the center and east of the United States there will be heat by October, and the temperature from the southern levels to some parts of the north east will be 27 degrees Celsius.
The temperature in New York can reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees Celsius above the average temperature.
According to our long-term weather forecast, there is a high probability of a rise in average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavano’s hearing
On Thursday, more than 20 million people on six television networks watched the exciting testimony of the candidate for the post of Judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano and Christine Blaise Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual violence, which apparently occurred in the 1980s.
Political opposition continued, channels interrupted the planned programs to report on the latest Friday news: a deal prepared by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake on the FBI's weekly investigation into the charge.
Ford told the Senate Court Committee that she was 100% sure that Kavano was drinking her and trying to get her clothes off at a party in the senior school.
Coffee in his emotional testimony said that he was 100 percent sure it wasn't.
It's quite likely that more than 20.4 million people were watching this Friday, as Nielsen's research company reported.
The company calculated the average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Unable to get the numbers on other networks immediately, which also showed listening, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has problems with measuring the number of people watching television in offices.
For comparison, such an audience of a size is similar to an audience that looks at the game of the playoff series or the Oscar award.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported the Kavano assignment, was the leader of all the channels during the day’s hearing, with an average of 5.69 million viewers recorded in Nielsen.
ABC was the second of 3.26 million viewers.
According to representatives of Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after listening.
Flake became the central character of Friday's drama.
The office of this moderate republican issued a statement that he was going to vote for Kavano, and then on Friday morning CNN and CBS recorded how protestors shouted at Flek when he was trying to get on the elevator to the hearing of the Court Committee.
He was standing with his eyes down for a few minutes, during which he was being licked, which was broadcast directly on the CNN.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” said one woman.
You think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said to him, "You have authority, but the women are without strength."
Flake reported that his office had issued an application and added more to the hearing committee before the elevator closed.
All cables and broadband channels broadcast directly hours later when the Court Committee had to vote on the promotion of Kavano’s candidacy to the Senate in full.
Flake said he'd do it only if he knew that the FBI was going to file charges against the candidate next week, which the democratic minority requires.
Flekka was partly convinced of the talks with his friend, Senator Chris Kuns.
After talking to Kuns, and then with several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flekka’s choice had an impact, since it was obvious that the Republicans would have no votes to appoint Kavano’s candidacy without investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation into charges against Cavano.
British Prime Minister Teresa May accuses critics of "games in politics" around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "games in politics" with the future of Britain and of undermining national interests.
On September 29, 2018, British Prime Minister Teresa May attended a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom.
In another interview that came up next to Theresa's interview on the front page of the paper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson criticised her so-called Chequers plan on Brexit, saying that to propose Britain and the EU to tighten the fees of each other "absolutely absurd".

The volcano throws ashes on Mexico City
The dust that discharges the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern regions of the capital of Mexico.
The national disaster warning center on Saturday called for Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, since the crater began to operate and 183 gas and ashes were recorded in 24 hours.
The center has been tracking numerous noises and currents.
In the picture, social media features thin layers of ash on a lobe glass of cars in the area of Mexico City, such as Mr.
Geophysicists have noted the increase in volcanic activity at 45 miles (72 km) to the southeast of the capital, after an earthquake of 7.1 balls in central Mexico in September 2017.

Police met with Catalan separatists before the polling anniversary for independence
Six men were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protestors who were taking their stand for independence met with the police department, and thousands joined protestors to celebrate the first anniversary of Catalonia's division vote.
A proseparatist group in the masks held by the specialists cast them with eggs and a dusty paint that created dark dust clouds on the streets, on which usually full of tourists.
The fights took place and later that day, the police used the sticks to stop the attack.
A few hours later, a group of independence supporters, who were chanting, “We won’t forget, we won’t forgive!”, met with supporters of the country’s conservation, who shouted, “Let Spain live!”
According to a local press report, fourteen people were helped by the mild injuries they suffered during the protests.
A year after the October 1st referendum, which was recognized by Madrid as illegal but marked by Catalan separatists, the tension in the region that wants independence remains high.
The voters generally decided to vote for independence, but the appearance was low because most of those who opposed the division had boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year as a result of police efforts to stop voting in polls throughout the region.
The independence groups spent Friday night in tents to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but we had to take another route.
68-year-old Narcissus Termes, an electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope that Catalonia could gain independence.
"Last year we survived one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out with joy that they can vote, but now we are in a deaf corner, ” he said.
Despite the vital but very difficult victory of the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan parties that stand for independence were unable to preserve the momentum of this year, because many of their most famous leaders are in voluntary expulsion or imprisonment for their participation in the referendum and further declaration of independence.
Hoan Puege, a 42-year-old mechanic who took a protest in favor of the police on the phone, said that the conflict was caused by politicians on both sides.
"Tension is increasing," he said.
On Saturday, Ariel Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders, who is in a subsequent insulator at the end of last year, announced that he will be in the European Parliament next year.
"The status of the candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and repression that we see from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: The men were arrested after the car went into the house
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after the car went into London's house several times.
The incident took place at Ballinagarde Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in British Standard Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings noticed that the door and the house were damaged.
It is quite possible that at some point the car was shot from an Arballet.
Manga hit Lionstone to win the Rangers with an account 1-0.
The first goal of Dolly Mengi in the Lionstones became a winner
The high-ranking Lionstone has shocked Rangers and brought Stephen Gerard a second defeat of 18 games as the manager of the Eibrox Club.
The Dolly Menga hit proved decisive: Harry Holt's team rose to one level from the Hibernian in a second.
The Gerard team won no victory at the Premier League this season, and the next week it plays with the Harts leaders, from which it leaves at eight points.
Earlier on Thursday, Rangers will be admitted to Rapid Vienna under the European League.
In the meantime, Lionstone continues its invincible move to six games in the division, and coach Holt has not yet suffered defeat after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
"Livingston" misses the chances of missing guests.
The Holta team was supposed to have been ahead of them long before they were killed, because their straightness creates Rangers all kinds of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through through the defense, but he hit the door, and then Alan Litgou broke through the door after he pushed and took a hit by Craig Halkett along the door he had made with his head.
The owners were pleased that they had allowed Rangers to play before them, and they knew that they could cause problems to the guests from standard positions.
A decisive goal was killed.
Rangers missed a free shot, and Lionstone opened, Declan Gallagher and Robinson took over Menga, who took the ball and killed him from the crime scene.
To this stage, the Rangers were dominated by a ball, but the protection of the hosts of the field proved to be unbreakable for them, and Liam Kelly's doorkeeper was mostly not concerned.
This trend continued in the second time, although Alfredo Morelos was able to strike Kelly.
The impact of Scott Pittman on his legs was reflected by the Rangers Allan McGregor. Litgou hit the door in another standard combination of Lioningston.
The nuns were constantly on their way to the Lionstone Penitentiary and were constantly neutralized, and two applications were rejected after Halkett’s attack on Glenn Middleton, who had been replaced, and behind the game.
Lionstone phenomenon: analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena stadium
The phenomenal game and the Lionstone result.
All of them played well, they continued to exceed expectations on this eastern trajectory.
Their game style and composition have not changed since they returned to the highest level, but the proper Holt must be given for the way he mobilized the command after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett played a great game, organized the defense very well, and Menga forced Connor Goldson and Joe Warral to remain vigilant.
Rangers, however, had no inspiration.
They used to play very well under the guidance of Gerard, but now they are far from reaching those standards.
They didn't have enough last ball -- only once they broke down the defense of the landlords of the field -- and it was something like the Rangers wake up, which was in the middle of the table.
Erdogonna was widely accepted in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, the sky was filled with laughter and blue.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to restore relations between NATO allies.
They have raised some issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new sword.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
From a security point of view, the police didn't let 25,000 people meet in front of the mosque, but many of the president's supporters showed up close to see him.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan — many Kurds among them — also made themselves heard, condemning Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to invite him to the country.
Bilateral protests testify to the diversity of the guest that some German Turks called a hero and others a dictator.
A road accident in Defford: a biker died in a car crash
The biker died in a car crash in London.
There was an accident near the crossing of Beshud Street and Evelyn Street on a live road in the district of Deptford in the south-east of the city about 10:15 a.m. after British standard time.
The driver stopped by, and the paramedics arrived at the scene, but the man died in the spot.
This accident happened a few months after another biker died after a driver escaped from the crash site at Childers Street, about 1.6 km from the accident on Saturday.
The London police reported that they were working on establishing a man to inform his closest relatives.
Tours are banned and bus routes are changed, and drivers are recommended to avoid this area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six Prisoners Trapped in Violations
Six prison staff were injured as a result of a man's incarceration, the prison administration reported.
The interference in her Long-Lartin prison in Woostershire began at about 9:30 a.m. on the British standard Sunday and is still ongoing.
To stop the attacks initiated by eight prisoners and located in one wing, a special branch of Tornado was called.
The officers were given medical assistance in connection with the minor facial injuries received at the scene.
A prison official commented: "In order to resolve the incident that persists in her Long-Lattin High Prison, specially trained prison personnel have been engaged.
Six collaborators received medical attention in connection with injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we will make it clear that those responsible will be sent to the police and the lines of their stay behind the bars can be extended."
In her Long-Latin prison, more than 500 prisoners, including the most dangerous lawbreakers in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison chief was sent to the hospital after the arrest.
In October last year, a special police department was called into custody to stop serious incidents in which prisoners were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with floodwaters.
Tropical depression rarely strikes Arizona, but this can happen at the beginning of next week, because the remains of the Hurricane Rosa run through the southwest of the desert, causing the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of floods on Monday and Tuesday in the territories from West Arizona to South and East Nevada, South-East California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, and Monday night will be rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression within 200 miles (322 km) from Phoenix since 1950,
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) from the Arizona border.
According to the latest forecasts of the National Centre for Hurricane Victims, in the Mogollon-Rome region of Arizona, there is a drop of 5.08 to 10.16 cm and a drop of 15.24 cm.
Other areas of the southwest of the desert, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to get from 2.54 to 5.08 cm of rainfall, possibly up to 10.16 cm.
Where there is no risk of floods, the rain of Roses can be a blessing because the region suffers from drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of them will probably be useful because the southwest is now experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Dry Monitoring Centre, some 40 percent of Arizona’s territory suffers at least from extreme dryness, which is the second highest dryness category, reports weather.com.
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa leads to the shifts on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
Rosa, on Sunday morning, still in force at the maximum wind speed 137 km/h, is 620 km/h from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 19.3 km/h.
The storm is meeting with colder waters in the Pacific Ocean and is thus weakening.
In this way, it is expected that when a tropical storm strikes in the morning or in the evening, the hurricane will cause an earthquake in Mexico.
The number of falls in some parts of Mexico may be significant, causing a significant risk of floods.
“The total number of falls from Lower California to North West Sonora is expected to range from 7.62 to 15.24 cm, with places up to 25.4 cm,” reports weather.com.
Then Rosa goes north through Mexico as a tropical storm, gets to the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression that goes further through Arizona and late at night on Tuesday morning gets to South Utah.
“The main danger expected from Rosa or her remains is the very strong rains in Lower California, North West Sonor and South West American Desert,” reports the National Centre for Hurricane.
These rains are expected to lead to life - threatening floods and waste streams in the desert, as well as droughts in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton's attack: four people were arrested who committed a murder plot.
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspected murder after they found a 16-year-old boy with knife wounds in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in the Excelsior-Terras district in Midsomer-Norton at about 4:00 p.m. on the British standard Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained in a stable condition.
17-year-olds, two 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested at night in the Radstock area, Aveon and Somerset police reported.
The police are asking everyone who can have any video footage of these events on the phone.
Trump says that Cavano "tolerated anger and anger" of the Democratic Party
“A voice for Judge Kavano is a voice against the ruthless and repulsive tactics of the Democratic Party,” said Trump at a meeting in Wiling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Cavano had "tolerated anger and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the process of hanging.
Kawano witnessed before the Congress on Thursday, inseparably and emotionally denying the accusation of Christine Blaise Ford that he committed sexual violence against her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness at the hearing of the charges against her.
On Saturday, the president stated that on that day “the American people saw the splendor, character and courage of Kavano.
"The voice of Judge Kavano is the voice of one of the most accomplished lawyers of our time, a lawyer with an unbreakable experience of the state service," he said to a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president repeatedly mentioned the expulsion of Kavano when he spoke about the importance of the Republicans in the Middle East elections.
"In five weeks there will be one of the most important elections in our lives.
I don’t run, but I really run, ” he said.
That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
Trump claimed that the democratic mission was “to resist and hinder”.
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavano's candidacy will take place no later than Friday, the CNN assistant of one of the Republican leaders reported.
Hundreds of people have died from earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, rising numbers of victims
At least 384 people died, many washed up in the ocean when the giant waves broke down on the beach as a result of an intense earthquake and tsunamis on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the country’s authorities announced on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were resting at the beach festival in Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters (18 feet) in the hills broke down on the shore, killing many to death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami took place after the earthquake with a force of 7.5 bullets.
“When the tsunamis were threatened yesterday, people were still busy on the beach and not immediately started running away, and they became victims,” said a briefing in Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a representative of the Indonesian disaster relief agency (BNPB).
“It wasn’t just tsunamis, it moved cars, trees, houses, it hit everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that, before it hit the shoreline, tsunamis passed through the open sea at 800 km/h (497 miles/h).
To save from the tsunami, some people went to the tree and survived, he added.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Pala.
Aerial photos published by the disaster relief agency show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been turned and destroyed, and the sword is surrounded by water.
The raids in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes affected an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said that the energy released as a result of a massive earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical position of the city at the end of the long, narrow bay could have contributed to the power of tsunamis, the agency said.
He called it a “wide - scale disaster ” and noted that thousands of buildings, hospitals, shopping malls, and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found under the cracks of damaged buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing without a message.
Nuguro noted that victims and injuries could be more than 300 miles (190 km) along the shoreline north of Pala in the area called Donggal, which is closer to the earthquake.
“The lines of communication were completely damaged, and we didn’t get any information, ” said Nugroho.
There are over 300,000 people living there, says the Red Cross statement, and it adds that his staff and volunteers traveled to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it can get a lot bigger," says the report.
On Saturday, the agency received extensive criticism because it did not report that the tsunami had hit Pala, although officials said that the waves had arrived at the time mentioned in the warning.
In an amateur frame shared by people on social networks, it is evident that a man on the top of the building is warning crazy about the tsunami approaching people on the street under the building.
A few minutes later, the water wall fell into the shore, taking the building and the car with it.
Reuters could not immediately verify the reality of the footage.
Earthquake and tsunamis have caused a serious switch off of electricity, which cut off the connection around Pala, which has complicated the coordination of rescue operations.
The military officers began sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities reported, but evacuated people still need food and other necessities.
The city airport was opened only for help, and it will be closed until October.
President Joco Widodo was to visit the evacuation centers in Pala on Sunday.
The number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia exceeds 800.
That's very bad.
The co-workers of the World Vision organization from Dongala have successfully reached the city of Pala, where they hide in the breezy tents located in the courtyard of their office, but on the way they saw the scenes of desolation, Mr. Doseb said.
"They told me they saw many broken houses," he said.
That's very bad.
Even when relief groups have taken decisive action to eliminate the effects of the disaster, some have complained that the workers of foreign humanitarian aid with great experience are not allowed to go to Pala.
According to Indonesian rules, financing, supplying and providing staff abroad can only begin if the site of the disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“ It is still a disaster at the province level, ” noted Aulia Ariani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says, "Well, it's a national disaster," we'll be able to accept international aid, but this status is not yet provided."
It was the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, and the friends and families of those who had not yet been found were still hoping that the appearance of their loved ones would be a miracle that would decorate these clouds to catch up with natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy got out of the sewer room.
On Sunday, the rescuers received a woman who lay under the rock for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Hendon Subandono, a coach of the Indonesian national team from paraplaneism, trained two missing paraplanetists to participate in Asian games that had taken place earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other paraplanners who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandaga, were his disciples.
"As an elder in paraplannerism, I have my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Hendon relates how a few hours after the news of the destruction of Roa Roa, which spread among the paraplanner community, he was desperate to send whatsApp to the Pala rivals who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked only by one gray hook, not by double blue hooks.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Stealers took $26,750 while filling the ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, the thieves stole $26,750 from Brink's employee, who ran a ATM at Newport on the Levee, reported to the Newport Police Department.
The driver emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and prepared to add more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the news.
While he was busy, another man “run back to his co-worker Brink ” and stole a bag of money to fill it.
The Witnesses noticed a number of suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not indicate the number of participants.
Anyone who has information about these people should contact the Newport police number 859-292-3680.
Canya West: Reper changes his name to Yes
Reper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
On Saturday, when he announced a Twitter change, he wrote: “Before officially known as Kanya West.”
The 41-year-old West was sometimes called the Y, and he used this abbreviation as the name for his album released in June.
The change took place on the day before his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new Yandhi album.
He replaced Ariana Grande's singer, who cancelled her participation because of "emotional reasons," said the author of the show.
This is not just a shortcut to the current professional name, West used to say that the word has religious significance for him.
"I believe that "it" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you,"" told West early this year, discussing the name of his album with the radio-leading Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
The canyon, which means "one," was cut to simple Yes, it's just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are."
Kanya is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Daddy, and Grandpa, announced this year that he had chosen the name Love and Brasser Love.
A former colleague of West, Jay-Zy, also experimented with the defacement and large letters.
Mexico President Andrés Manuel Lopes Obrador promises not to use an army against civilians
Mexico's newly elected president, Andrés Manuel Lopes Obrador, has promised never to use an army against civilians.
On Saturday in the area of "Tlatelolko" Lopes Obrador promised "never to use an army to suppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, the military launched a peaceful demonstration in the field, killing about 300 people, and the left student movement began to be established throughout Latin America.
Lopes Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening more free state universities.
He noted that unemployment and the lack of opportunities for education lead young people to criminal groups.
US$ double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
Since China is increasing the activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. has to double the amount that they spend on research in this field, the investor and practice in the field of Shi Kai-Fu Lee, who was working on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were made after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about the IT, although in the U.S. there is no formal IT strategy at all.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it wants to become No. 1 in the field of IT by 2030.
"The double SHI research budget would be a good start, considering that all other countries are far away from the United States, and we are preparing for the next SHI breakthrough," Li said.
Double funding can double the probability that the next great achievement in the field of S.I. will be made in the United States, Lee said in an interview with the CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book The Netherlands of China, Silicon Valley and New World Order was printed this month, is the director general of the Sinovation Ventures fund, which invested in Face++, one of the most famous Shi companies in China.
In the 1980s at Carnegie-Mellon University, he worked on the S.I.S. system that won the best American player at Otello, and later was executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee noted previous U.S. government-led technologies, such as the Robotics Challenge Agency for Advanced Defence Research Projects (DARPA), and asked when they would be next to help identify future prospective participants.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win state grants, says Lee.
"It's not China taking academic leaders, it's corporations," he noted.
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have been hiring light from universities to work on IT.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to increase its efforts.
"I think the Green Card should be offered automatically to the candidates for science in the field of IT," he said.
The State Council of China published its Plan for the Development of the Artificial Intelligence of a New Generation in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Fund provides funding to people working in academic institutions, just like the National Scientific Fund and other U.S. government organizations are giving money to American researchers, while the quality of academic work in China is below, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence set up a Joint Intelligence Centre to involve industrial and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Intelligence Committee.
Also this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
With regard to the National Scientific Fund, he is now investing in the research of IT over $100 million a year.
In the meantime, the U.S. legislature, which wanted to create the Commission from national security of artificial intelligence, has not taken any steps for several months.
Macedonians voting on a referendum on the change of country name
On Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to "the North Republic of Macedonia", which will allow for a multiannual dispute with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's ability to join the Euro Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the northern neighbour is a claim to its territory, and has vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, two governments entered into an agreement on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents of the agreement said that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovak majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he wouldn't vote on the referendum, and the boycott campaign raises doubts as to whether it would be possible for the voters of at least 50% to consider the referendum to be effective.
The question in the referendum's bulletin is, "Do you support NATO and EU membership under the terms of the agreement with Greece?"
The name changers, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, say that the price that Macedonia, one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, should be paid for the entry of bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young of Macedonia, so that she could live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not a legal commitment, enough Members of Parliament have stated that they support it to make it decisive.
To change the name, two thirds of Parliament's votes will be required.
The State Electoral Commission stated that by 13:00 there were no reports of violations.
However, there was only 16% compared with 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of registered voters threw their ballots in the polls.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said 62-year-old voter José Tanevski in Skopje's capital.
On September 30, 2018, in Stromica, Macedonia, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, his wife Zorika and his son Duško gave their vote at a referendum on the change of name of the country, which will pave the way for NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and placed a chair in front of tents organized by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with a proud head, not through the service door," Kvardark said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us to Macedonia, we can turn to others, for example China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zayev believes NATO membership will bring much of the investment needed in Macedonia, where unemployment is more than 20%.
"I believe the majority voted for, as more than 80% of our citizens speak for the EU and NATO," said Zayev after the vote.
He noted that the result of “yes ” would be a confirmation of their future.
According to a survey published last Monday by the Institute of Political Research in Macedonia, 30 to 43% of the voters will participate in the referendum, which is the result below.
According to another survey conducted by the Macedonian telecom Telma, 57% of respondents are scheduled to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the appearance must be 50% plus one vote.
The defeat of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the policy of the Western government from the beginning of May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City takes over all of Briton's defense and kills the target.
Serchio Aguero and Rahim Sterling took the Briton defense and brought Manchester City to victory with an account of 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
The goal of Aguero at the 65th minute of the match looked ridiculously simple.
The Argentine attacker received a belt at the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Briton defenders and found himself in the open field.
Then Aguero realized that he was surrounded by four greens.
He walked through one of the defenders, then ran over a few more on the edge of the Briton.
Then he made a pass to the left, seeing Sterling.
The English foreman made his first touch on the fine to hand over the Aguero ball, which with his right butt left him on the right side of the gate, defeating the Bryton-Brayon-Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some leg problems," said journalist manager of City Pep Guardiola.
We agreed that he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he killed the target at this point. ”
But the initial advantage of the blue sky in this game of the Premier League provided Sterling.
This was a 29th minute.
Aguero got a ball deep in Briton's territory.
He sent a beautiful penetrated belt along the left flank of Leroy Sane.
Leroy made a few touches and then made Sterling's belt in the direction of the further pole.
The Forward of the Sky-Blues threw a ball into the door just before he went abroad.
City will meet Hoffenheim in the team stage of the Championships League at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhine-Neckar Arena Stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to take away the eyes of Rokis
Since the Washington Nashionals team came out of the playoff, there were no significant reasons to wait for the turnoff.
But Sherzer's competitive attitude is expected to go out on Sunday in the games against Colorado Rockis, provided that Rockis still has trouble going out to playoffs. Now Rockis is playing one game ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League.
"Rockis" at least has a wild card for winning the 5-2 victory over "Nashionals" on Friday night, but they still want to strengthen the title of the first division.
"Despite what we're playing for, at least we can leave the ball knowing how the viewers are doing here in Denver, and the other team will probably play at the highest level I've seen this year.
Why would I not want to take part in this contest?
"Nachionals" will still find out who will be the first painter on Sunday, but it is reported that they tend to be Shercer.
The sugar, for which it's going to be the 34th start, took place on Thursday at the Pitching session and could play Sunday, usually its way out.
The Washington right has a result of 18-7 out of 2.53 ERA and 300 strike cars at 220 2/3 inches this season.
Tromp Meetings in West Virginia
The president repeatedly mentioned the situation around his candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano when he spoke about the importance of the presence of Republican supporters in the Middle East elections.
"All we've done will be put on the map in November.
Five weeks later, one of the most important choices will take place in our lives.
It's one of the big, big ones — I'm not running, but I'm really running, so wherever I can, I fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they're firmly set up to give power back, using any means, you see hypocrisy, corruption.
They don’t care who suffers from them, who need to pass through to gain authority and control, they want authority and control; we’re not going to give them that. ”
The democratic mission, according to him, “to resist and hinder”.
"And you have seen it for the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "bad and vile, disgusting and false."
He mentioned the Senate Judicial Committee, calling Senator-Democratic Diane Finstein by name that caused the audience to be discontented.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you give the document?
Uh-huh.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting -- that was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a large church.
It is intolerant to those who express their thoughts.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to condemn me, it almost turned out to be a surprise.
Finally, I'm the last of those Labour Members of Parliament who have been told they don't like it, and that's because we're expressing our opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, in Parliament, was almost the same because she was determined against anti-Semitism.
I was sentenced for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, these issues are ironically similar to those that Jeremy did not agree with before.
On Friday, the Nottingham East Labour Meeting said, "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
Most of the Friday evening meetings of the General Committee for my eight years as a local member of Parliament from the Labourers were the same.
Unfortunately, today many meetings have a completely different tone, and the promise of a "more kinder, more softer" policy has long been forgotten if it has ever been realized.
It is becoming increasingly evident that there are no differences in views in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged from the position it is acceptable for the party to be run.
This began soon after Jeremy became leader, and colleagues with whom I had previously felt that I had similar political views began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and accept positions that I would never agree with, whether national security or the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak in public — and it doesn’t matter what I say — there’s a chain of attacks on social networks, with calls for withdrawals, the condemnation of central politics, I’m told that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I've been happier than some of my colleagues, because I'm usually getting political comments.
I am pleased with the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who daily face the flow of sexual or racist attacks, but never refuse.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbin said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer such a large church, and with every movement of mistrust or change in the rules of choice, the party is narrowing down.
Over the last two years, I've received a lot of advice, and I've been called not to shout, not to say so loud, so that "it's all right" with me.
But I didn't come to politics.
I joined the Labourers 32 years ago as a school student, because because of the lack of interest on the part of the government of Tetcher my class in high school had literally collapsed, since then I want to improve the quality of state services for those who need them most, whether local councillor or government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, including in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East has questioned my political views and differences with today’s leadership.
For those who contributed to Friday's events, I only want to say one thing: in the circumstances when the country is marching to Brexit, which will harm home governments, businesses and state services, I don't understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Liberian Party.
Actually, I have another message, but not for the Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters, as members of the Labour Party, and not for me: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat to recall me or any political benefit will make me act in accordance with what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.

"Eir" 38 - 17 "Melrose": Unbeatable "Eir" climbs up
The last two attempts may have distorted the final result, but no doubt the Air won a triumph in today's great entertainment match, the Premiership of Scotland.
Now they're leading the table, it's the only unbeatable team out of ten.
Finally, the excellent defense and improved ability to use opportunities gives the hosts and coach Peter Mercie the right to be fully satisfied.
"We've been testing our games so far, and we're still unbeatable, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose commented: "I see fit "Ere," they used better chances than we do."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, made by Frasie Klimo, led to "Eir", but a yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, published by "Verriers," allowed Melrose to show the figures, and Jason Baggott used an unrealized attempt.
The climate strengthened Air's leadership through the Penalties, and immediately before the break, made and performed a solo test, which gave the 17-5 account for Air.
But Melrose was a good start with the second time, and the attempt by Patrick Anderson, made by Buggot, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to the serious trauma of Ruarid Knott, which was brought out of the field on his nose, and the Eyr was pulled forward by the Stafford McDowell, which was realized by Klimo.
Captain Air Blair McFerson then had a yellow card, and again Melrose forced another player to pay for Bruce Colvin's unrealized attempt under intense pressure.
The masters returned, however, when Stroan Hatchinson received a yellow card for the capture of Klimo without a ball from the police station line, Makferson made a tachdown behind the Eyr mill.
The climate was trying to do almost every time after the start, and then Kyle Row got hit by David Armstrong in the box and sent Gregor Henry's flanger to the fifth attempt by the master's team.
Looks like a still game star set to a new restaurant career
It looks like Ford Kiran's still game star is set to a new hospitality career. This conclusion can be made after it has been known that he is the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor, Jack Jarvis, is playing in the popular BBC TV series, a script he writes to, and in which he is recorded with his former comedy partner, Greg Hemphil.
Duet announced that the future nine series would be the last in the show, and it seems that Kirnan is planning life after Craiging.
According to the official record, he is the director of Arifingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although the source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan wanted to enter the "prominent restaurant business" of Glazgo.
"The Sea of Ours" is the interior of Bolivia, hoping that the court will find its way to the Pacific Ocean.
Marines are patrolling the fleet headquarters in La Pasi.
Public buildings raise the ocean-blue flag.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted by the wise man: “Our sea is right.
We must return it.”
In Bolivia, which has no way out of the sea, there's still a memory of the loss of the coast line that went to Chile in the 19th century curve conflict through natural resources, and there's a desire to swim again in the Pacific.
These hopes are probably the strongest in recent decades, because Bolivia is awaiting the decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of hearing the case.
“There is a momentum in Bolivia, there is a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, it expects a positive outcome,” commented Roberto Calsaday, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many sufferers will observe the announcement of the ICU's decision on large screens throughout the country, and they expect the Hague tribunal to take a decision for Bolivia that will force Chile after decades of sectional talks to negotiate Bolivia's sovereign sea exit.
Here Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faced opposition to his conversion the following year, also has great hopes for a decision that will be announced on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly make a decision for Bolivia, and if that happens, there will be little change.
The United Nations based in the Netherlands has no authority to condemn the Chilean territory and has noted that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
What the ICU's decision to make only six months after the final arguments were made indicates that the case was "not difficult", said Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Bolivia’s case has not been resolved, and the last four years have been able to contribute to the recovery.
"The question of access to the sea was used by the Bolivian administration today," Zarate said.
The warrior rhetoric of Morales undermined the remains of Chilean kindness, she admitted.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but then it will be very difficult to discuss.
The two countries did not exchange letters since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Wells, a representative of Bolivia, in The Hague, disagreed that the court’s decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will receive “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to end 139 years of differences with mutual benefit, ” he said.
Calsadia also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America — used the sea question as a political force.
“ Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific, ” he added.
This decision is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind. ”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen if it can't trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ree Yong Ho says his country will never give up its nuclear weapon before it can trust Washington.
On Saturday, Rei spoke at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during the summit in Singapore by the leaders of rival countries.
His comments appeared when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the threshold of relaunching nuclear diplomacy that entered the deaf corner more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Chen In.
Rei says that the belief that the continuation of sanctions and the U.S. opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will eventually put North Korea on its knees is a “unrealized dream. ”
Washington is afraid to adopt a declaration before Phenyan takes significant steps towards disarmament.
And American President Donald Trump wants a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that Phenyan takes seriously the rejection of his arsenal, which the country probably considers to be the only way to guarantee his safety.
Pompeii plans to visit Phenyan next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris’s fashion shows presented the latest trend of mass main clothing, which is already heading toward the main streets of your city
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely hide from the sun, you have found what you need.
Valentine's and Tom Brown's designers have demonstrated a number of eccentric main outfits in the spring-summer 2019 collection on the stage of a brilliant Paris fashion week.
Many impractical hats filled Instagram this summer, and the famous designers have already sent their memorable creations outside the building.
Valentino was wearing an extravagance running hat with a wide, decorated pear fields that covered the heads of the models.
Among other things, the top accessories are decorated with precious coffee stones, the hat of a witch and even the hat of an ananas, but they're not to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated an assortment of original masks — very soon before Halloween.
Many of these colored masks had protected their lips and were more remembered by Hannibal Lecter than by high fashion.
One creature recalled the underwater navigation equipment with the tube and the glasses, the other looking like a piece of ice cream that had melted.
And if you support this serious fashion request, you're lucky.
Stylists say that huge hats can go out on the main streets of your city.
Oversize hats came into fashion thanks to La Bombi, a straw hat with a width of 60 centimeters that they saw on everyone: from Ryanna to Emily Ratazkovski.
The cult brand, which stands behind a very impractical hat, which was seen everywhere in social networks, gave peace to another creature: a salty beach bag of almost the size of a model in the bathroom that carried it.
The yellow-red raffle with raffia and white leather handle was the central element of the La Riviera collection spring-summer 2019 brand Jacquemus in Paris' weekly fashion.
Famous Stylist Luke Armitaz told FEMAIL: “The following summer, I expect to see large hats and beach bags on the main streets of the city, because the influence of the designer is so huge that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for overpass accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of the language required for the citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland support high standards of education, and in 2018, excellent results were again received, complementing individual and collective achievements in sports, art, music and other fields.
These schools, which teach more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCN) and aim to provide the best level of service for students and their parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for further and higher education that they have chosen their careers and make them the citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable for choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak the language she understands, she understands it.
If you speak to her in her native language, she will take it to heart. ”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot use only English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the final results of this year’s exams, we see that in independent schools, languages are leading the rankings of subjects with the best grades.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages received higher A.
Data gathered at 74 NHRC schools showed that 72% of students received higher A from Chinese and 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French, and 63% of those who studied Spanish also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland consider foreign languages to be vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language as an object of choice is now being taught in the same way as that of NTMM (scientific, technical, engineering, and mathematics), in independent school programs, and in other institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Employment and Training Commission in 2014 showed that 17% of the reasons why employers can't close their vacancies are due to a lack of language skills.
So language skills are becoming more and more necessary when preparing young people for a future career.
Since more and more promising positions are in need of language skills, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
Regardless of your chosen career, if someone learns another language, he'll have a real advantage in the future, because it's a lifelong habit.
The possibility of direct contact with people from other countries automatically gives a person who owns several languages, the advantage over competitors.
According to a survey of over 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75% could not speak in a foreign language well enough to support the conversation, and the French language was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15%).
That is why investment in language teaching is now important to modern - day children.
Knowledge in several languages, especially in developing countries, will give children more opportunities to find full employment.
In Scotland, each school will study its language.
A number of schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important to Britain from the 2020 perspective, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests in independent schools, you can always choose several languages to study with qualified teachers.
Scotland’s independent schools are trying to create a educational environment that prepares and equips children with the skills needed to achieve success regardless of what the future prepared them for.
Now we can't deny that in international business environments languages continue to have vital meaning for the future country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be regarded as “the skills of international communication. ”
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, variety, and perfection for young people in Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is director of the Scottish Independent Schools Board
Lebron debuts from Lakers in San Diego
Fans who want to see LeBron James' first start at Los Angeles Lakers were almost there.
Coach Lakers Luke Walton announced that James would play Sunday in the first pre-season match against Denver Naggets in San Diego.
How many minutes will he play, it's not decided yet.
"It'll be more than one and less 48," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell reported that James would soon play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season Lakers games.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare," he replied.
Tromp Meetings in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is now launching a series of election meetings from the city of Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of five meetings scheduled for the next week of Trump's meetings, including meetings in friendly states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote for the candidacy proposed by him to the Supreme Court is postponed, and Trump wants to form support for the future Middle East elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is it going to be for today’s Trump evening meeting in West Virginia, and how can we view it online?
Meeting Trump in Willing City, West Virginia, scheduled for 19 hours east today, Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch the Trump meeting in West Virginia online below in a direct affair on YouTube.
The Trump is probably referring to the tensions of hearings that have occurred this week as a result of bringing the candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano, accused of sexual harassment, and the delay in the Senate's vote for a week while the FBI's investigation is ongoing.
But the main purpose of this series of meetings is to help Republicans to become popular before the November elections.
President Trampa's representatives said that these five meetings next week were aimed at "activating volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to save and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reported.
"Congress control is so critical to its agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible, because the tension of the pre-election campaign is approaching," said Tramp's representative, Reuters, who did not want to name his name.
Today’s meeting at the Wesbanko Arena stadium in Willing can be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as by the Pittsburgh media, reports West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday's visit will be the second in the last month of Trump's visit to West Virginia, where he won more than 40% of the votes in 2016.
Trump is trying to help a candidate from Republicans to the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morris, whose rating is lagging behind.
“ It is not good for Morris to come to the president to raise his rating in the polls, ” commented Reuters Simon Heather, a politician at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder 2018: U.S. team set up to fight and hopeful for Sunday singles
After three sessions, which ended with a unilateral victory, Saturday afternoon forces can become the same as what was missing in this Ryder Cube.
An emergency impulse maker is a well - thought - out sports concept that players really believe in, especially in similar competitions.
So when do they say that the pulse works?
"They were ahead for six points, and now for four, so I think we'll take it a little bit as an impulse," said Jordan Spit when he left.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points ahead and twelve more in the game.
The Americans, as Spit says, feel a little wind in their glasses, too much to encourage them, not least the shape of Spitt and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each earned three eyes out of the four.
Sleeping with his killer blows from the same midwife to the grin shows an example.
These shrill shouts of celebration became louder as he continued his round made a decisive pact and compared the score to the fourth match after he and Thomas were out of sight.
His patent, which allowed them to win a match on the 15th of August, met a similar scream, which tells you that the American team doesn't seem to.
"You really just have to try very hard and worry about your own match," Spit said.
That's all each of these players left right now.
18 Moons to Be Known
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days — Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fletwood — the unmistakable story of Cube Ryder.
An unusual but charming couple from Europe have four out of four and cannot be mistaken.
Mollywood was the only couple who didn't make Gods on Saturday afternoons, and they also managed to avoid Gods on Saturday mornings and after lunch on Fridays and on the last nine lunches on Friday mornings.
This race and how their energy seems to flow to this rebellious crowd and back, makes them believe that they win on Sunday and that there will be no more popular players, except Flitwood or Molinari, to strengthen the potential victory of Europeans when the sun comes over Le Golf National.
I'd like to be at the same time in different holes.
However, talking about the triumph of the Europeans is still early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson got rid of Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning forbolts when he was married to Alex Norren.
One god and two dolls on the first nine dolls brought Spanish and Swedish to a doll from which they could never get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you get out of the hole.
It is very interesting to observe the forewords and forsoms closely through the interaction between the couple’s participants, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and how the strategy can change in a moment.
While Europe is playing better than a team and has a significant advantage in the last day, this session of the Forsoms has also shown that the U.S. team intends to fight what some, especially Americans, doubt.
Europe's leading 10-6 on the last day of Cube Ryder.
In the final day, Cuba's Ryder Europe will have a solid advantage, because after Saturday's forbolts and forsomas it's ahead of the United States with an account of 10-6.
The inspired duet of Tommy Flitwood and Francisco Molinari won two victories over the remaining Tiger Woods, and now on Le Golf National they have four balls.
The European team Thomas Bjorn, who was trying to return the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in the morning forbules with account 3-1.
The U.S.A. made more resistance in the forsoms and won two matches, but couldn't cut the gap.
Jim Furick's team needs eight points in 12 Sunday singles to save the trophy.
Flitwood is the first European novelist to win four points of the band, while Mollywood and Mollywood are only the second pair to win four points in the first four matches in the history of Cube Ryder.
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in the forbolts, they joined together to win the long Woods and the new American Brison Deshambo with even more efficient 5th4.
Woods, who drew two matches on Saturday, demonstrated random sparks of genius, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in forbolts and forsomas and seven matches in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not take part in the morning forums, returned to his partner, Henrik Stanson, in the Forsomas, to win a defeat with 2t1 from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who is the first and third in the world ranking.
Europe has not been able to do everything in its power to do this pleasant new day in the south-west of Paris.
Three major winners of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas on Saturday set a standard for Americans with their two eyes.
They won a decisive victory over the Spanish John Ram and Ian Poulter in the Forbola and later beat Poulter and Rory McClroy with a 4th 3 in the Forsomas, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Cube Ryder, the team has returned with a deficit in four points in the singles, although the Furick team is only needed to save the trophy.
However, after the second place for two days, the contraction on Sunday seems to be out of their reach.
North Korea says that "no way" will be disarmed in a unilateral order without confidence
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea announced on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions would deepen mistrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country could not refuse its nuclear weapons.
Rei Yong Ho told the annual UN General Assembly that in the past year, North Korea had used "substantial good will measures", such as the cessation of nuclear and missile testing, the dismantling of nuclear testing sites and the obligation not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technologies.
"One day, we don't see a proper reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will never be the first to disarm ourselves on a unilateral basis."
And while Rei repeated the well-known North Korea complaints of Washington's "stepping" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea will be rewarded for its progressive steps, his statement was important that it did not deny the unilateral denuclearization that was done by the Phenyan in the past.
Rei made a joint statement by Kim Chen Inn and Donald Trump at the first in the history of the summit between the real president of the United States and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on 12 June when Kim called for work on the "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula", and Trump promised security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea is looking forward to the formal end of the Korean War 1950 - 53 years, but the United States has stated that Phenyan must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington also resists calls for a reduction in the severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. is insisting on "denuclearization at first" and increasing the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal violently, and even denying the "declaration of the end of the war," said Rey.
“To think that sanctions can put us on our knees, ” is the unreal dream of those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust. ”
Rei did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader stressed at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings of Kim and South Korean leader Muen Zheyin in the last five months and added: "If the side of this issue of denuclearization were South Korea, not the United States, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be such a deaf angle."
Despite this, Rei's tone of speech was sharply different from that of the previous one when he told the General Assembly that targeting North Korea's missiles to the U.S. mainland was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim "a human rocket", who wanted to commit suicide.
This year, in UN Trump, which threatened to “completely destroy ” North Korea, Kim praised the courage to use disarmament measures, but said that much more would have to be done, and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea’s denuclearization.
In the middle of Trump, he noticed that he was not setting a time frame for this: "It will take two years, three years or five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council is to reward the Phenyan for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompey told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council sanctions should continue energetically and relentlessly until we see complete, final, confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has consistently increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 with a view to blocking the financing of nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeii met Rei at the United Nations General Assembly and then said that the following month he was visiting Phenyan again to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeii visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was a failure.
He left Phenyan in July and commented that progress had been made, but in a few hours North Korea condemned him for “gangster requirements. ”
During the meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to break down the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States were to use “appropriate measures. ”
He told Kim that he said he needed “appropriate measures” to guarantee the security that Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps to normalize his relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has given all of his students more sleep, and it's an attempt to combat the growing culture of the fatness of learning all night after cooking caffeine.
The professor found that the number one students in the world are often uneducated when it comes to the basics of how to care for themselves.
Charles Chester, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Women’s Hospital in Brigham, has developed a course that he believes is the first such course in the United States.
He decided to start a course after giving a lecture on the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the day, a girl approached him and said, "Why are you telling me this now at the last class?"
“ She told me that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep that surprised me, ” said a lecturer from The Telegraph.
At the course that was first introduced this year, students explain the basics of how good sleep habits help to achieve academic and sports outcomes and improve overall well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of Harvard Medical Psychiatry and executive director of medical services at the University, explained that the university decided to take a course after it was found that students were seriously out of sleep during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a room in a classroom where students click cups of coffee, pots, coaches and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, the effect of sleep deficits on sports indicators, and the importance of sleep-related routine.
Another chapter tells participants how chronic sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
The map of the campus with interactive icons further encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change students' behavior immediately.
But we think they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the consequences of smoking cigarettes for health," added Professor Chester.
The culture of pride for “sleeping all night ” still exists, he added, and noted that modern technologies and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is growing.
A good quality sleep must be a student’s “secret weapon ” to cope with stress, fatigue, and anxiety, even with a set of extra weights, because sleep deprivation translates the brain into hunger, which causes constant physical hunger, he says.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chesler to develop a course after he enrolled in one of his other courses last year in Harvard during the first year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the whole campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to appeal to all graduates with a request for a similar training program to enter a competitive institution.
Professor Chesler recommends that students be reminded of the need to sleep, as well as to set up a house and be aware of the harmful influence of "blue light", which is emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps, and which can disrupt the Circadian rhythm that leads to sleep problems.
Lionstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengi's goal was to upset Gerard's boys
The Rangers survived a round attack of the roadside sadness: the Dolly Menga hit brought Stephen Gerard's different team a 1-0 defeat from the Lionstone.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first victory in the final match after the February triumph of St. Johnston with a score of 4-1, but the Harry Holt team beat Gerard as a manager of 18 games. The Gerard team remained at eight points behind the Scottish Prime Minister Harts.
Manga was killed in seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, who lacked inspiration, didn't seem to be able to balance the account.
Now the Rangers have come down to sixth position, and the Lionstones have gone up to third, and by the way, they're just going to be promoted to "Hibernian".
In addition, Rangers may have another problem, because the liner Kalum Spence was forced to treat the head wound after he was thrown into the guest sector.
Gerard made eight changes in the team that had once crossed the Air in the semifinal of the Scottish League.
And Holt released the same set of "Levia 11," which took one point to "Harts" last week, and was delighted that his trained boys were pushing their opponents at every step.
The Rangers may have been dominant in the control of the ball, but the Lionstones worked more with the ball they had.
They were supposed to kill everything in two minutes of the game when Menga's first belt in the free zone allowed Scott Pittman to hit the door of Allan McGregor, but the defender wasted this great chance by sending the ball through the door.
Keagan Jacobs' deep-free hit got his shooter Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Litgou hit the backstand.
Rangers really got control, but the last third was more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos, of course, felt that he should be entitled to a penalty four hours after he met Stephen Louless, but Stephen Thompson’s reference rejected the Colombian.
The Rangers were able to do only two first-time knocks, but the former Ibrox doorman Liam Kelly hit Lassani Kulibali's head and the Oviya Ejaria's calm kick almost uneasy.
And while the 34-minute pass of the Lionstone goal may have been in conflict with the game, no one can deny that they only earned it by their hard work.
Rangers couldn't handle Jacobs again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent a ball to Scott Robinson, who calmly chose Meng for a simple finish.
On the break, Gerard replaced Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately worked when the Hungarian broke into Morelos, but the impressive Kelly pulled him off his line to block him.
However, Lionstone continued to force guests to play in a game they liked when Litgou and Halkett made one long pass after another.
The Holt team was able to improve the outcome in the last few stages, but McGregor was well against Jacobs before Litgou hit the corner.
Glenn Middlton, a replacement for Rangers, made another later application for a fine when he met Jacobs, but Tomson took a look again.
German: Geiger's inventor
And now the page from our Sunday morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago that day, and the time is coming... in Germany, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Haiger was born.
Heager developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactive radiation, an invention that eventually evolved into a device known as the Heager counter.
Since then, the Geigers have become one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of pop culture, for example in the 1950's "Corondo Bells" movie with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play doubts like cowboys.
The man said, “What is this all about? ”
Rogers: "This is the Heiger counter used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can really hear how the atoms are affected by the radiation in the minerals. ”
Evans said, "Well, it's really going to crack right now."
Hans Haiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see and kill malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells that are part of the treatment
The method predicts the elimination of immune cells in the patient and their change in the laboratory
Then these cells are able to see proteins that are common to many types of cancer.
The test vaccine has many promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, ovarian cancer has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells in a patient, changing them into a laboratory so that these cells can "see" common to many types of protein cancer (HER2), and then re-introducing these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute Bethesd, Maryland, noted: “Our results show that we have received a very promising vaccine. ”
"HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovaries, lungs and colorectal cancer," he explained.
A similar approach, which involves removing immune cells in patients and “learning” them to target cancer cells, has worked to treat one of the types of leukemia.
After the appearance of the SNL show at the MAGA canyon West, he gave a sharp speech in support of President Trump,
what caused the negative reaction of the viewers?
The viewers of the SNL (Saturday Night in the Direct Epherical) show saw Kany after his sumbular speech, during which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced that he would be fighting for the presidential post in 2020.
After performing the third song called Ghost Town in the baseball game with the title "Let's Return to the American Past Glory," he exploded with a tornado in which he criticized the democrats, and said again about his support for Trump.
"How do you like Trump? He's a racist."
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL show began with the sketch of Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood star scoffed at Brett Kavano's testimony he gave to the Senate Legal Committee on the subject of a call from Christine Blaise Ford about violent sexual activity.
Although the West’s speech was not broadcast in the direct effigy, the video with its wire featured comics, Chris Rock, on the social network.
It is hard to see if Rock wanted to mock West by placing this post.
The West also complained to the viewers that he had been hit by an unpleasant situation because of his clothes.
According to the Washington Examiner, West said, "When I was behind bars, I behaved cruelly.
I was told, "Don't go out to the viewers in this baseball game."
They abused me!
And then they tell me I'm in a place where the oppressed keep quiet."
West continued, "You want to see where the oppressed keep quiet?
Then try to treat each other with love."
According to Variety weekly, his comments at least twice caused a negative reaction from the audience in the hall, and the actors at the SNL seemed to be ruined.
The last minute, the news invited Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper McMiller, was killed in a few days ’ time.
The West called in many surprises, performing song I Love It (I love it) in the Perrier bottle suit.
The news was supported by the head of the conservative organization TPUSA Kendes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "One of the bravest: Thank you for standing up against NATO."
Instead, Karen Gunther's leading show wrote on Twitter that the West is who he is, and that's just great."
"But I will not reward it (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his "art") who, in my opinion, confesses and rejects an ideology that harms my society.
He's a free man.
Like us," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name: now he's "the one they used to know as Canya West."
West is not the first performer to change his name.
Snoop Dog's fellow rapper was formerly called Snoop Lion, and, as you know, the music legend of the last decades has changed the name of Prince as a symbol, and then became an Artist, formerly known as Prince.
Accused of a plot of intentional murder after an assault with a knife at the Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after being stabbed by another man in one of the restaurants of East Belfast on Friday.
The police reported that the incident happened at the Belligekamor restaurant.
It is expected that the accused will be brought before the court of magistrates of Belfast on Monday.
The prosecutor's office is considering the charges.
The Star of the Game of the Thrones, Keith Gerington, condemns the idealization of brutality.
Kitt Gerington became famous for the role of a warrior with the sword of John Snow in the brutal medieval fantasy series "Game of the Thrones" of HBO.
However, the 31-year-old actor in the performances condemning the stereotype of the hero, claiming that because of such heroes on the screen, young boys often seem to have to be cool enough to be respected by others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture Kit, he said that "something went wrong" and asked how to solve the problem of idealization of brutality in the era of the #MeTo's popularity.
Keith, who recently married his colleague on the Games of the Thrones, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, noted that he's "resolved enough" to deal with this problem.
"I'm set up pretty resolutely at the moment, when we're on a slippery path to idealizing brutality?" he asked.
"Why do we teach future men if we look at their growth through the grip of the problem that we see now?"
Kitt believes that television is partly responsible for the popularization of brutality through the images of extremely brave heroes.
He continued, "What is natural, and what are we planted?
Why does TV and the street teach that young boys feel pressured to be such men?
I think it's really important today to ask, "How do we change this?"
'Cause it's obvious that the young guys have fallen off the right track.'
In an interview, he also noted that he would not be filmed in any of the "Games of the Thrones" screenplays after he finished the show next summer, because "he's already done with battles and horses."
In November, Keith will play the play "Real West" by Sam Shepard, a story about the filmmaker and his brother.
As an actor has recently confessed, he respects meeting his wife Rose the best she's ever had in the "Game of the Thrones" series.
"After the shooting in this series, I met my wife, so he gave me the future family and defined my future life," Keith said.
In a fantasy show that won the Emmy Award, Rose played Igritt, a hero named Gerington John Snow.
The couple took off in June 2018, and the ceremony took place in the territory of the Lesley family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a sharp increase of 14% in new cases of disease
China reported a sharp increase of 14 percent of people with HIV and AIDS.
According to health authorities, more than 820,000 patients are reported in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases of disease were reported.
In most cases, the disease was transmitted by a sexual route that shows a change in the past.
For a long time in some parts of China, HIV was rapidly spreading through infected blood at the time of transfusion.
However, according to official health authorities at the conference held in the province of Yunnan, the number of people infected with HIV fell to almost zero.
However, compared with the previous year, the number of HIV and AIDS patients in China increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
The decriminalization of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but the LGBT community often suffers from discrimination.
According to research, between 70 and 90 percent of men who have sexual relations with other men continue to marry women because of conservative values in the country.
In most cases, transmission of the disease occurs as a result of improper use of the protective equipment during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide free access to HIV drugs, thus partially solving the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the angry data of the Republican senators in the network by her staff and strongly criticises "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, condemned the voter statements that one of her staff had posted personal data from three American republican senators on their pages in Wikipedia.
A Democrat from Los Angeles claims that these statements are spreading "ultra-rights" to political viewers and websites.
"A lie, a lie, and then a more disgusting lie," said Waters in Twitter.
Public information was reported to have included domestic addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Greem from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Getch from Utah.
Data appeared online on Thursday, and they were posted by an unknown person from Capitol during a hearing in the Senate commission on charges of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavano, a candidate for the post of judge of the U.S. Supreme Court.
Data leaks occurred some time after three senators questioned Kavano.
The Hill reported that on conservative websites such as Gateway Puntit and RedState, there was information that the IP address of the source was linked to the Waters office and that it was able to locate the data of its staff member.
"These baseless statements are absolutely false, they are not true," Waters continued.
"The employee of my office, whose personal data and security are put at risk as a result of these fabricated and false statements, has no relation to the source of this information.
These baseless statements are absolutely false, they do not correspond to reality."
Waters' statement was quickly discussed in the network, including former White House Secretary Ari Flischer.
"This denial is full of anger," Flyscher wrote.
"It suggests that with such a nature she cannot be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, there is no need to be angry.
The accused should not act presumptuously.
He should not question the motives of the accuser.
He must remain calm and unmoved."
It seems that Flischer conducted parallels between the Waters reaction and the democratic criticism of Judge Kavano, who was accused of looking too angry at hearings on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a candidate from the Republican Party who is struggling to take the Waters place after the interim elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"That's the news if it's true," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters noted that her office had already reported "responsible state authorities and law enforcement authorities on these false statements."
"We will do everything we can to find the guilty," she continued, "and they have responded to the law for their actions that are harmful and dangerous to all my employees."
A review of the film "Agent Johnny English: New Mission" is a passing parade of spy fighters with Rowen Atkinson
It's already been a good tradition to look into every new British movie of thought, inspired by Brexit, which is also part of a new series of comedy parades for Johnny English fighters. The first film called "Johnny English" came out on screen in 2003, and later the series was resumed in 2011 by shooting "Johnny English: Restart".
Is it going to be a ridiculously ironic self-satisfaction on what we are short-lived, new export potential of the nation?
Either way, Johnny English with his movable face and eyelids suddenly got the opportunity to make a mess, but his name more than anything else indicates that this comic character was created for viewers in non-English countries.
As you know, Johnny is an unquestionably fun secret agent, in which, despite his strange efforts to be gallant and charming, there's a little bit from Inspector Clouseau, a little from Mr. Bin and a lot of things, from that guy who played one note of the song from the movie "Fireshoes" at the opening ceremony in London in 2012.
The figure is also a traveler and a mystery of an international scale that has always been left behind by the disorder that Atkinson once played in a long - forgotten TV advertisement by Barclaycard.
In the last movie about Johnny English, there's a couple of good moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny Ingless approached the helicopter in his facial clothing, and the helicopter’s shovels were drenched about his helmet.
Atkinson's talent is well-discovered, but it's a passing humour, and at some point it's too much, especially when compared to "serious" movie brands, like "Agent 007" and "Mission Impossible", one of the "ingredients" that is also a comedy.
It seems to me that jokes are more about children than about adults, and I don't think that stupid attacks with Johnny England are as inventive and thought - provoking as those of Atkinson in their movies about Bin.
As always, the film begins with a serious threat to Britain.
In the British supersecret spy network, a hacker penetrates and exposes the names of all field agents, which has become a complete surprise to the active agent. (Unfortunately, Kevin Eldon played only an episodic role in the film).
This proved to be the last drop for the prime minister, a proud person who has already experienced destructive criticism and is in deep depression because of the loss of popularity. (Emma Thompson was trying to give the best of the image that Theresa May had, but the script was unable to fully discover it.)
The investigators informed her that all the active agents were compromised, and she needed to hire someone from a distance.
The choice is for the uncompromising Johnny English, who is now a teacher in some super-modern institution and is informally teaching children operating undercover (in this part with the Spanish "year school" for teenagers there were several great jokes).
The English are quick to deliver to Whitegol for a term briefing, where he meets again with his multidisciplinary friend Buff, who plays Ben Miller in a row.
Buff is now married to the captain of the underwater boat (the role of an ambitious sick person is not entirely in line with Vicky Pepperdin’s talent).
So when everything in the Secret Service of Her Majesty went to shake, "Bethman and Robin" returned to the strike and suddenly met the fatal woman Ophelia Pistoletto, who played by Olga Kurilenko.
And at this time, the Prime Minister is under the spell of a charismatic billionaire who has earned his stock in technology and technology and claims that he can remove the problem with the British network -- the loathsome Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacey.
The English and Buff go on their journey and go back to their ridiculous adventures: they make fires in the fancy French restaurant; they continue to sow chaos, illegally going abroad on Volta's luxury hunt; the English has a real mess as they try to use the veil of virtual reality to learn about the planning of Walt's house.
All stops lead us to the last episode, but by his kindness and madness, he reminds us of a movie for children.
It's a passing movie.
As with other movies about Johnny England, I asked myself the same question: Could the British film industry not offer Rowen Atkinson the role that really matches his talent?
The Labourers refuse to prepare a plan that says the British will work four days a week, but they'll get a salary in five days.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbin has to discuss a radical plan that the British will work four days a week, but they will be paid in five days.
It's reported that the party wants to oblige the company's leaders to transfer the costs saved as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution, giving them additional output.
In this way, workers will have a three - day weekend and will pay the same wage at home.
According to the sources, this idea will be in line with the party's economic programme and will direct the country's resources to support the working class.
The four-week shift was approved at the British Congress of Trade Unions, which shows that workers will be able to benefit from a change in the economic situation.
The Labour Party's source reported the Sunday Times: "The policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
The idea of a four-day working week is not going to change everything overnight, but it is the Party's approach to changing the balance of economy in the interests of workers, as well as the general industrial strategy of the Party."
The Laborists did not first approve of the idea because the Green Party promised to introduce a four-week work week during the 2017 pre-election campaign.
However, not all members of the Labour Party now approve of such a desire.
Speaker of the Labour Party said, "The political program of the Party does not provide for the introduction of a four-week work week, so now we don't consider this idea."
Chancellor John McDonnell presented his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy on the pre-election march of the Labour Party last week.
Mr. McDonnell said he's set up to take power back from the "unreal directors" of municipal businesses and "winners."
The chancellor's plan also means that the water supply company's shareholders can get not all their share of the capital if the Labour Government takes the "recalculation" on the basis of imaginary violations.
He also confirmed the intention to include employees in the management of companies and to create inclusive equity funds to transfer 10% of ordinary shares to private sector companies that expect annual dividends of up to 500 pounds of sterling.
Lindsey Greem and John Kennedy tell us at the 60 minutes (60 minutes) show whether the investigation of the Kavano case, led by the FBI, can change their mind
In connection with the investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavano, who leads the FBI, the final vote for his appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court is postponed for at least a week.
At Sunday's show 60 minutes correspondent Scott Pelly asked the senators of the Republicans John Kennedy and Lindsey Greem if the FBI could find something that would change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
'Yes, of course,' said Kennedy.
During the hearing, I told him that I had a conversation with Judge Kavano.
I called him after everything happened and the charge came out, and I asked him, "Did you really do it?"
He was determined, firm, uncompromising."
It seems that Greem's thinking is not going to change anything.
"I believe that the removal of the Kavano charges is a provocation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know what: Brett strongly denied everything," added Graham, addressing Christine Blaise Ford.
And anyone she calls can't confirm it under oath.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't understand what can change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and how can it affect poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival – an annual event in the music world with an amazing number of star performers and, at least, an exciting mission – to combat poverty worldwide.
At the seventh Global Citizen Festival, tens of thousands of people will rush into the Great Bay of Central Park, not only to enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendez’s performances, but also to focus on the real purpose of the festival – organizers will want to fight the extreme form of poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is the continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international civil society organization that hopes to eradicate poverty by means of an increase in the number of people who will actively fight it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you don't want to pay the VIP ticket), visitors have to do a bunch of tasks or "actions" like learning in a volunteer project, writing an e-mail to the world leader, making a phone call or anything else to help pay attention to the organization's goal of eradicating poverty.
So are there any results yet, since the Global Citizen organizers have been left behind for 12 years?
Is it really an idea to reward for the actions of a free concert -- a brilliant way to convince people to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "climbism" when people feel that something is really changing by signing an electronic petition or by making a publication on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, they have recorded 19 million "acts" of their supporters aimed at achieving different goals.
The organization claims that these actions have moved world leaders to declare planned financial allocations and programs totalling over $37 billion, which by 2030 will help change lives to more than $2.25 billion.
At the beginning of 2018, the group set out as an example the results of its 390 financial commitments and public statements, with at least 10 billion already collected and spent.
According to the group, the cost has already directly affected some 649 million people around the world.
Among the main financial commitments are the The Power of Nutrition Fund, which is territorially related to Britain. As part of the project, investors and developers have undertaken to "help children grow up" and have promised to give Rwanda 35 million dollars of assistance to deal with malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 messages on Twitter from Global Citizens.
"In order to support the government of Britain, the media, the governments of other countries and citizens of the world, such as you, we can make the social problem of malnutrition a minor fact of history," said The Power of Nutrition Tracy Ulman, a representative of the organization, speaking before the audience at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also stated that after 5,000 "actions" that called for improvements in the diet of mothers and children, the UK government announced that the cost of the The Power of Nutrition project was being spent to improve the diet of 5 million mothers and children.
In answer to one of the popular questions on your website, "Why do you think you can overcome the extreme level of poverty?"
Global Citizen representatives wrote, "This is a long and difficult path, so sometimes we fall and fail.
However, like the participants in civil rights and apartheid, we will succeed, because together we are stronger."
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janell Mona, is only part of the star performers who will be performing this year at the New York Festival, and will be hung by Deborah Lee Ferness and Hue Jackman.
Minister of Interior stated that the U.S. could use military-sea forces for "blocks" to prevent the export of Russian energy
According to a quote from U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, quoted in Washington Examiner, Washington, Washington, Washington, U.S.A., "for the sake of necessity" Washington can use the military and marine forces to prevent the outsourcing of Russian energy to markets, including the Middle East markets.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in the conflict in Syria, especially where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a reason to explore new energy sources.
"I think they're in the Middle East because they want to become a mediator in the energy trade, as they're already doing in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the employer, there are ways and means to solve the problem.
"With U.S. military forces, it is possible to ensure free passage by sea routes and, if necessary, to block them so that Russian energy is not placed on the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event, which was conducted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-commercial organization that stands as "the voice of every consumer" in the United States.
He then compared the approaches to trade with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually similar.
"The economic strategy for Iran and Russia in general is that we use energy efficiently and replace it with alternative," he said, calling Russia "one-sidedly developed", because its economy depends on mineral energy.
While these claims were being ludicrous, the Trump administration set the goal of increasing the export of compressed natural gas to Europe by exerting pressure on the Russian energy market, a much cheaper option for Europeans.
For this purpose, the employees of the tramp administration and President Donald Trump themselves are trying to convince the German government to reject the "inappropriate" project of construction of the "North Stream 2" pipeline, which, according to Tramp, will make Berlin a Moscow hostage.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 gas is worth $11 billion and that it doubles the existing gas capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, an exclusively economic project.
Kremlin is convinced that Washington is being fiercely opposed to the project just for economic reasons, which is an example of unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we share the idea that energy cannot be a pressure tool and the consumer should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry, who took place in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position called for a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
The German Leading Organization of the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI) called on the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I don't like it when a third country interferes in our supply of energy," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Association of German Industry, after the last meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren "will think seriously" about taking the president's office in 2020
The senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that "he's going to think seriously" about hitting the president's post after the interim elections.
During a meeting with the public in Goliok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering the possibility of postponing his candidacy.
The Hill Warren reported: "It is time for women to go to Washington and set up a government job, and for this to happen, there must be a woman on his forehead."
"After 6 November, I'm seriously thinking about putting my candidacy into the president's office."
During a meeting with the public, Warren expressed her appreciation of the presidency of Donald Trump, saying that he "runs his country not in that direction.
"I'm extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren was open, criticizing Trump and offering him an application for the post of Supreme Court judge, Brett Kavano.
On Friday's tweet Warren wrote, "...no doubt, before the FBI vote, we have to investigate."
However, according to the polls published on Friday, the majority of Warren's voters do not believe that it should be fought in 2020.
According to the survey conducted jointly by the Center for Political Research at the University of Saffolk and the publication of The Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the potential voters in Massachusetts opposed the nomination of the senator.
Thirty - two percent supported the move.
The results of the survey showed that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supportive.
During the discussion of the candidacy of other well-known democrats, which can be fought in 2020, they also call former vice-president Joe Baiden and senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Byden said he would make a decision by January.
Sara Paylin mentions the TRSR Trek Paylin at a meeting in support of Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Trek Peline spent the year in Iraq after joining the military service in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my son's going through now, what he's going through after he's back, can only understand other families who are experiencing the effects of the PTSR and other health problems that our soldiers are returning home with," she said to the participants at the meeting in support of Donald Trump in Tals, Oklahoma.
Pailin called the Trek arrest "a problem that no one pays attention to" and said that her son and other war veterans "are not returning home as they were before, more cruel, and want to know if they respect what their pick-up soldiers, pilots and other military officers have done here."
According to a spokesman for the Vassilla Police Department, Dan Bennett, Treka was arrested Monday in Vassilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as with preventing reports of violence and carrying weapons in a state of alcohol arrest.
18 states and districts in Colombia support asylum policy charges
Eighteen states and the county of Colombia support the accusation of a new U.S. policy that victims of gang persecution and domestic violence refuse to grant refugee status.
According to NBC News, representatives of the 18 states and the county have sent an analytical note to a court consultant in Washington to support a caller who needs shelter and accuses the court of politics.
The full name of the caller in the Grace v. Seshnes case, following the call of the American Union for the Protection of Civil Rights, in which the federal policy is being challenged and filed in August, is not being disclosed.
The caller said her partner "and his violent sons-bandits" hit her, but the U.S. citizens refused her when she asked for shelter on July 20th.
She was illegally detained in Texas.
Public prosecutors who support the call of Grace said that the inhabitants of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala (of which refugees often seek refuge in the United States) often face serious problems such as banditism and domestic violence.
The new policy of granting refugee status differs from that of the 2014 Immigration Appeals Council, according to which immigrants without documents fleeing domestic violence could apply for asylum.
The District Attorney General Carl Reissin said during his speech on Friday that the new policy "is ignoring the decade of state, federal and international law."
"The federal law requires that the decision on the application of refugee status be based on the facts and circumstances set out in such a statement, and the prohibition violates this principle," says the Court's analyst.
In the analysis, prosecutors further argue that a policy that prohibits immigrants from entering the U.S. is damaging the economy of the country, as they may become entrepreneurs and "fill the necessary labour resources".
Attorney General Jeff Seshns issued an order in June for immigration judges that they could no longer grant refugee status to those fleeing from domestic violence and banditism.
"The title is given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution in connection with race, religion, nationality, membership in certain public groups or political views," Seshns said in his presentation of the June 11 policy.
The purpose of providing shelter was never to solve all the problems, even the serious problems that people around the world face each day.
Rescuers desperately try to find those who are still alive, while the number of those who have died in Pala has doubled
For those who remain alive, the situation continues to deteriorate.
"The situation is very tense," says a 35-year-old mother, calming her boy with a riot at the evacuation center of the ruined city of Palu.
"Every minute, quick help brings bodies.
Clean water is not enough."
Some people return to their ruined homes, take advantage of the incinerators, and try to save what they have found.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals damaged by an earthquake, with 7.5 bullets on the Richter scale, are overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Two Gerris with a fractured back and shoulder, rest near the building of the Pala’s army hospital, where patients are helped under the open sky by constant repeated movements.
His eyes filled with tears as he recalled how a strong espresso had broken down the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he stayed with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time for salvation.
It seems to me that I was stuck between the cracks of the wall," said Gerris to the Associated Press correspondent, adding that he and his family had come to the city for the wedding.
"I heard my wife ask for help, and then I wondered quietly.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "making psychological pressure" through "advertising advertising"
A week after the Chinese State newspaper posted on four pages of the American daily publication advertising material about the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday sent for the China Daily edition in the Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of trying to influence the elections to Congress on November 6th.
According to Reuters officials in the United States, Trump, in whom he accuses Beijing of attempting to interfere in the U.S. elections, means a new phase of escalation on the part of Washington, whose goal is to put pressure on China.
Although foreign governments may be able to place advertising for the activation of trade, an escalation of the trade war is taking place between Beijing and Washington in time, where they have already increased import duties.
According to experts from China and the United States, at the beginning of this war, the imposition of a repressive customs duty in China was intended to strike exporters from states such as Iowa, who supported the Republic of Trump.
Terry Brenstead, a U.S. ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa, China’s largest agricultural exporter, claimed that China had caused damage to American workers, farmers, and companies.
China, as Brenstead wrote in a column on the Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register, "is increasing pressure by publishing advertising in our independent press."
"To spread propaganda, the Chinese government is using the road for the American people's freedom of speech tradition and independence of the press, placing a pay ad in the Des Moines Register," wrote Brenstead.
"On the contrary, on the street schedules here in Beijing, you will find only the individual voices of different thoughts, and here you will not see a true picture of what the Chinese people are actually thinking about the direction of the Chinese economy, which is causing concern, which leads to the conclusion that the media in China is under the confident control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the major Chinese editions offered to publish" his article, but he didn't call it what it was.
Analysts warn that by a failure with the Kavano Republicans set up female voters against themselves before the interim elections
Since many well - known Republicans support and protect the candidate for the post of judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano after he has been charged with several charges of sexual harassment, analysts warn that this may lead to an unwanted reaction to future interim elections, especially in women.
Around this situation, there are passions, and the majority of the Republicans publicly say that they would like to go to the vote.
These things cannot then be played back," said Grant Riger, professor of political science at the University of Syracuse, during an interview.
Rigger expressed doubts that the FBI investigation, at which Senator Jeff Flake (Republic of Arizona) had recently come up, would be enough to calm the angry voters.
According to Washington, D.C., chief adviser and spokesman for the Progressional Group MoveOn (Continue) Catherine Jean-Perry said on Friday, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget about it either tomorrow or November."
According to Mic, on Friday morning, protestors sang "The Fall Is Coming!" during a demonstration at the Legal Committee, when the Republicans decided to move on to confirm Kavano's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
In an interview with St. Rottenberg's news website, an out-of-the-art political viewer, he said, "People will be extremely interested and motivated."
"They say it is now, and it is true.
However, motivation can be strengthened, especially in female voters 18-29 years of age with prejudices that have not yet been defined and often do not vote unless they like the president."
Before Ford gave a witness in connection with the charges against the High Court judge for sexual crime, analysts predicted the voter's negative reaction if Republicans insisted on confirmation.
According to NBC News, earlier this week's former head of the National Committee of the Republican Party Michael Steel said, "This is an unpleasant story for the Republican Party."
As stated in an interview with the news channel Director Priorities USA (priorities of the United States) (groups that assist in the pre-election campaign to the democrats) Gay Cecil, "the matter is not to vote in committee, the final vote, or that Kavano was on the bench of the defendants, but how they reacted to the situation and how they continued to act."
However, American thinking about whose testimony to believe, Ford or Kavano, has been divided, has a little bit more support for Ford.
According to a new survey by YouGov, 41% of respondents believe or believe ford's testimony, while Kavano believes or believes 35%.
In addition, 38% of those surveyed said that Kavano had given or would soon have given false testimony, while 30% of those surveyed said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, after Flake F.B.B.'s insistence, the charges filed by Ford and another caller, Deborah Ramirez, are being investigated.
Last week, Ford testified under oath to the Senate Legal Committee on how Kavano attacked her while in a state of alcohol abuse when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez stated that the candidate for the post of judge of the Supreme Court showed her her genitals at the party during their education at Else University in the 1980s.
An Internet designer plans to start a "new Internet" to create Google and Facebook competition
Team Berners-Lee, an inventor of the global Internet network, is launching a new startup to create Facebook, Amazon and Google competition.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is the development of an open-source Solid platform, which is owned by Bernards Lee.
With the Solid platform, users will be able to choose where to store the data and who to access it.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Bernards-Lei, the goal of Inrupt is "world domination".
"We must do it now," he said about the startup.
It's a historic moment."
The Solid technology is used to allow users to create a "personal online repository" or POD.
It may contain contact lists, current business lists, calendars, audio recordings library, and other tools for your own use and work.
It's like simultaneously using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify in a single browser.
The unique feature of this personal data repository is that it fully meets the needs of the user who can access any information.
The company calls it "increasing personal capabilities through data".
According to Director General Inrupt John Bruce, the company aims to use resources, processes and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Bernards Lee, Bruce, security platforms acquired in IBM, several state developers hired to work on the project, and volunteer software communities.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own autonomous applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Bernards-Lee said he and his team don't negotiate with Facebook and Google on whether to make a full replacement when all their business models undergo radical changes over a short period of time.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a Saturday's publication at Medium Berners-Le, he wrote that the Inrupt mission was "to provide commercial energy and the ecosystem and to help protect the integrity and quality of the new solid-based network."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet network, setting up the Consortium of the World Pavetin in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential figure in the debate on network neutrality.
Even at the launch of Inrupt Berners-Le, he remained the founder and director of the Consortium of the World Bank, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about the next era of network development," Bernards-Lei added.
Bernard Vann: Celebrating the Church of the Order of Christ Victoria in the years of World War I
The only representative of the Anglican Church who received the Order of "Christ Victoria" for participation in the war operations during World War I is honored in his home town 100 years later.
Colonel Bernard Vann received a reward for his participation in the attack under Belgian and Leocury on September 29, 1918.
However, he died four days later from the sniper’s bullet and never learned that he had received Britain’s highest military prize.
On Saturday, two of his grandsons discovered a memorial stone during a parade in the town of Rasden, in the county of Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, called the "extremely symbolic" that the discovery of the memorial stone took place 100 years after his grandfather made the promotion for which he received the reward.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann transferred his battalion through the St. Caten channel "through a very dense fog and under the blazing fire of field rifles and bullets."
Later, he rushed to the firefront and with "depressed courage" led a sharp forward, before which one broke into the field gun and destroyed three weapons of the enemy sub-division.
Colonel Vanna shot a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a little more than a month before the war ended.
72-year-old Michael Vann said that his grandfather did what he himself could never do and that he deserves respect.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, put the pot after the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very proud of taking part in this parade" and added that "the courage of a real hero shows him the respect that so many people show."
MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, but they were shown "Peppo Pig"
Imagine that you don't sleep all night just to watch the events filled with Bellator 206, and you're denied the opportunity to review the main event.
The posters of the tournament in San José included 13 battles, including six of the main programs that were broadcast live at night in the United Kingdom on the 5th channel.
At six o'clock in the morning, just before Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were ready to get together, TV viewers in the United Kingdom died of the sight when Peppa's lead appeared on the screen instead of the battle.
Some viewers were not pleased with this because they did not sleep until morning while waiting for the battle.
One of the fans wrote on Twitter that switching to a child's multimedia appeared to him "some sort of failed joke."
"According to the government's order, the content broadcast at 6 a.m. was inappropriate, so they were forced to release a child broadcast," said Dave Schwarz, senior vice president of marketing and communications with the public at Bellator, when asked about the broadcaster,
"Peppa Pig," yes.
Bellator Scott Koker, president of the company, promised to work on a broadcasting schedule to capture viewers in Britain in the future.
"I think that if we talk about repeating the broadcast, we'll be able to make it," said Kouker.
"But now there's Sunday, 6th morning, and we can't do anything until we have Sunday, and they have Monday.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when the broadcast was turned off, we found many of the messages we responded to, and the text of those messages was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical failure, and we tried to remove it.
However, it was found that this was a failure to comply with government regulations.
I can promise you that this will never happen again.
We're going to cut the tournament to five fights instead of six, as usual, and we're trying to redirect the signal to the fans, but we've been slowing down these attempts.
It's a really unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Dale felt worse for others because of his sexual orientation
Tom Dale's Olympic water stripper tells us that he grew up feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't understand that "not all look like him," until he went to high school.
Taking part in the Desert Island Discs broadcast on Radio 4, led by Lauren Lavern, he noted that he was openly expressing gay rights to give hope to others.
He also claimed that because of parenthood, he became less concerned with winning the Olympic Games.
The leader, Kirsty Young, who has been running this program for a long time, went to the hospital for several months.
When she came as a couple to Lavern's first show, Daley said she felt worse than others when she was a child, because "the community didn't take it when people liked boys and girls."
He said, "By this time, the feeling of inferiority and difference was what gave me strength and strength to achieve success."
According to him, he wanted to prove something "worthy," not to disappoint anyone who finally learned about his orientation.
A double bronze Olympic champion became a known fighter for the rights of the LBGT community and was used to appear at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was speaking openly about his views, because he felt happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and wanted to give this "hope" to others.
A three - time world champion admitted that his feelings toward the man, American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, had become a real surprise to him.
Daley married Oscar’s winner, who was 20 years older than him last year, but he said that the difference in age was never a problem.
"When you're going through so much in such a young age" (in the first Olympics he appeared at the age of 14, and after three years his father died of cancer), it's hard to find someone of his age who would also survive similar flights and falls.
In June there was a son in the marriage who was called Robert Ray Black-Dale, and since then, it's been said that he's changed his "worldly perception."
"If you asked me last year, I'd just think about what you should get the gold," he said.
"You know, there are things much more important than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father could not reconcile with the idea of the end, and before he died, he asked if they had bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him "you won't be in the first row because you won't be there anymore," said Daley.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and died, I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew it was what I had dreamed of all my life: to dive in front of my classmates at the Olympics, and there was no feeling better than that," said Daley.
This feeling also inspired him to choose his first song — Proud (Gordia) in the performance of Hizer Small — which he resonated with while preparing for the Olympic Games and still causes ants.
The Desert Island Discs program is released on BBC Radio 4 at 11.15 a.m. on Sunday.
On Saturday with a tournament match for "Cube Ryder" they took out Michelson, who wasn't in shape.
The American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th game in the tournament for "Cube Ryder", but he has to renew the form so that this event doesn't become unhappy for him.
Michelson, who took part in a two-year tournament on record 12th time, took Captain Jim Furick out of the game at the time of the Forbols and Forsams.
Instead of staying in the center of events, as he often did when playing for the United States, the five-time winner encouraged the team all day and practiced side by side, hoping to get emotional.
Since Michelson didn't make the right hits even at the top of his career, a 48-year-old sportsman didn't really fit in for the tough golf course of Le Golf National, where the rap is usually punishing for the erratic hits.
And if that's not the case, in the ninth match on Sunday, Michaelson will have to meet the Champion of the Open Championship and the Master of the Right Hit of Francesco Molinari, who won all his players this week in a match with the new Tommy Flitwood.
If the Americans who stay at three points after 12 singles start well, the Mikkelson match can be decisive.
Furick expressed confidence in his sportsman, and he certainly had nothing to add to it.
"To the end, he understood his role today, slapped me on my back, hugged me, and said he'd be ready tomorrow," said Furick.
"He has no doubt in his strength.
Michelson is a member of the Hall of Fame, who has done so much for the teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he was going to play two games.
I've been predicting more matches, but that's what happened, so we decided to do it.
He wants to be there, in the field, like anyone else."
If Mikelson comes out on Saturday, he'll win the Nick Faldo record, which played the greatest number of players in the Cup of Ryder.
At this point, he might finish his career at the Cup of Ryder tournament, which never met his individual achievement.
On account of Michelson’s 18 victories, 20 defeats, and 7 zero results, however, Furick said that his presence could play a decisive role for the team.
"He's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's funny," said Furick.
"I think the younger players were having a good time, riding on it, as well as this week, and it was interesting to observe it.
He's more than just a player."
Captain of the European team Thomas Byrne knows that the big split doesn't solve anything
Thomas Byron, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the delicate break in front of the solo players of the last day's tournament for "Cube Ryder" does not guarantee victory yet.
The Dutchman debuted in 1997 in the Walderram club field, where the team in the lead with his Ballesters aheaded the Americans at five points, but won the match with a slight split with the result of 141:131.2.
"You remember that we had a big match in the Valderram field; a big match in Brooklyn where we lost, and the Walderram field where we won the violence," said Byorn after reviewing the winning games Class 2018 with a result of 5:3 on Friday and yesterday at the Le Golf National Stadium, after which the match is 10.6.
So history teaches me and every player the command that nothing has yet been decided.
You have to play with the maximum payoff tomorrow.
Get out of the field and do whatever you need to do.
The game will end only after the result has been displayed on the board.
We have the goal of getting this trophy, and that's what we want.
As I said earlier, I focus on the 12 players of our team, but we are well aware of who opposes us -- the best players in the world."
Satisfied by the performance of his players in the complex field, Byrne added, "I will never run forward.
Tomorrow's gonna be different.
Tomorrow, individual matches are expected, and that's something else.
It's great playing field with your partner when everything goes well, but it's just when you're there alone, and you can check out what you're worth as a golfer.
Here's how to configure players to speak tomorrow: on the edge of the possibilities.
You're leaving your partner without support, and now he has to show you what he's capable of."
Unlike Byorna, the opposite number for Jim Furick is expected from his best game partners at the individual level, with the exception of Jordan Spyte and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
To Furick himself, the last day was turned by various sides: he was among the winners in Brooklyn, but he was defeated when the team from Europe created the "Miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he said in answer to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain of the 1999 team, organized players before the last day of the game.
"We've got 12 major players tomorrow, but we need to start successfully, like it was in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the initiative moves to someone else’s side, players in the middle of the distance face a special pressure.
We put the players in the team, as if we were going to, like, do something incredible tomorrow."
Thomas is assigned to try to lead the counterattack against Rory McCillroy, and then in the first half of the European team, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flettwood and Ian Poulter.
"Only these partners and in this order have I chosen because I want to share effort equally throughout the game," Bjorn commented on his selection of players in individual matches.
Entry into action of a new German warship was postponed again
Germany's most recent fleet of military and marine fleets were expected to be put into action in 2014 instead of the old Cold War War war courts, but local media reports suggest that this will not happen at least until next year because of inadequate systems and a sharp increase in expenditure.
According to Die Zeit, received from the military intelligence dictionary, the launch of the Rhineland-Pfaltz ship, the main vessel of the latest series of "Baden-Württemberg" frigates, was postponed until the first half of 2019.
This ship was to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery damaged the implementation of the ambitious project.
Four of the Baden-Württemberg-class ships, which military and marine knowledge ordered in 2007, are to replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
Understandably, they will be equipped with a powerful rifle, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as with some technologies to reduce visibility, such as radiolocation, infrared and acoustic.
Another important feature is a longer period of technical security. New frescoes are expected to be able not to return to the base port for about two years.
However, Die Zeit warns that due to constant delays, overtime military ships that were supposed to strengthen Germany’s military power at sea will also become obsolete at the time of entry into service.
The F125 multi-sacrifice frigate went into the headlines of the thoracic newspaper when the German naval forces officially refused to take the ship into action and returned it to the Blohm + Voss at Hamburg.
This is the first case of the return of the military ship to the shipyard after delivery.
The reasons for the return are unknown, but the German media have mentioned significant "software and equipment defects" that made the warship unfit for military operations.
The lack of software is of particular importance, as the Baden-Württemberg ship's crew is made up of about 120 sailors -- only half the number of soldiers serving on the old Bremen crew.
In addition, it has been found that the ship has a significant excess weight that is deteriorating its operational characteristics and limiting the possibilities for further modernization.
It's considered that the Rhineland-Pfaltz frigate is twice as heavy (7000 tons) as the ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the wrong equipment, another problem has become the total cost of the project, which also includes the cost of training the crew.
The estimated 2.2 billion euros have been converted into a staggering 3.1 billion euros (US$ 3.6 billion).
The problems of obtaining new frescoes were of particular importance in the light of recent warnings of the defeat of the German Navy forces.
In the early part of the year, the Armed Forces of the Bundestag, Hans-Peter Bartels, reported that the WMS of the country had "almost ships fit for fighting".
The officer claimed that the situation had deteriorated sharply over a period of time, since the old vessels had been out of operation and the new ones had not arrived.
He expressed his deep regret at the fact that none of the Baden-Württemberg crews could fill the military-marriage fleet.
A National Trust to Observe the Secret Life of the Bats
A new survey carried out in the landscaping area of the Scottish Mountains is designed to establish how bats use landscapes in search of food.
Scientists hope that the data received will help to shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals in order to take action to preserve them in the future.
In the Inver in West Rossi Gardens, scientists of Scotland's National Trust will observe species such as bats and pygmies, as well as ears of normal and watery nightgown.
Special registrants will be placed in strategic locations in the landscaping area to observe the behavior of bats during the season.
Workers and volunteers of the National Trust of Scotland will also conduct mobile surveys using manual detectors.
An expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to determine the frequency and frequency of bat screams.
Then it's planned to develop a detailed map of the animals' habitat and prepare a report to link animal behavior to their habitat.
Rob Deuar, an adviser to nature conservation in the National Trust of Scotland, is expected to help determine which areas of life are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to assess the effectiveness of environmental management interventions (e.g. human formation) and identify best forest conservation methods for bats and other species associated with them.
During the last century, the population of bats has declined significantly in Scotland and in Britain.
They are threatened by the active construction and conquest of areas that deprive them of their nesting site.
Other negative factors include wind installations and lighting, fly glue paper, chemical processing of building materials, as well as home shell attacks.
They're not really blind.
However, nighttime hunting makes their ears more effective than their eyes.
They use a complex echolocation method to detect insects and obstacles to flight routes.
In Scotland’s National Trust, which oversees more than 270 historic buildings, 38 special gardens, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land throughout the country, the problem of bats is very serious.
Ten specialized experts regularly carry out research, examinations of nesting sites, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization's efforts have even created the first and only bats' reservoir in Scotland, and it's located in the territory of Triv in the Damfris-and-Hallow area, where eight of the ten bats live in Scotland.
David Thompson, the head of the premises, claims to be the perfect place for them.
"There are three wonderful conditions for bats in the territory," he assures.
"There are old buildings, many giant trees and other favorable living conditions.
But we still need to learn a lot about bats, and with the research we're doing here and elsewhere, we'll be able to learn more about what they need to thrive."
He insists that it is very important to check the territory for bats before any technical work is done, because by accidental destruction of one nesting place for the young can kill up to 400 females with babies, which is likely to cause the destruction of the entire local population.
The dogs and their nests are protected by law, and animals are forbidden to kill, torture, or trouble.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish Sagittarius Conservation Center, called on the public to join the efforts of the organization.
She said, "We still need a lot to know about our bats, and we haven't yet discovered the characteristics of the populations of many species."
Ronaldo rejects charges of rape, and his lawyers prepare calls against the German edition
Cristian Ronald called the charges of rape "an insult" and said that people "try to draw attention to themselves," using his name.
His lawyers are ready to call against the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published suspect information.
The American Catherine Mayorg accused the foreword of collective Portugal and the Juventus Football Club in a 2009 rape in a good number in Las Vegas.
As Der Spiegel reported on Friday, Ronald seemed to pay her $375,000 for silence.
A few hours after the charges were filed, 33-year-old Ronald turned to 142 million of his honoraries in the Instagram videocast, calling them "a joke".
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today's accusations are slander," said a five-time gold ball commander.
"They want to draw attention to themselves, using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to take advantage of me, but similar situations are part of my work.
I'm a happy man and I'm all right," added a footballer, laughing.
According to the Reuters Information Agency, Ronald's lawyers are preparing an appeal against Der Spiegel for the published charges that they have called "an unacceptable message of suspicion in the sphere of private life".
Advocate Christian Schertz stated that a football player would claim compensation for "moral damage in proportion to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious cases of personal rights violations in recent years."
The incident reportedly occurred in June 2009 at the hotel number Palms Casino in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after meeting at the nightclub, Ronald and Majorg returned to the number of the player who allegedly raped her. Such testimony was handed down to the district court in Clarke, Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the incident described by Ronaldo, he fell on his knees and said that he was a 99-percent good guy, who said "one-percent."
As noted in the papers, Ronald confirmed that he had sex with the model, but after a mutual agreement.
Majorga also claims that she turned to the police and then to the hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later she agreed to the conviction because she was afraid of revenge and warned of "public humiliation".
Now a 34-year-old woman wants to cancel her previous contract because she continues to suffer because of an incident that she says took place.
At the time of Ronald's incident, he was preparing to move to the Real Madrid FK from Manchester United FK, which this summer he became a major player of the Italian football team, the Youth team, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain will "permanently be sorry" for the loss of car manufacturers
Great Britain will "permanently be sorry" if it loses the status of world leader in the automotive industry after Brexit, which is warned by the Minister of Economy Greg Clark.
He added that he was welcomed by the statement of representatives of Toyota UK, who reported to BBC journalists that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, the company would have to suspend its production and work in Bernaton, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Minister Clark.
The Japanese auto manufacturer claimed that the consequences of delays in the cordon in Brexit can cost jobs without a contract.
The factory in Bern, where Toyota models of Auris and Avensis are manufactured, released about 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the countries of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will be stopped," said Marvin Cook, Director General Toyota in Bernston.
Other car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about how Britain will exit the EU without an international trade agreement.
For example, BMW stated that the factory in Oxford would be closed in a month after Brexit.
The main fears of car manufacturers are that Brexit can cause no contract risks to supply chains.
The Toyota line is operating in the mode of delivery of the details and materials as needed, and the details come every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for car manufacturers.
If on March 29, Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, there may be a break in the supply of details that will lead to delays and lack of material.
As noted in the company, Toyota has no more than one day to place the details, so the production has to stop.
Greg Clark noted that in the EU's relations plan prepared by the Chequers Plan, "an individual plan to avoid problems on the cordon is envisaged."
"We need a deal, we need an optimal deal, which I think will enable us not only to achieve success at the moment, but also to take advantage of the prospects that have arisen," he said during Today's program at BBC Radio 4.
"In view of the testimony of Toyota's representatives and other car manufacturers, we need to maintain high-performance supply chains."
Toyota was unable to tell how long production will be stopped, but in the long term, it is expected that increased costs will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and, as a result, reduce jobs.
Peter Cuvalaris, head of the unit's trade union board at the Bernaton plant, who worked here for 24 years, said that other participants were extremely concerned: "I can tell from experience that the jobs are not being restored."
The government's representative said, "We have put forward a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
The meeting of Trump and Rosenstein can be postponed again, noted in the White House
As representatives of the White House reported on Sunday, the responsible meeting of Donald Trump, with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, could be "laying down for a week" as long as discussions continue to lead to Brett Kavano's candidacy for the post of judge of the Supreme Court.
Rosenstein controls the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia's involvement in the elections, links between Tramp's assistants and Russia's potential interference with the President's justice.
For a few months in Washington, D.C., there is a discussion of the likelihood of a deputy prosecutor’s release that would endanger Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had expressed concern about the use of microphones for recording talks with Trump and the possibility of extending the President's term of office, as amended by Amendment 25.
Rosenstein didn't confirm that.
But last Monday he visited the White House on the ground reports that the officer was going to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump claimed that "I wouldn't want" to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a coincidence in time with the Senate Legal Committee, on which to give testimony to Kavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
On Friday, Trump was scheduled to conduct a weekly FBI investigation into charges against Kavano, which further suspended the Senate vote.
Tramp's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, performed at the Fox News Sunday TV show.
She said to the question about meeting with Rosenstein, "The date of the meeting is not scheduled, and maybe it's going to happen this week, and I expect it to be postponed for another week, given all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, I keep an eye on the news."
Some journalists did not agree with this: Sanders did not give a briefing to the media in the White House on September 10.
Chief Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the frequent briefings were not related to the unwarranted play on the part of television reporters, although she added, "I won't deny what they're playing on the audience."
Then she assumed that Trump himself would communicate with the press more.
"The president answers questions more often than any president," she added, without referring to the source: "Statistics are talking about themselves."
Sanders said the briefings would still take place, but "if there's a chance in the press to ask the President of the United States, it's better than talking to me."
We've been trying to communicate often with the press, and this should be particularly noticeable over the past few weeks, and the ability to talk to the president of the United States is not worse than the press conference."
The Trump regularly answers questions when taking action outside the White House, open meetings or press conferences for the participation of high-ranking guests.
Press conferences are rarely held.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why it is so, in the presence of journalists, it is strange and sometimes strange.
Secretary of State for the Protection of Scotland's Health addressed workers from the EU in connection with Brexit fears
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the citizens of other EU countries working in the National Health Service of Scotland to express their gratitude for their work and to ask for its continuation after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The government of Scotland has already assumed its obligation to cover the costs of applying for permanent residency status for EU citizens working in autonomous state services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman said: "The negotiations between the UK and the EU on the issue of exit took place during the summer, and we have to wait for the appropriate decisions in this fall.
But the British government is making preparations for a possible solution without a contract.
I know that this period can be very worrying for you.
That is why I would like to stress again how I appreciate the contribution of every employee regardless of nationality.
Friends from all over the European Union and countries outside the European Union share valuable experience and skills, strengthening and improving the health services for the benefit of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we want you to stay."
Cristion Ebercrombie underwent a terminal surgery after head trauma
The deputy headmaster of the Tennessee State Tigers team, Cristion Ebercrombie, transferred a term-of-term operation after he was injured in a Sunday match against the Vanderbilt Comodores, whose team lost at 31:27.
The chief coach of the Tennessee State Tigers team told reporters that the player was injured shortly before the break.
"He came to the sideline where he had become ill," said Reed.
On the side line, the coaches and medical personnel gave Ebercrombie oxygen before carrying it for further examination.
The official representative of the Tennessee State Tigers team reported to Chris Harris from the WSMV channel, Nashville, Tennessee, that Ebercrombie operated at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "while there's no evidence of the type and severity of the trauma," the Tennessee State Tigers team is trying to find out when the player got the trauma.
Ebercrombie, a secondary student, spent his first season at Tennessee State Tigers after leaving Illinois.
He did five grabs on Sunday before he got out of the game.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher government fee if they acquire real estate in Britain
Foreign buyers will pay more money if they buy real estate in Britain.
This approach neutralizes all Corbin's attempts to join young voters
A higher government fee will come from those who don't pay taxes in Britain
The Ministry of Finance expects an additional 120 million pounds a year to help homeless people.
As Theresa May today announced, foreigners who buy real estate in Britain will pay more fees, and additional expenses will be spent on helping the homeless.
This step can be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's efforts to involve young voters with the promise of a more accessible housing for highly paid workers.
The increase in customs will apply to natural and legal persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
An additional fee, accompanied by a two - year increase in property and property for rent, may amount to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance is expected to add £120 million a year.
According to experts, 13% of the new real estate that is built in London is owned by foreign citizens, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult for those who only dream of their own home.
Many rich areas of the country, including the capital, are deserted, since a large number of foreign buyers spend most of their time abroad.
The new action plan came up only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the state fee to make housing more accessible to young people.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high prices for immovable property by building the land without any further use.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of important reforms in the area of real estate, including the control of rent and the impossibility of eviction without sound grounds.
He also proposes to extend the authority of local councils in the field of construction of a new residence.
Teresa May said: "I promised that I would devote my prime minister to restoring the British dream -- for every new generation of life, it must be better.
This calls for changes in our imperfect home market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build their future here.
However, it is not fair to say that individuals who do not live in Britain and foreign companies buy housing under the same conditions as British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own home has become inaccessible, and the problem of living under the open sky remains very painful."
Jack Ross: "All I want to be the chief coach of Scotland."
F.C. Sanderland's Chief Coach Jack Ross says he's more than anything that he ever wants to take the lead in Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scottish took the initiative to restore the club from the north-east of the country, which now has a third place in the First Football League, to three points away from the leader.
Ross moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, returning the last season of the St. Mirren F.C. to Scotland's Premier League.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got to the second assembly in Scotland, but it's over," Ross told me during the sportssound program at BBC Scotland radio station.
"When I was a kid, my father and I often watched the game of collective Scotland at the Hampden Park stadium.
The only hope for me is to be a successful head coach at the club."
Rossa's predecessors at the Sanderland FC, among other things, were Dick Advocate, David Moies, Sam Ellardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gustavo Poet and Paolo De Canio.
Former FK chief of staff, Alloa Atletik, says he didn't feel any excitement about going to the big club after such authoritative names, previously rejecting the proposals from FK Barnes and Ipswich Town.
"At this stage, I'll think that I've achieved success if the club goes back to the Premier League.
Thanks to its structure and its technical security, this club is undoubtedly in line with the level of the Prime League," he noted.
"It's going to be a difficult task, but another result I can't think of as a success."
Ross is only three years old to build a coaching career, and before that he worked as a second coach at the Dambarton FC, and spent 15 months at the Garts FC.
Then he helped Alloa grow after the F.C. got to the third division, and the next season with Saint Mirren went the way from the flight stage to the title of the first division winners.
According to Ross, he now feels more comfortable than ever during his gaming career at the Clyde F.C., Hartulpool, Folkerk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"I'm on a break," he says, talking about the move to the Hello F.C.
"I sincerely believed that coaching was more suitable for me than playing.
That sounds strange because I was successful, and I made good on it, and I reached certain heights.
But it's very hard to play.
There are many challenges that have to be overcome each week.
I'm still dealing with them, stress and stress, but as a major coach, I feel at home.
I've always been interested in coaching, and I've never felt so comfortable with my adult life since I chose this profession."

Study: 17:30 Sunday is the perfect time for a beer bowl
Summer heat has helped to increase the pressure of British pubs that are not in the best weather, but has increased the pressure on the network of restaurants.
According to the calculations, sales in cotton and bars in July increased by 2.7%, while the revenues of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
The author of Peter Martin of the CGA's consultation on business development said, "Thanks to the sun's weather and longer duration than expected, England's participation in the World Championship passed the same schedule in July as in the previous month, when the dropout rate grew by 2.8%, and so things went even worse in restaurants.
June fell by 1.8% in July.
The pubs and bars focused on the supply of drinks, while they have the best performances — increasing their profits as well as the loss of restaurants.
Dads who are fed also suffered from heat, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that guests are interested only in drinking.
In the sub-controlled pubs and bars, drinks increased by 6.6% per month, while food sales decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst at the Department of Free and Good Business in RSM, noted: "The trends we've seen since the end of April.
Weather and extensive social or sporting events remain the main factors that affect sales in the internal market.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to lose profits. The annual drop in sales by 4.8% is causing special concern about the need to cut costs.
The long hot summer did not come at the best time for the food-supply bets, and we'll see if we can give them a more moderate temperature that we've seen in August."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new buildings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the market for new brands.
A gallus indicator of the volume of sales of Coffer Peach Tracker in the British pubs, bars and restaurants sector is a picture of the total turnover of 47 working groups, with a total turnover of over £9 billion.
Every fifth child has a parent account on the social network.
As research has shown, every fifth child, sometimes under the age of 11, has a social network account hidden from parents and teachers.
A study involving 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fictitious pages in Instagram
This news raised concerns about the possible placement of sexual content
20% of students reported having a "main account" showing their parents
Every fifth child, sometimes under the age of 11, creates an account on social networks that hides from adults.
A study involving 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fictional pages in Instagram — a social network for the exchange of photographs.
This news raised concerns about the possible placement of sexual content.
20% of students reported having a clean "main" account that shows parents and one or more private ones.
The mother who happened to come across her 13-year-old daughter's secret page saw the call to rape me.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in private schools showed that 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles in social networks.
HMC head Mike Bukenen said, "We are very concerned that many teenagers are eager to create an online space where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Alyid Doyle will be "a representative of the interests of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Council.
Alyid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as an independent director during the annual board of directors.
Doyle, Scotland’s most popular lightball player, has been calling this step an excellent opportunity for those taking the lead in sports to take advantage of its extensive international experience during the last decade.
"Eilid is used with great respect among athletes in Scotland, Britain and the world, and we are convinced that if he joins it, sports in Scotland will be of great benefit," said Beatty.
Doyle said, "I'm inspired by the role of an athlete's representative, and I hope that I can really benefit and promote sports in Scotland."
The American, a four - time Olympic champion who won a race of 200 and 400 feet [200 and 400 m] in the 1996 Atlantic Games, and now a BBC sportsman, lost the opportunity to go through a transient ischaemic attack.
He wrote in Twitter, "A month ago I had an stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that it would only be time to show me whether I could recover and how much.
Thanks to the incredible effort, I was able to recover completely, and I have learned to walk again, and I am doing dynamic exercises today!
Thank you for your support!"
Women's milk cleaners were compared to cows. Internet users' ideas were divided.
The manufacturer of milk-smokers faced a unique reaction from Internet users to advertising where young mothers are compared to active cows.
To mark the release of a product called "the world's first silent sodium vacuum cleaner", Elvie's technology company has launched a humorous music video advertising to demonstrate the freedom that a new vacuum cleaner provides for mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a blue cobbler with the words, "Yes, I feed myself, but I don't have the tail" and "As you see myself, it's not the tail, it's my chest."
The chorus goes on to say, "Smooth, suck to feed the children. Smooth, suck to keep the milk from empty."
However, the advertising role, published on Facebook’s website, has sparked a heated online discussion.
The video has received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, but the reaction of Internet users has been mixed up. Many have noted that the advertising has not appreciated the "horrible organization" of milk production in the industry.
"It's not a very wise decision to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to give milk, but their children are being taken in by them a few days after birth," wrote one user.
Elvie can easily be hidden in the b butthole for food (Elvie/Mother)
Here's another comment: "It's understandable that it's traumatic for both mother and child.
But why don't you join them for the milk-smoker advertisements for women who need to feed their babies?"
Someone else added, "This commercial is very far from reality."
Other users have been defending the advertising role, and one of the women's videos was "very fun".
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
She would certainly have obtained such a thing if she were still breast - feeding.
I really felt like a cow when I sucked the milk.
Advertising is crazy, but I didn’t look for hidden meaning in it.
Great product," someone wrote.
Here's another comment: "A piece of ad directed at a mother who sucks milk (usually at work or in a toilet) and feels cows.
This advertising is not aimed at clarifying the advantages and disadvantages of the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women demonstrate the milky smokers hidden in their pockets.
The concept of advertising campaign is based on information that many women who use similar products feel cows.
However, Elvie's vacuum cleaner works very quietly, has no wires or tubes, and is easily hidden in the food bustal, which allows women to move freely, keep their children and even walk out the street.
Anna Balarin, partner and executive creative director of the advertising agency Mother, commented: "Elvie's vacuum cleaner is so revolutionary that he demanded a clear and provocative presentation.
After passing a parallel between women who are milking milk and real cows, we wanted to pay attention to the characteristics of breast-feeding, in a fascinating and interesting way by demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that a new smoker will bring.
Elvie's smoker doesn't get into the news headlines for the first time.
Within the London Week of Fashion, the mother of two children appeared on the floor with this product when she showed the clothes from the model Martti Jacobovski.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to the tent town on the Czech border
The number of detained migrant children has increased sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, especially because the harsh rhetoric and politics of the Tramp administration have made it difficult to place children in care centers.
Traditionally, in most cases, caregivers have made their own statements without documents, and now they are afraid of endangering their own ability to stay in the country by offering to take responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would be obliged to print their fingers and that these data would be transmitted to immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Albens, the senior immigration and customs officer of the Bureau, testified before the Congress that the Bureau’s employees had arrested dozens of people who applied for care for minors without a escort.
Later, the Bureau confirmed that 70% of those arrested did not have a criminal record.
"Approximately 80% of those who are caregivers or members of their households are illegally staying in the country, many of them foreigners who have committed a crime.
That's why we continue to pursue these people," said Mr. Albens.
According to the shelter workers, in order to deal more quickly with children's issues, officials have introduced new rules that would require some of the children to appear before the court within a month after detention, not 60 days as before.
Many of them will be able to use videoconferencing and not come to court personally to prove their legal status before immigration judges.
Those who do not have the right to take refuge will be quickly deported.
According to shelter workers and official data from responsible officials over the past few months, the longer the children remain under guard, the more likely they will be to feel anxiety or depression, which can lead to panics of violence or attempts to escape.
Travelers claim that these problems are increasing in institutions of greater size, such as Tornillo, where it is more difficult to monitor children’s psychological condition.
They added that by moving children to the tent and not giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say good - bye to their friends, we are at risk of exacerbating the trauma that many of them have already experienced.
Syria ordered the U.S. occupying forces, France and Turkey to immediately expel the army
In addition, speaking before the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister, Valid Al-Mualem, called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country had already experienced war for the eighth year.
Mualam, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian land under the control of combating terrorism, so "adherence to them will be appropriate."
"They have to go immediately and not make the conditions," he said at the assembly.
Mualam insisted that "the war against terrorism has actually ended" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said Damascus will continue "this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has deployed some 2,000 military personnel in Syria, mainly teaching and consulting Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs, who speak against President Bashar al-Assad.
In a war - torn country, France sent over 1,000 soldiers.
As for the refugees, Mualem made sure that the country had the right conditions for their return, and he also accused "some Western countries" of "spreading unwarranted fears," which prevented refugees from returning.
"We have called for an international community and humanitarian organizations to help people return," he said.
"We're watching an effort to politicalize the humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not provide assistance in restoring the country until a political agreement has been concluded between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats report that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone around Idlib, the last major insurgent, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey Treaty has prevented the massive rise of the Syrian forces supported by Russia from entering the province of three million people.
However, Mualem stressed that the treaty had "clear terms", and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including Al-Qaeda-related fighters of the An-Nusra Front, who would "be destroyed."
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura expects to convene the first meeting of a new committee to be formed by government and opposition representatives to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and create conditions for elections.
Mualam set out conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that his work should be limited to "a review of the actual constitution" and warned against interference.
Why the Trampa Will Be Redesigned
According to this logic, Trump can be converted into 2020 if, as many liberal viewers are likely to expect, he does not have authority until after the scandal and implication.
Without a doubt, this would be "the most dramatic endings of the presidency all the time"!
At the moment, the viewers do not give a hint of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in the prime time has more than doubled (up to 1.05 million) on the CNN channel and has actually tripled (up to 1.6 million) on the MSNBC channel.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show on the MSNBC cable channel was at the top of the rating of 3.5 million viewers in the evening when the main news is being discussed.
"It's a fire that attracts people, because it's beyond our understanding," said Neil Ber, an executive drama producer at the ABC channel on the state secretary who becomes president after a destructive attack on Capitol.
Nell Skovell, an experienced humorist writer and author of the book "Just funny moments: and a few hard truths about entering the Hollywood Men's Club" offers another theory.
She recalled her trip to the Boston taxi before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that she would vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because he's making me laugh," he said.
Chaos is thinking.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, Washington's stories are capable of identifying the future of Row versus Wade, the possibility of bringing together immigrant families and the state of the world economy.
Disturbing is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet you can't say that you're just trying to stay informed by citizens when you're watching for six hours as a group of experts discuss using Bob Woodward's "well-informed" sources for his book "The Fear," Paul Manafort's jacket from the skin of the Strauss for $15,000 -- "The Clothing for the Entrepreneurs" -- as written in The Washington Post) and the shocking anatomy descriptions of Mr. Trump, published by Storm Daniels.
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be before.
"The reality of the show is partly related to what is happening to you every evening," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the Star of the Lambard television program, about the rotations in the actor's office and the day-to-day contemporary rotations in the "Tramp" show (a conflict with NFL, support Kim Chen In).
If you allow yourself to miss a single episode, you can leave hopelessly.
When this week I was able to meet Mr. Fles in his house on the northern coast of the island of Kauai, there was a warm sun (27 degrees Celsius), but he was sitting at home looking at MSNBC and recording CNN.
He could not break free from television — not when Brett Cavano was before the Senate Legal Committee, but when the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
"I remember how we created all those crazy shows of our time, and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fles told me.
"I took it as a joke, but they seemed to be right."

Extraordinary Costs in the Hardest Intermediate Elections at Congress
It is no wonder that in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, there are additional money influxes, because two actual congressmen are competing for one chair by viewing the electoral districts.
In the fight for this suburban district of Pittsburgh, whose borders have recently been changed, democracy enters, a member of the House of Representatives of Connor Lemb, who won the victory in another district in the additional elections last spring.
Lemb is opposed to another effective congressman, the Republic of Kitt Rotfs, who is now representing the 12th district of Pennsylvania, whose borders are significantly similar to the new 17th.
The maps were redesigned after the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January that the old boundaries of the areas were designated for the benefit of the Republics against the Constitution.
The pre-election competitions in the new 17th district sparked fierce opposition between the financial sub-divisions of the main parties, the Committee of the United States Democratic Party of Congress (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Party (NRCC).
Lemba's name became very well known in Pennsylvania after a victory with a minimum advantage in the 18th district during the additional elections at Congress in March, which were used by the general public.
President Donald Trump won a 20-point victory in this district.
Political experts have given little priority to democracy.
In the United States, El Salvador was considered punishable by China, but changed its mind
The diplomats recalled the weak resistance of Washington to the action of the Dominican Republic and the Panamans, who had previously supported Beijing.
In June 2017, Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela. Before, Trump also had a hotel in Panama until the partners removed the staff hired by Trump Organisation.
Officials of the State Department decided to withdraw the heads of the U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions on non-recognition of Taiwan," said Heser Noyert's Secretary of State at the beginning of this month.
But sanctions were only being addressed against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in US aid in 2017, particularly in the field of drug control, as well as in support of social and economic development.
The proposed fines, which provided for cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for this country in Central America with its high level of unemployment and homicide.
As a result of the internal councils of the North American and Central American states, the conference was held at a high level, dedicated to security and economic prosperity.
But by mid-September, senior officials of the administration had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, and in fact, the question of sanctions against El Salvador had stopped.
According to the diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pens is now planning to attend a conference to be held in mid-October, as a sign that the administration considers this action very important.
The three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic because there were no new harsh reports or punishments from Washington.
Mr. Bolton’s representative in the White House refused to comment on the details of the internal discussions reported by three U.S. officials, two of whom were diplomats, under the terms of anonymity.
The information they provided was confirmed by a side analytic, close to the administration, which also spoke in terms of anonymity.

History’s movements are defined at such crucial points, and the immeasurable movement of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are now waiting for a few such breakthroughs.
What will we do if Trump is released from office of Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the person upon whom Mr. Mueller's ruling depends?
Rosenstein was still in the halope as the newspaper revealed information that while he was secretly offering to record talks with the president and to share his views on the failure of Trump to comply with the position.
Rosenstein called the information in The Times inaccurate.
"How do we react if investigations into Brett Kavano's case, which the FBI has recently launched, prove to be insufficiently thorough or honest or if Kavano's candidacy for a position in the Supreme Court is confirmed, despite convincing allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?

Grem Dorrans of Rangers with optimism awaits a meeting with the Vienna Rapid.
The Rangers F.C. is accepting Rapid (Viden) on Thursday, and after an impressive no-one in Spain in the game of Villareal at the beginning of this month's victory over the Austrians, the Scottish Club will have a good chance to get out of the G League of Europe.
Because of the trauma, the knee of the defender, Grem Dorrans, was able to play for the first time in the season for his team only in the game with the "Villareal", which ended with the account at 2:2. But he thinks the FK "Randers" can use this result as a trampline to achieve greater.
"It was a good result for us, because "Vilarreal" is a strong team," said a 31-year-old player.
"We went out in the game hoping to get a point and got one point.
At the end of the match, we might be able to move forward, but in general, nobody can be considered a fair outcome.
In the first team, the opponent was better, but after the break, we corrected the situation for our benefit.
There will be another major opposition in the League of Europe on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it's not easy, and our future competitors have shown a good result in their last game, but we can count on the support of the infighters, and I'm sure we can win a fight and get a positive result.
Last year, of course, it was difficult, starting with my trauma and ending the changes at the club itself, but now the situation has been normalizing.
We have a great store, and all the boys are happy.
I hope we can move on, leave behind the last season and achieve success."
Women lose sleep because of fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to organize care for themselves, few talked about it with their family members.
Nearly half of the people involved in the nationwide survey said they were talking to their husband or wife about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10% of the respondents talked about it with the children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but don't rush into talking about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide branch on life insurance.
That's what we need to start with.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: your family cannot provide you with the necessary care if you do not report your wishes to your parents in advance.
Ask your consultant and family to determine where and how to get care, because this choice can be an important factor when determining cost.
Make an appointment with the financial advisor: He can advise you on how to cover the expenses.
The sources of long-term care finance include traditional insurance policy, hybrid life insurance policy or self-sustainment on your own (subject to money).
Carefully prepare legal documents: this will enable you to avoid legal harassment in advance.
Prepare confidence for your representative, who will monitor your medical care and monitor your wishes if you are unable to do so on your own.
In addition, we recommend that we develop confidence in the availability of money.
Choose a trusted person who will make a financial decision for you and pay your bills if you are incapacitated.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, reports government officials, but the number of victims may increase.
Because of the way out of the system of liaison officers dealing with humanitarian assistance, they can't get any information from Dongal's regency, an area north of Pala, which is closer to the earthquake epidemic of 7.5-balls.
After the disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Pala.
Let us consider some basic facts about the island of Sulaves, the city of Palu, and Dongal’s regency.
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of 379,800, according to the 2017 data.
When the tsunami struck, the city celebrated its 40th birthday.
Dongala is a regency that extends more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) along the coastline on the northwest coast of the island of Sulawesi.
According to 2017 data, about 299,200 people live in the administrative region of the lower part of the province.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic sectors of the province of Central Solawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongal.
The production of nickel is also important in the province, but mainly concentrated in Moroval, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to data from the Indonesian disaster relief agency, Pala and Dongal have suffered several times from tsunamis over the past 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people died as a result of tsunamis in Dongala, and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
In 1996, the tsunami also covered the western part of Dongal, and nine men died.
Indonesia is located in a seismicly active Pacific fire ring and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
The following are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: On December 26, a severe earthquake on the West Coast of the Indonesian province of Acheg, located in northern Sumatra, triggered tsunamis that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Acheg.
2005: At the end of March, a series of powerful earthquakes broke out on the western coast of Sumatra in early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The 6.8.Ball earthquake struck the southernmost island of Java, Indonesia, and triggered tsunamis that hit the southern coast, resulting in the death of some 700 people.
2009: Near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra, an earthquake of 7.6 pounds [7.6 kg].
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: The 7.5 - inch - high [7.5 - b] earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentavai, located near Sumatra, and caused tsunamis to rise to about 300 feet [10 m], resulting in the destruction of tens of thousands and the death of some 300 people.
2016: The weak earthquake hit the Regent of the Asceg Province, causing destruction and panic related to the fact that people have not yet forgotten the devastating earthquake and tsunamis in 2004.
This time there were no tsunamis, but more than 100 people died under the cracks of buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, resulting in more than 500 deaths, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed countless homes, and thousands of tourists could not leave the island immediately.
The oldest son of Sarah Palin was arrested for domestic violence.
Treka Peylin, the eldest son of former Governor Alaska and the candidate for Vice President Sara Peylin, were arrested for charge of assault.
According to a report published on Saturday by the Alaska State Police, 29-year-old Peylin from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence and charged with obstructing reports of violence and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when a well - known woman tried to call the police to report possible crimes, he picked up her phone.
According to KTUU, Pailin is being held in custody in the Matanuska-Susitnan insulator, with the right to pay $500.
He's put before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent," when he was asked if he confessed to his guilt, they reported on the network.
Peline is accused of three Class A offenses, which include a one - year term arrest and a fine of $250,000.
He's also charged with class B offences, which is punishable by a $2,000 prison day and fine.
It's not the first time Peylin's been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Peline.
His mother, Sarah Payline, called the police and reported a possible attack.
The case is now before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, as well as with preventing reports of domestic violence and carrying weapons in a state of alcohol abuse when the incident occurred.
His girlfriend said he hit her face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticizing groups of veterans for justifying her son’s harsh conduct with posttraumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq.
In Indonesia, the tsunami caused hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died after an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 - ball earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed hundreds of homes.
The networks of communications and power supply are out of power, and the number of victims can increase in the next few days.
The earthquake became close to the center of the island of Sulawesi, in the northeastern part of the capital of Jakarta, Indonesia.
A video that spreads on social networks is shown when the natural world hits.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival on the beach of Palu when tsunamis hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist in New York City
In New York, federal prosecutors demand the death penalty of Syfullo Saipov, a suspected terrorist in New York, resulting in the death of eight persons — a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov, a driver hired at Home Depot, went on a bicycle road along the road to West Side, Lower Manhattan, and started to hit the bikers and pedestrians that were on his way.
According to the report of the intention to claim the death of eight people in the Southern District of New York to justify the death penalty, the accused must prove that Saipo "intendedly" killed eight people and "intendedly" caused serious bodily damage.
According to court documents, each of these charges provides for the possibility of a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal jurors court filed a 22-point Saip charge, including eight charges of murder for demanding that federal prosecutors usually prosecute in cases involving organised crime, as well as charges of violence and destruction of road transport.
According to the prosecutors who described Saipa's crime as "horrible, cruel and vicious", this attack is the result of "reverent planning and pre-thinking".
Victims of Syfulla Habibullaevich Saipov's injuries, injuries or killings became Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Anna Laura Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Ferruki, Ernan Diego Mendos, and Alejandro Damian Pagnukko, as described in the intent report.
Five dead were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last criminal case of death was committed in South New York City.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers and eventually sentenced to eternal imprisonment in September 2009.
For the last time, the death penalty for the federal case was carried out in New York in 1953. Julius and Etel Rosenbergev were executed after being convicted of espionage for the benefit of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
On June 19, 1953, both Rosenberg died in an electric chair.
According to Saipov’s court case, Uzbekistan’s native, did not show remorse in the following days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he said to the investigator that it is not a pity for the wounded.
According to Saipov’s indictment, he informed the authorities that he had been inspired by the IDIL video attack he was watching on his phone.
The police reported that he had also requested that the IDIL flag be suspended in his hospital ward.
He did not blame himself for the 22nd plea.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sayipova, said they were "very disappointed" by such a decision of the prosecutor's office.
"We believe that the decision to obtain a death penalty instead of admitting guilt and condemning eternal imprisonment without release will only strengthen the psychological trauma caused by these events for all the victims," Patton said.
Saipov’s defense party had previously also asked the prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
Parliament's MP from the Conservative Party believes that NIJEL FARAJA must be appointed responsible for Brexit's negotiations
Today, while protesting for a conservative party, Nigel Faraj promised to mobilize the people's army.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party stated that politicians should "taste pressure" on European skeptics, as one of the MEPs in Teresa May offered her candidacy for negotiations with the EU.
A member of the Conservative Party, Peter Bown, said on the march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have "extended" if Mr. Faraj was Brexit's secretary.
Considering the problems met by May, in an effort to reconcile their deep-seated ranks, the fact that members of the Conservative Party who are against the exit joined a special protest in the city against Brexit was even more appealing.
The prime minister of forces is trying to bring in the Compromise Plan of Chequers, despite attacks by Brexit supporters, those against exit, and the EU.
The Allies insist that it will not leave an attempt to deal with Brussels, despite a negative reaction, and will force Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between what it proposes and chaos.
At the Leave Means Leave in Solihaly, Mr. Bowen said he wanted to "refuse the Chequers".
He invited Mr. Faraju to come out of the shadows and take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible for this, we'd be out," he said.
Members of Parliament Wellingboro added, "I will support Brexit, but we must give up the Chequers."
Speaking against the EU, he said: "We have been fighting in world wars, not for ordering.
We want to adopt our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bown rejected the assumption that after the vote in 2016 the public opinion changed: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and do not want to go out does not really fit the reality."
A member of the Conservative Party and a supporter of Brexit Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, told reporters, "I'm just saying, "Minister, listen to people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not supported by our party and our activists who actually walk the streets and fight for the votes of the voters.
Please reject the Chequers and start listening."
In reference to Theresa May, she added, "Prime Ministers keep their position when they make promises."
Mr. Faraj said politicians should "taste pressure on themselves" if they were going to reject the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us, people and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to say it won't come out of their hands."
In a message to the full enthusiasm of the crowd, he added, "I want our political elite, who is planning to betray Brexit, to feel pressure on herself.
We are mobilising the people's army of this country, which will lead us to victory in Brexit and will never calm down until we become independent, self-employed, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, enemies of the march went through Birmingham and then held a two - year meeting in the city center.
Several activists were waving banners against Brexit after the group was launched.
Laborist Lord Adonis laughed at the conservators because after the conference, security problems arose through their party program.
"These are the people who tell us that they can use the IT systems and technologies needed for Canada-plus, well organized border, free trade with Ireland," he commented.
"It's a complete farce.
There's nothing good in Brexit," he added.
Warren's planning to "consider seriously" the President's job.
The U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that after the November elections, she would be "seriously thinking about taking the president's office."
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday during the general meetings in Western Massachusetts, a representative of the Democratic Party of Massachusetts reported on her future.
Warren, who often criticises President Donald Trump, is fighting in November in the second term against a member of the Republican party Jeff Dill, who was the co-head of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is viewed as the main candidate that can fight the Trump in 2020.
On Saturday morning, her 36th meeting was held with voters in the form of general congregations since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she was planning to take part in the presidential election.
Warren said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and fix the government's work, and for this to happen, there must be a woman on his forehead."
We arrested a suspect in the murder of a firearm by LSU Tigers.
The Baton-Royal Police, Louisiana State, reported on Saturday that a suspect was arrested on Friday for the murder of LSU Tigers.
The Baton-Royal Police Department announced 20-year-old Dieton Simpson's arrest at a press conference at 11 a.m. in the east.
On Friday, they published a video of the shooting asking to help identify the person on it.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot at a campus at the University of Southern on Friday morning.
"Wade Simms got a headshot and died," said Murphy J. Paul, chief of police at 247 sports on Saturday.
Wade joined his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result of the investigation, Simpson was found to have been in a crime scene, had a gun with him, and shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and taken custody of East Boton County police.
Sims, who grew up six feet and six inches and who went to the Junior League, grew up in Baton-Ruz, played 32 games with 10 stars in the last season and on average spent 17.4 minutes in the field, picked 5.6 points and 2.9 picks.
Grand Prie Russia: Louis Hamilton reduced the battle for the title of the world's champion after the team decided to give him the victory over Sebastian Fettel.
Since Walter Bottas left behind Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that Mercedes's decisions will play a significant role in the race.
Bottas had a good start with a semi-post and almost passed Hamilton, who was trying to keep his position on the first two turns and gave Fettel an opportunity to attack his friend on the team.
Fettel went to the pit stop first and left Hamilton on the track in the back of the race, which was about to decide.
The pilot of the Mercedes team went another round and went out behind Fettel, but Hemilton broke into the leadership after a certain maneuver wheel to the wheel, which led Ferrari reluctantly to leave the inner space because of the risk he would be holding, after a double maneuver enabled him to break forward on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen started from the back of the grid and remained in seventh place until the end of the first round.
Then he led most of the race because he did not change the tires so that he could quickly come to the finish and contain Kimi Ryekkonen from fourth place.
In summary, he stopped at the pit stop on the 44th wheel, but couldn't increase the speed of the last eight, because of what Rykkonen planted fourth place.
"It's a difficult day, because Walter was fully exposed to all the outgoings and showed generosity when he gave me the opportunity to go.
The team did an exceptional job to get first and second," said Hamilton.
The Body’s Language Was Not Impressed
At a meeting on Saturday, President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Finstein for her firm stand for not announcing the contents of Christine Blaise Ford's letter, accusing the candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano of sexual violence.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly address the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Legal Committee, but instead expressed his opinion on the events in the Senate, which he said demonstrated to man "insanity, coldness and falsehood."
"The only thing that could happen, and all the wonderful things that have been happening in the Senate for the last few days, is anger, you see the wicked people who demonstrate hypocrisy, hatred and lies," he said.
"You're looking at publications and published information, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diane Finstein, did you announce the information?
Remember her answer... did you announce the contents of the documents? – “What?
Oh, no.
I didn’t announce it.”
Wait a minute.
No, we didn't," he added, copying the senator's behavior.
In July, Finstein came up with a letter containing a detailed statement of charges against Ford against Kavano, and in early September his content was disclosed, but Finstein denied that the leak of information had occurred in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusation, I didn't disclose the information received from her," said Finstein's Committee, reporting to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I didn't break my promise."
However, her denial seemed to dislike the president, who was commenting at the Saturday meeting, "I'll tell you, her body's language was not at all impressive.
Maybe she didn't do it, but I haven't seen anyone holding back worse."
While continuing to defend the candidate to the Supreme Court, whom three women were charged with sexual violence, the president admitted that the democrats used charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to restore power in any necessary way.
You can see the hypocrisy, the coldness, all of them who are offended, who must cross over in order to gain power and control," Mediaite quoted the president as saying.
Elite League: "Dandy Star" -- "Belfast Giants," 5:3
"Jeants" player Patrick Duyer threw two arrows in the match against "Dandi"
"Dandy Star" was rehabilitated for a Friday defeat in the elite league from Belfast Jantes, winning a match-response on Saturday at 5:3.
"Jiants" got an early advantage in two shots thanks to Patrick Duyer and Francis Bowley's kids.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney were comparing the bill in the home match, and then Duyer took the Jiantes out again.
The Dandi player, François Bushar, compared the account, and the two goals of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen were to ensure their victory.
This is the third season of the elite league defeat of Adam Keefe, who won a free win over Dandi at 2:1 p.m. on Friday night in Belfast.
This is the fourth team meeting in the season.
After Kendall McFall was handed over, the first shot by Duyer was thrown at the fourth minute (3:35) and four minutes later, Bovilia, who received the shot from David Rezerford, doubled the bill.
After the tensioned first period at the fourteenth minute (13:10), Sullivan returned the field owners to the game, and at the sixteenth minute (15:16) Kuni, receiving a knife from Matt Markvardt, compared the account.
Düyer gave the Jants priority before the first break, throwing his second shot at the end of the first period.
The owners of the fields were regrouped, and Bushar again, at twenty - eight minutes (27:37), struck the account, throwing away the shield when his command prevailed.
Thanks to the efforts of Kuni and Charles Corcoran Nielsen at the end of the second period, he took Dandi forward for the first time and secured the victory of his team in the fifth half of the last period.
On Friday, the Jiantes team, which has already won four of the last five matches, is playing a final match against Milton-Kinnes.
The air traffic controller died so that hundreds of people on the plane could avoid an earthquake
In Indonesia, the air traffic controller was named a hero after he helped him to fly with hundreds of people at the cost of his life.
More than 800 people died and many lost their lives after a severe earthquake that caused tsunamis on the island of Sulaves on Friday.
Strong underground thrusts continue to shake the area, and many people have fallen into a trap in the city of Palus.
However, unlike his colleagues who fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the skyscraper tower, which was very distraught, at the airport of Mutiaar SIS Al-Jufrey in Pala.
He was in a position to make sure that flight 6321 of the Batik Air, which was then on the landing strip, was safely lifted into the air.
Then he jumped out of the fire tower when he thought it was falling.
Then he died in the hospital.
A representative of the Indonesian air navigation service provider Johannes Siruit said that this decision could save hundreds of lives, reports the Australian Agency ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Callimantan, which was to be transported to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"We're very sorry to hear about this," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are afraid that the number of victims can reach a thousand, because the agency for reducing the effects of natural disasters states that access to the cities of Dongal, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"The number of victims can increase, as many bodies are still under fractures, and many of them cannot be reached," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a representative of the agency.
The waves, with a height of six feet [6 m], devastated the city of Palu, where the mass funerals will take place on Sunday.
Military and passenger aircraft provide assistance and food.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, quick help brings the body.
Clean water is not enough.
Mini-markets are robbed everywhere."
The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, Jan Helfand, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is hurrying to help people who have survived this tragedy, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joco Ododo, came to Pal on Sunday and asked the country's military officers, "I ask you all to work day and night to perform all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" says CNN.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia suffered from earthquakes on the island of Lombok, resulting in the death of more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: As stated in Air Niugini, after the plane crashed into the lagoon, one man disappeared without a message
The airline, which was on a voyage that had suffered disasters in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now claims that one person had disappeared unconscious, although earlier it was reported that all 47 passengers and crew were successfully evacuated from a drowned plane.
In Air Niugini it was said that one passenger could not be found by Saturday.
The airline reports that its representatives are trying to find a man and are working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators.
The airline did not respond immediately to a request for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane landed while trying to land at Chuk Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven men had been taken to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in a stable condition.
The cause of the disaster and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
In the airline and the U.S. VMS, the plane landed in the lagoon near the airstrip.
Some witnesses believe that the plane flew over the flight-ground strip.
U.S. passenger Bill Janes said the plane was very low on the ground.
"That's very good," said Janes.
Janes told me that he and others had managed to get to an emergency exit on a ton of air.
He told me that the stewards panicked and yelled and that he had a mild headache.
In the U.S.A., mariners working close to the modernization of the seabed were also reported to have helped in the rescue operation, delivering people to the shore with an inflated boat before the plane sank at a depth of 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to Aviation Safety Network data in the last two decades, 111 people have died in a plane crash associated with the PNG aircraft, but the list does not include Air Niugini.
An analyst restored the time of the night in which the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution filed a case against a man accused of burning women from Mississippi alive in 2014.
A U.S. Ministry of Justice analyst Paul Roulett witnessed as an expert in operational development for several hours.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to play the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
Roulette, as reported by The Clarion Ledger, reported that he had received information about the location of several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers that night when she died, which contradicted his previous statement.
When the data showed that his cell phone was next to Chambers, although he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to the last one.
On Saturday, Senford witnessed and claimed that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth, when he said that he was at the Sanford Pickup that night, Sanford said he was "falser because my pickup was in Nashville."
Another incompatibility was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Roulette told me that shortly after the death of Chambers Tellis, he had released text messages, calls, and contact information from Chambers on his phone.
"He threw her out of his life," said Gail.
The defense has to set out its concluding arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to be handed over to the jury later that same day.
The High Breed: what is a conscious hip-hop?
Three hip-hop performers want to challenge the negative view of the genre by filling their music with constructive messages.
The High Breed Group from Bristol claims that hip-hop has changed its nature – gone away from political ideas and struggles to solve social problems.
They want to go back to sources and make a conscious hip-hop popular again.
Such artists as The Fugees and Common have recently witnessed this rebirth in the United Kingdom through such groups as Akala and Lowkey.
One more dark skin?
In New York on Thursday, she called for a couple to be released, and received a "racist" message.
In New York, she called for a couple to be discriminated against after receiving an improperly addressed message from her mother complaining that she was "one more dark."
The marriage denies that they are racist, comparing the calls to "requirement".
Linci Plasco-Faxman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she saw that the new nurse, Giselle Morris, arrived on her first working day in 2016, was dark.
"NO, THERE'S ONE DIFFERENT," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Faxman to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending him to her husband, however, she sent him to Miss Morris twice.
As New York Post reports, upon realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plaxon-Faxman felt "uncomfortable" and released Miss Morris, who said that their previous sister-in-law, who was an African American, was doing her job badly and that she was expecting her daughter-in-law from the Philippines instead.
Miss Morris was paid for one day's work and then sent home to Uber.
Now Maurice is putting a couple in court, hoping to get compensation for the amount of pay she would get in six months' work with the couple she was first hired, even without a contract, and she was supposed to pay $350 a day.
"I want to show them what they don't have to do," she said on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
In response to the accusation that they were racist, the couple stated that Maurice’s release was a wise decision because they feared that they would not be able to trust her after being offended.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent her.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said Joel Plasco, her husband.
"But would you leave your children with the man who was rude, even if it wasn't intentional?
Your baby?
All right."
Comparing the call to "requirement," Plasco said his wife gave birth to the child only two months ago and "has not grown up yet."
"Would you avenge anyone after that?
It's a bad act," the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the public opinion court quickly condemned this couple in social networks, criticizing their behavior and logic.
As reported in a new letter, Paddington’s publishers were afraid that readers would not understand the idea of a bear who could speak.
Bonda's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born almost immediately after the book was printed, said about the letter: "It's hard to put herself in the place of the person who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
Now it's funny, because we know about the great success that has been achieved in the story of Paddington."
Telling that her father, who worked as a BBC operator, before the little toy doctor inspired him to write a children's book, had optimized for his work being dismissed, she divided how on the 60th anniversary of the book's release she felt at the same time "joy and sorrow," because her father died a year ago.
With regard to Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," Karen added that her father was quietly proud that the book had become so popular.
"He was quite a modest man and didn't like to brag," she said.
"But Paddington was as real to him as his own child! For when the children reach something, we are proud of them, though it is not theirs, nor our victories.
I think he was looking at Padington's success that way.
Although Padington was the creation of his imagination, he always attributed his success."
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye on the phone
After her daughter was landed, Louis Paster’s hospital in Nice was transferred to two hospitals, where doctors were unsuccessful in trying to save her life.
"Nad regularly called, said it was really bad that she shouldn't have done this," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz.
"And then over called me and said that she would die in the next two minutes and I should say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
The medication that doctors gave her to keep her heart beating, gradually stopped acting and left the body.
She died in a while before everything was turned off.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing what was going on at the time.
I couldn't complain, cry, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really should've held my hand."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who was fueled by the loss of her daughter, was on the plane with other passengers, not paying attention to the severe trials she had to endure.
"No one knew," she said.
"I dropped my head and couldn't hold my tears.
It was hard to explain, but it was just during the flight that I began to feel deep compassion for Nada.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two women who have suffered grief leave leaves leaves to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones in suicide work to prevent others from putting their hands on them.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamphreys are staying on the Wall Street Bridge with phone numbers that people can call for and messages that they should be inspired to write.
Miss Davis Tyler’s son was 13 when he began suffering from depression, and at the age of 18, he put his hands on him.
"I don't want other parents to feel the same way I do every day," she said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Lidney, told me that her son was a promising chef with a lovely smile.
"Everyone knew him for a laugh.
They always said that this smile made any room brighter."
But he quit his job before he died because he was "like in the dark."
In 2014, Tyler’s 11 - year - old brother found his brother’s body after he had laid hands on him.
Ms. Davis says, "I'm always afraid that this will have consequences."
Miss Davis has created letters so that people know that there are those they can turn to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't get caught up in yourself, you need to talk."
Miss Hamphreys, who had been friends with Miss Davis for many years, lost her husband, Mark, with whom she had lived for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt depressed that he had depression or something," she said.
"In a few days before Christmas, we noticed that he changed."
And on Christmas day, he was completely blind to the spirit, and when the children opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye."
She told me that his death had become a huge trauma to them, but they had to survive it: "It's a ruinous thing.
You have to have a family.
But we must continue to live and fight."

The future of Brett Kavano depends on the hair: The FBI is investigating
"I thought if we could get what we asked -- limited in time and nature of the investigation -- we might have reached a certain agreement -- we said on Saturday, Mr. Flake, and added that he was afraid that the committee was "excited" in the background of the unprecedented loss of loyalty of the political party.
Why didn't Mr. Kavano and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their dissatisfaction is related to time.
The interim elections will take place in five weeks, November 6th, and if the Republicans are expected to have problems, it will seriously complicate their efforts by choosing their own person in the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush phoned the senators with a request to support Mr. Kavano, who worked in the White House under Mr. Bush's rule, and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats now sit.
It is still not clear whether Mr. Kavano can obtain at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting, which would enable Vice-President Mike Penso to resolve the problem with the same number of votes and approve his candidacy for the post of judge of the Supreme Court.
During Kim's reign, the number of passersby from North Korea has been reduced.
After Kim Chen In came into power seven years ago, the number of passersby from North Korea to South Korea declined, the South Korean legislator said.
Park Pion Seug, referring to the Ministry of the United Republic of South Korea, said that last year the number of passersby was 1127 compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that border control between North Korea and China had become a key factor, as well as that smugglers who carry illegals are now demanding more money.
In Phenjani, public comments were held back.
The vast majority of the passersby from North Korea are finally offering South Korea citizenship.
In Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans reportedly crossed the border illegally after the Korean war ended in 1953.
Most run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea. It is easier to cross than a well-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between two Koreas.
China views passersby as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is still formally at war, has improved significantly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of two countries met in Phenjana and discussed the issues of denuclearization, the negotiations that had come to an end.
This occurred after the June historic meeting of President Donald Trump and Kim Chen In in Singapore, where they generally agreed to cooperate on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean island.
However, on Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea, in the background of the sanctions, accused the U.S. in the absence of progress since that time.
"With no confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of the security of our country, so under these circumstances there can be no single disarmament," said Rei Yon-Ho in his speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosy calls Brett Cavano "sterical" and says he's not fit for work in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the post of Judge of the Supreme Court Brett Kavano "historic" and said he was not fit for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi expressed her thoughts in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I've always thought that if a woman had ever spoken in this way, she would be called "sterical," "Pelosy commented on her reaction to the testimony of Kavano before the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Coffee emotionally denied charges of sexual violence against Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavano was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and scolding, discussing his family and school years.
He also openly condemned democrats in committee, calling charges against him "absolute and coordinated destruction of the reputation", organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential elections in 2016.
According to Pélosi, Cavano’s testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because it showed his prejudice toward the democrats.
"I think with these statements, as well as his speech against Clinton and the Democrats, he will take his own candidacy," she said.
Pelosi was angry when she was asked if she would try to announce the Kavano implicity if his wine was confirmed and if the democrats received the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this: if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only fit for work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now," said Pelos.
Cavano is currently serving as a judge of the U.S. Court of Appeal in the district of Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a democrat she was concerned about possible solutions to the Kavano against the Law on Access to Medical Services or the Row Against Wade case, as he was considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings on the question of affirmation at Cavano’s office, he turned to the question of whether he would revoke some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
"Not now when the judge becomes an hysterical, prejudiced person, and we'll say how great it is," said Pelosi.
Women must have this weapon.
These are just words that have been stored up for months and years of anger, and she could not speak them without tears.
"We cry when we get angry," she told me 45 years later, Miss Steinham.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued: "A woman who worked as an executive director and helped me very much said she was crying when she got angry, but she had her own methodology, and when she got angry and started to cry, she said to her coworker, "You can think I'm sad and that's why I'm crying.
And I am evil."
And then she just went on.
I thought it was incredible."
The tears are viewed as an acceptable way out of anger in part because they are perceived differently.
One of my earliest memories of my first job in the office, where mostly men worked, became a situation when I once cried out for unspoken anger, and the older woman, an unwelcome manager, whom I was always a bit afraid of, grabbed me by the cell and dragged me to the eastern cell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be glad they got to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Garth in the presidential elections.
In 1987, when Mr. Garth was caught on a non-marriage boat by the name of Monkey Business, after which he left the race, deeply disappointed Ms. Schroeder decided that there was no reason why she could not compete for the president's office.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," she said to me with a smile 30 years later.
"The race has already been attended by seven other candidates, and another candidate is the last one they needed."
Someone called it "Biosnejka and Seven Gnoms".
Since this was at the end of the campaign, she left the congregation with the cost, and she promised that she would not take part in the race if she did not collect $2 million.
It was a hopeless battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who did not harm her husband’s support of $1,000, gave her only $250.
"They think they'll give me a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave a speech and announced that she would not conduct an official campaign, she was touched by the emotions — the gratitude of the people who supported her, the disappointment of the system, which made it very difficult to collect money and forced her not to focus on voters, but on members of the House of Deputies, and the anger of sexism, she was ready to cry.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalls Miss Schroeder in a press reaction.
You'd think Kleinex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking about what they would write on my tombstone?
"Did she cry?"
How the U.S. - China’s Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in a trade war between the United States and China have been desperate, and, although far away from its completion, in the long run, differences between countries can benefit Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump made the first warning shots early this year, taxing Chinese export goods, including solar batteries, steel, and aluminum.
The biggest situation this week was compounded by new tariffs for goods at a total cost of $200 billion (150 billion) that actually covers half of all the goods coming from the United States with China.
Beijing paid back the same coin every time, recently paying a fee of between five and ten percent on American goods for $60 billion.
China has committed itself to using similar U.S. measures, and the second largest economy in the world will hardly be able to keep this promise in the near future.
Making Washington resign means agreeing with the requirements, but for President China C. Zinpina, U.S. public worship is too shameful.
However, according to experts, if Beijing makes the right use of the situation, pressure in the U.S. trade war can bring China a long-term advantage by reducing the relationship between the two economies.
"A rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to a sharp economic downturn in any of the countries, and this is actually a greater threat than observers have acknowledged before," said an analyst named Abigail Grace, who is dealing with Asia-related issues at the Center for New American Security analytical center.
Foreign Minister said Syria is "ready" to return refugees
In Syria it is reported that they are ready to return to their country of refuge and are seeking help to rebuild a war - torn country that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking before the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Valid al-Mualem, stated that conditions in the country would improve.
"Today, the real situation has become more stable and secure as a result of the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the devastated areas of the region so that people can return to normal life.
All conditions have now been created for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that had to be abandoned through terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and limited their means of livelihood.
According to the United Nations, over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million more people still live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem stated that the Syrian government would be pleased to receive assistance in restoring the war-torn country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional help or help from countries that support the attack.
Europe Strengthens the Victory of the 'Cube Ryder' in Paris
The European team won the Cup of Ryder in 2018 when it won the U.S. team with a summary account of 16.5:10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburb of Paris, France.
The U.S. team has suffered defeats in Europe for the sixth time and has not won the Kubok Ryder tournament since 1993.
Europe returned to the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Byron’s team took 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
The American Phil Michelson star, who tried most of the tournament by all means, was the first to hit the 16th lunce pair-3 in the water and took Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all his rounds and became one of the four players who ever had a 5-0-0-0 account from the beginning of the tournament in modern format in 1979.
American Jordan Spitt suffered defeats at 5:4 from a player with the lowest rating in the European team Turbiern Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who is the first climber in the world rankings, took place at 2:1 Jan. Poulter from England, who may have participated in the last Cup of Ryder tournament.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran "Cube Ryder", who had already participated in the tournament eight times, became a European who won the tournament most of the time, bringing 25.5 points for his career.
"I don't usually cry, but there's nothing I can do today.
It was a tough year.
Thank you Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to return the cube.
It's the merit of the team, and I'm glad that I was able to help," said Garcia, without stopping emotion after victory in Europe.
He's handing over the esophagus to his roommate, John Rem, who won the U.S. Gulf of Tiger Woods on Sunday in a solo game with a 2:1 account.
"I feel incredibly proud of the victory over Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
In France, Woods lost all four matches and now has a career record on the Cup of Ryder 13-21-3.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players of all time who won 14 major tournaments, only Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. Assembly throughout the weekend tried to reach the Ferway area, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Fina, who had a high - quality golf course throughout the tournament.
Captain U.S.A. Jim Furick said about his team after the unpleasant speech, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we dominated Europe.
We fought.
I'm taking off my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're regrouping, I'm going to work with the Association of Professional Players in the U.S. Golf and the Cup of Ryder tournament committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
They're not to be commended.
We've lost."
Current Red Flood Information: Reduction of concentration in the Pinellas, Manat and Sarasota districts
The latest report by the Florida Committee on Fish and Wild Nature shows the overall decline in the colouring of red microorganisms in some parts of the Tampa Bay.
According to Florida’s Committee on Fish and Wild Nature, the conditions of intense flowering reported in certain areas of the districts of Pinellas, Manat, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collière are evidence of a decrease in concentration.
The flowering of the red - colored microorganisms extends to about 130 miles [130 km] of the shoreline from the north of Penellas to the southern regions of Lee.
The flags can be found about 10 miles [10 km] from the coast of Hillsboro, but they are less than last week.
The Red Flood was also observed in the region of Pasco.
Last week, average concentrations were reported in the Pinellas district and its coastal zone, low to high in the coastal district of Gillsboro, high concentration in the county of Manat, high concentration in the county of Sarasota and its coastal zone, medium concentration in the county of Charlotte, high concentration in the county of Lee and in its coastal zone, and low concentration in the county of Collaire.
In the districts of Pinellas, Manat, Sarasota, Lee, and Collière, there are reports of the respiration of respiratory organs.
Such reports were not recorded in northwestern Florida last week.
