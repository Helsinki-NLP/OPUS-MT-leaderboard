She's got too much work to do.
She's an enemy.
Give Tom a handle.
You wouldn't like Tom.
Does Tom know how you feel about him?
Tom wondered if what Mary said was true.
We'll never agree.
It is uncertain whether or not the letter ever appeared.
We haven't done anything.
You lost your pen.
You're gonna be in bed all day, aren't you?
Tom can't do that.
Tom creaked under the roof.
I didn't even know her name.
Are you really gonna do that?
Give this to Tom.

Happy birthday.
I don't even want you here.
I like to go to new places and see new things.
I have to sit down.
Aren't we friends?

Kate's cold.
I know you're missing your family.
What was your plan?
Tom seems exhausted.
He's not angry.
There's no doubt about who's being elected.
He got hurt.
Maybe I should find a new job or an interesting hobby to keep me motivated.
It's weird.
Have you read Sagan about ring trilogy?
I'm a man now.
Greek is not an easy language.
Thank you for taking care of my dog.

Tom's helping.
One morning he saw a cute girl.
This tree is not even near being the highest in the grass.
Let me take a look.
Tom wants our help.
Time's up.
My dad's healthy.
We can save many lives.
If you don't have the money, you'll be fine without it.
I'm afraid to go home.
Just say it.

Put the cake on the table.
I know you're angry.
Do you need anything?
I want a pair of gloves.
That's exactly what I needed.
I'm from Brazil.
I'm already late.
Even mom knows about it.
He should've already done it.
Room service, please.
Who were you talking to?
The boy took the cat's tail.
How do you know?
I got a lot of soft beds.
I'm unemployed.
This medicine will cure your cold.
Does this remind you of anyone?
I'd like to talk to Tom between four eyes.
He'll fall for the temptation.
Teven doesn't work.
I can explain.
She's acting like a child.
What does it look like?
Mary thinks she has superpowers.
I can do all this.
Everyone needs to know.
After the stop, the train accelerated quickly.
What did that mean?
Who do you want to talk to?
No one has asked you to support, but can you at least accept that there are people who have opinions other than you?
Tom dropped the book.
I'm the best.
English is hard, isn't it?
I can go to school in ten minutes.
Are you ready now?
She couldn't think of seeing him again.
Even during working hours, I pay for my Internet addiction in the country.
I never thought it would be so hard to create an iPad app.
You haven't been gone in a long time.
Both Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
I can't get down to town.
It wasn't boring at all.
Can you freeze it down?
Tom flashed with the light of hell.
Are you threatening me?
Tom's worried.
I used to like to come here.
This isn't a fish.
Tom and Mary may not have done it all they say they did.
There's no one here who's called.
It's time to go.
All three men are lying.
Come and sit down.
It has to work.
Tom made his parents happy.
Tom needs me.
My motorbike's a mess.
You think she's pretty, don't you?
He lived a simple life.
This is gonna take years.
I spelled the word wrong.
I don't like this book.
A blackfish has ten arms.
She didn't come before two.
I am.
It was very good.
Come talk to me.
He took care of the baby.
Leave me alone!
I had never seen such a peaceful view.
Tom's fast.

Unfortunately, Tom took care of himself.
What is the difference between American and British English?
I'll read the book.

Where is she?
It feels really good.
Why do you like it?
What would you say if you were in this situation?
Give me three weeks.
The driver's mad at the steering wheel to the right.
I'm on the wind.
Tom said he didn't eat meat.
Didn't you win?
All dreams.
Mills are made of wheat.
How did you get this?
Is that relevant?
You gave it to me.
