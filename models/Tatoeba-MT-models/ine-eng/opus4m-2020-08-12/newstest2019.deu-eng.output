Hvar - flirting, cooking, seducing - no simple tasks for our girls.
Especially when a friend is waiting in Germany.
Nevertheless, the nine "Beautiful Municher" candidates deliver the shot with people photographer Tuan and boast wind, poison and rain like a real professional.
The romantic shooting is in the video:
DFB-Chief Grindel doesn't see any basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel is currently seeing no basis for a return from Mesut Özil to the national team.
"That's a question that of course depends on one's having a conversation, that one's also talking to him about why he's obviously felt it as it is in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Prasenmehrer" of the "Image-Time.
Despite the recent debate on the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the retreat of the 92-fold national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed that this would be the case until a certain time," Grindel said.
In July the 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team and also justified him by not defending him from racist attacks during the WM.
The DFB chief repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with Federal Coach Joachim Löw and Team Manager Oliver Beerhoff.
He doesn't want to build any pressure, but he knows it from the football so that if you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with his coach and I find it harmful that this conversation has not been made so far."
Linz: Garden hut burned in Schrebergartensilung
At 2.13 p.m., the Linz firearm was alarmed to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the Schrebergarten settlement, there was a delay in danger.
The firearm went out and found the cabin in full-fledged.
The roof had to be practically removed and fire protection was removed to the necessary extent.
According to the owners of the burning garden, he had a battery to charge by noon.
That might be the brand issue.
In any event, the charger was located according to firearms in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still needs to be identified - as well as the cause of the fire.
However, it should be significant because the owner had many pieces in his garden.
Angry mother protests: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the open road
What has Lindsay Lohan only driven into this extremely strange action?
She apparently wanted to enter the children into an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fullly Loaded") has flown live herself, as she apparently wants to enter a family in Moscow.
This reports on the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial medium of the stream.
Here you can see "Good luck" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip is to see Lohan get out of a car and go to a possibly homeless family who wants her out of Syria as a refugee family.
When the family flees right before the actress, Lohan persecutes the parents and their children.
She sees the adult children's trade.
For all this, she doesn't deliver any evidence in the clip.
"The whole world sees it right," Lohan is listening in the video as she continues to follow the family along the street.
Apparently she's trying to separate the children from her parents.
At some point, however, it seems to be enough for the apparently angry mother.
It looks like she's turning around and Lohan's missing an earpiece.
Under tears, the actress appreciates how shocked she is - and she holds the swing.
What Lohan has moved to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroids
The probe "Hayabusa2" started in December 2014 in Japan.
It is intended to approach the asteroid Ryugu so close that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to the earth.
The lander "Mascot" will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign Ticker: The number of deaths in Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of strength 7,5 and subsequent tsunamis on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 victims died.
The number of victims can still rise.
The rescue teams have not yet moved into areas that are devastated and cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla supervisor
At the beginning there was a second.
Tesla-Chief Elon Musk was worried about the stock markets at the beginning of August when he announced a withdrawal of the car manufacturer.
The U.S. stock exchange supervisor accused him of fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla chief withdraws from the Board of Supervisors, but the Chairman of the Board may remain.
Party day of British Conservatives
Sharp watch - the party day of the Tories
Birmingham will be the stage of a power struggle.
On the day of the party, foreign policy, trade and development policy is to be discussed, but the four-day conference between Prime Minister Theresa May and Brexit-hardliners is to be held, to the front of Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum for a new national name
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state on the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about these name doubles for years.
Now they've agreed.
The state of Macedonia is going to call future North Macedonia and this is what the population is thinking about this Sunday - is it all right?
Protests in Brazil against legal populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("He doesn't") - means Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country was divided.
Thousands went to the streets in several cities to protest against the legal populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" is an anti-system candidate and is thus in the front of the polls.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad from the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: Dieselgate processing takes longer than planned
"The Diesel Task Force still exists," said Development Board Peter Mertens to the industry's "Automobile Week".
In December 2017, the arrested and licensed head of Audi Rupert Stadler announced that the task force will soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018, it is likely that all engine/driving combinations have been tested," he said at the time.
Mertens now said: "At the beginning of July we have reached an important goal in the processing of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The Task Force was founded in September 2015 following the discovery of the diesel candal at the Audi-Mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the autobuilder had made "graving organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never occur again.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and wanted to continue its discussion this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities shall submit to the head of the hearing to authorise the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values after the waste fraud has been reported.
He knew about the manipulations or he deliberately ignored them.
At present, the sales board is leading the company as the head of the board of directors.
Due to the change to the new exhaust and consumption test standard WLTP there are production accidents in Audi, the "Heilbroner Voice" said.
Basically, he sees a decreasing demand for limousines such as the A6, A7 and A8 audio models produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment on itself is difficult," he said.
Shots on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there are already 15,000 reservations.
Grindel wants re-election - Lahm should be in the DFB Bureau
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel will, despite criticism of his person after the WM and Özil affair in the coming year, re-appropriate for the office as DFB President.
"I do my job and try to make it as good as it is," Grindel said as a guest at the ZDF's "Current Sports Studio" early Sunday morning.
You have to try again and again to re-election, I will.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
According to his own words, the head of the association found it "wonderful" if, after the award for the football-EM 2024, he did not "want to work on the future project".
Grindel has been the successor of Wolfgang Niersbach, a member of the Sommermärchen affair.
In autumn 2016 he was elected for a first full three-year term of office.
The next vote will take place at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM Chief Organizer Philipp Lahm will be involved in the DFB Bureau.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that in this role he was also in the Bureau with advice and then of course was cordially invited to provide his experience in sporting matters," Grindel said.
In speculations whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB chief, he did not want to participate.
As a consequence of the affair around the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that in the future a national player without a migration background would become the DFB's integration messenger.
Currently, this office of native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic has family roots in Cameroon.
"If a non-migration background significantly affects society and football and says, 'the issue is important, then we have to take care of it', that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local associations where integration needs to work," Grindel said.
Properly reduce with half-clumsy weight
I've had a new toy for four weeks.
A weight that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat part.
Musculoskeletal and bone mass can also be shown.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it's more for the urticaria.
But he doesn't say anything about whether I've replaced fat with muscle.
basketball-Bundesliga: Clear launches for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin has started with a clear victory in the new season of the basketball Bundesliga.
Against Science City Jena, the vice-master won without any problem with 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing party over 40 minutes.
New access Rokas Giedratis was the top score of the dominant Berliner with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 numerator) from Ludwigsburg also presented an attractive performance to 9113 spectators in his performance performance.
Ex-Master Brose Bamberg won the performance performance by Coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at S.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was a 24-point best seller for the guests.
Würzburg-Profi Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 counts.
Last year's playoff semifinalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg forced the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New National Player Karim Jallow was the 24-point best-run shooter on Coach John Patrick's team.
The EWE basketball Oldenburg started the new game time with a clear success.
At the basketball game Lionen Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new gamemaker Will Cummings won the Oldenburgers with 25 numerators.
Braunschweiger, in which NBA-Star Dennis Schröder is the majority owner since the beginning of the season, was disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1-run of the basketball quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdoğan Moschee opens in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism in Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to deliver the Golden Movement's adherents living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow supporters of the PKK or the Golden Movement to shock our citizens and damage the German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the ditib mosque, the Cologne city was partially blocked.
Several thousand policemen were in use - including sharp shields.
The Islam Association Ditib is in criticism because it is considered to be an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizens Festival": music against poverty: stars, drums and seconds of terror
Artists such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B spent more time in a concert in New York Central Park in the fight against poverty and disease.
"Involve you wherever you can wherever you can only," Mendes said at the festival on Sunday night in front of about 60.000.
Thank you for coming here, it's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with French and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I switch, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and relief organizations, also appeared on stage at the multi-hour show.
In the meantime, however, there was a seconds of fear when many spectators felt the sound of an overwhelming metal block for shootings, got scared and tried to flee.
A short panic arose, people ran into each other.
Seven spectators were easily injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
However, the New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed people out of the stage.
"No one's trying to hurt anyone," Martin said.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge on the Internet as every year.
Those who wanted to catch one had to read and distribute texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors, there were the Jubel and Applaus - Buhrufe for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
This, together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons, spoke on the stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had announced himself to the U.S. Senate Justice Committee for the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh as judge at the Supreme Court and thereby hit many women in front of the head.
At least three women have raised allegations of abuse up to the attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which it rejects.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the allegations after two women who reportedly experienced sexual abuse themselves faced him on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also join me at any time in an elevator," Flake now said at the New York concert about the audience.
Freedom of the press: Federal government defends the journalist's expulsion
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended the release of a journalist from the press conference by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the office, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had passed a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone to the first series.
The T-shirt, if it wasn't the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was a disruption of the press conference.
The actions of the journalist have caused a great deal of anxiety, which is not acceptable.
That's why he caused a man to be taken out by a security guard.
Seibert said it was not allowed to demonstrate political affairs at press conferences in the Federal Office.
This applies entirely whether or not it is a legitimate matter.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are subjected to alleged espionage or support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah Gulen movement.
The Turkish leadership is responsible for the failure of the Putsch test on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists threatened several decades of detention.
Also foreign journalists are not sure of the Turkish authorities: At the beginning of September, the Austrian journalist Max Zirgast was arrested.
Recently, the cases of the arrested journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had provided for supervision.
Although they came free and were able to return to Germany, there are still processes against the two in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him so fresh and well: Florian David Fitz.
There you have to look twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for wet-earned chats at the Hamburg Port Kneepe "Shellfishposten".
Moderator Ina Müller meets with her guests on some beer, some wine or even higher drinks to unlock the mood and tongue.
Not only are there few promises of courage for the compulsory singing arrangements.
On Friday, another result of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz is famous for films such as "men's hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Best Day".
The Municher received the trip to the high north, but it was not good.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely scratched on it, the eyes are only two small cracks.
The bed-selfie shows a fully-fledged Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he only has a powerful catheter.
Addressing his fans, he posted some – probably not quite serious – findings he has now won: "Rule one: DO NOT go to Inas at night.
Rule two: Never drink the black sauce.
And Spritz.
And the round egg licorice, which throws about half three, also leaves.
Alcohol consumption is really written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans posted a few tips to fight the afterlife.
They reach from instant bread, fish bread or - probably the most targeted - headache tablets.
Others were simply amusing themselves with the view of the normally attractive kinotar.
As Ina Müller has survived the night shift, it is not yet known.
Since it has moderated the TV fun at the teke since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be clearly tempted...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight vandalism and unrest
The entrance to the 36 km long railway track in the Red Cape Country in Treysa is difficult to find and melt.
Recipes against fattening vandalism are being sought, but solutions hardly stand out.
Shrimps, cigarettes, garbage and unravels, demolished garbage cans and currently dismantled clues - this is how the entrance with a seat group is presented on the Haaße hill in Treysa for a long time.
For the prodigy railway road in the Red Cape country, there is more than an unspoilt view.
The topic concerns members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for a long time, according to the city’s cycling officer Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been addressed in the bike transport council.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals range from the removal of the seat group to the regular disposal of the waste containers and the cleaning of the surfaces at the entry point.
"I think the last would be the order of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been introduced into the local council.
Not only does the garbage drive bikers and residents around - the seat group is at the weekly regular meeting point for the celebration.
Not only does it often sound, but it also destroys the furniture: dusts are torn out of the earth, scraps are demolished, paintings are reworked, and furniture is painted.
Volunteers had already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions, however, were only the verbal drop on the hot rock.
They are angry that the Rastplatz on the bike path in Treysa is the meeting point for the suction.
"As long as the whole cycle path is located here on the Haaße-Hügel is clearly the focus," confirms the cyclist, who now also takes care of the new railway station in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be quite expensive."
Another idea was video surveillance on the hill: "Maybe this puts the threshold significantly higher to grasp the communion.
This would, however, require that a police strike be avoided in time.
In principle, Desert Hagen wants a development of the Haase hill.
He has to be more attractive.
You can be very satisfied with the frequency of the cycle so far.
The tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is very high in Germany, according to ADFC members.
As an extremely critical danger point, ADFC member Susanne is assessing the situation in the Ascheröder Straße in Treysa.
There's no sign of absconding on the Haast hill.
In the case of traffic, it may happen that bicycle drivers must wait in the middle of the road between the two sides of the traffic stream," she explains.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but for older people and especially for children.
Music-Contest at the cultural train station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music context was a success, creative and in partnership.
"D to sing a song for Hiltrup", says the appeal of the city's part offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music Contest for large and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with eyelids in the sympathetic Hiltuper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family reunion with coffee and cakes from the honorary officials of the cultural train station.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jessica with Pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with Guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-standing albatross in Hiltrup living, the nine of the "Hiltuper Star colours", three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus, an ensemble from the children's garden Lummerland and finally Ricke Weßling and the Quartes.
This contest, said Mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a novelty.
We have not experienced this in other parts of the city.
Why did the textures come together?
The places of the Hiltruper Lake and the Marktallee were particularly frequently mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig praised the Allee in his striking song "Kö von Hiltrup".
The cultural train station was also honored.
Again and again it was about the experience of each other in these places, especially at Alvin Jessica.
Karl Franke experienced the short conversion tours with short interviews with the interpreters or clues to their creation.
So you learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now he's also teaching guitar.
From sound technician Stefan Schemmelmann, Frank knew that he had recently appeared in Ludwigshafen - at a large BASF event with Barclay James Harvey in the program.
And Alvin Jessica put everything on youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltuper Gastronomy.
However, for the jury's favorites there was something special - so that others could also hear their songs.
An entire CD can be played by Alvin Jessica and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound technician Shemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup-Slamer, the Franke particularly impressed with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very beautiful performance" with ten children and two educators at guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Toölle.
Like everyone else, the children appeared at the end again - and even sound "very good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
Leading the jury was the originality of the aspects, the link to Hiltrup, the entry of the melody and the recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische School for Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Economics Association, as well as Jan Kaven, president of the district offensive.
The city offensive had brought the event to life on the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She valued the event as a complete success.
All were "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural train station.
The word type game: "Decrypto" in the game
The players form two teams that match each other.
For each page there is a screen containing four cards with keywords that can only be deciphered when inserted - the old trick with the red foil.
In this way it is ensured that the opposite side can also read nothing out of hand.
On the cards then stands for example, read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2. Window.
3. Pumps.
Four parties."
These are the terms that should be used to encrypt.
Because it's not supposed to be the terms here, it's code.
By contrast, a player per team is the cipher.
It gets a code card on which it might be "3.4.2".
"Decrypto" is not supposed to be the terms behind the cover, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: He should describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "pulls", "fest" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team is not possible; for this wins the party if it manages to break the code twice.
So the coder notes and reads aloud: "Throw" for the dice, "lose" as the opposite for the party; of course, this would also be possible as "Party" and "Prag" because he's been watching the school and knows the window crash there.
So it goes round for rounds, team for team.
Although you do not know the terms of the opposite side, you can better combine them with any reference the cipher gives there.
As mysterious as possible, but not to be reversed, the transcripts should therefore be otherwise made unnecessary to his team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptographic of "decrypto" is the rule book.
The players probably have to study it for quite a long time and in detail until they can finally play it.
The explanation video under decrypto.info on the network makes it easier.
But whoever has just released will be fascinated by how much feeling there is in this invisible game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not as crucial as predecessors and genre-primus "codenames", which is also a theme of agents on a game with fewer words, but it is much better to play in small groups.
And who is only about advice and not about points of victory, it can also easily find a version for two.
Kulbach: Man shows police Hitler's size and insults guests in the kneipe
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspector Kulbach twice on Sunday night.
He first showed Hitler’s size in the upper city of a passing police station, and later he also fell into a cage in the upper city when he harassed other guests.
After he did not comply with the police's notice, he had to spend the night at the Kulmbach police inspectorate in the prison cell.
In the immediate state, he must then also be criminally liable for the use of signs of constitutionally unconstitutional organizations.
Operational work Pressig was home to the school blocks
The railway plant in Pressig was the turning disc in Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history was completed.
"When buffers knocked on buffers, they were heard in all the press," remembers Georg Dinkel, who archived the history of the place and the station.
That didn't set anyone up.
There the brakes were still and the wagons were kneading.
That was just a clean railway.
Statements that make sense for Dinkel's home pressig.
Nowhere in Frankenwald was such a place by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the Steilerampen mountain range to the north, which after an increase of about 220 meters high has its starting point in Steinbach am Forest.
In order to deal with this, earlier train and shoe blocks were needed, which had their home in the press.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 lokschuppen, a training workshop, a driving and railway trade fair.
"Herzstück was the turning disc, which after a conversion in 1899 had a diameter of 18 meters," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and 47 years of professional railway.
Pressig, which was submitted to Bamberg in 1968, also operated Loks for the sidelines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - North Half.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported on a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were then stationed in pressig.
The electrification of the 1939 route has already minimized the need for train and school blocks.
Since 1977 they have only been used in freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10,000 roads were still in place.
In 1982, parts of the plant were destroyed, 1991.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that you have not noticed a better use of the site, even in the point of freight."
Even at Pentecost 1989, the Nürnberg Railway Directorate celebrated the anniversary of "50 years of electrification Nürnberg - Saalfeld" in Pressig.
"There were 10,000 excited spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Pressig Ranger Station was history.
"The Rangers and the disabled did the most difficult work in train transport," Dinkel recalls.
Any mishandling would have had fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen station has led to the conversion of the hierarchy of both places and many other historical and current images are found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledonsieger Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have already reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the French Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the third world rankings is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spanish Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the Russian placed on number 13.
The Swabin is now able to do it with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
Within the "Art and Joy" series, a special exhibition was opened at the weekend in Mittelhrenbach.
With great ease, the eventers and visitors were looking at the ideal weather when the special Vernissage "Windspiel-performance" was opened in the free country of Dahlmann-Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the roof of the tourism club "Round around Walberla" in the "Art and Pleasure" series.
This opened its doors in the 15th year.
A great visitor's reputation showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 Copies of 20 artists are now available in Mittelhrenbach.
Hausser Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to open the painting.
He's been doing it himself since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who became the main organizer and artist of the same name.
A little surprised, however, Hahn announced his retreat a few days ago.
With Tania Angelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he put his task in proven young hands with a good perspective for the future.
Both have been active in the past in the selection of artists and in the design of flyers.
Also this year there is once again a 70-cent special stamp designed by Kunst & Genuss, available at every art station.
There, this year's poster "Betzn Astanzen", by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high demand for the special exhibition.
For the musical framework Max Marcus Stadler could be won from Nuremberg.
During the walk through the generous garden, it is quickly clear to the visitor that the title "windgame performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and finally expresses it.
It is made of metal or ceramics, often with colored accents.
Already at the entrance of the presence, visitors are waiting on the right-hand side of the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree trunk, colorfully lit, playful with 20 windmills, 24 hoods and 24 alu tubes provided as a sound piece.
With the sun shining through the bushwork in the background, the object seems to be strikingly reconciled and invites to stay.
From the corner valley, Barbara Washneck is dedicated in three dimensional letters to the event of 15 years K&G.
There are many parts in the wind in motion.
On the half-way, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind The Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful fantasy image of sound, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" is to shine through the versatile art exhibition.
Until December 31, 2018, the special exhibition can be visited.
50 years MGV 68 Albacht: Singers celebrate 50th birthday festive
1968 - that was the time of the protest and the student movement.
And at that time the al-Qaeda people also made air for their ill-fated souls.
At least five of them.
They didn't want to think everywhere that there should be no more singing life in the area after the church choir "Cécilia".
It has now become a legend: At a bank in the Tinnenbusch they lifted the MGV 68 Albachts from the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Meeting".
"It will be full today," said President Jürgen Holstiege, and he should keep right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albanian singers.
Especially for the anniversary, they had reinvigorated the foundation party.
For years it was a tradition, then there was only a break.

Volleyball: 3. League of Women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The elevator's marching.
Three games, three wins - the reserve of the USC Münster under the control of Axel Buring is correctly located in Liga three.
No trace of Scheu or Fracksausen, the Independents do their thing.
And that's right at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against the city competitor BW Aasee.
"That wasn't clear, but we've already left the impression," says the somewhat satisfied coach.
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker immediately committed to: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not unhappy." On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday party by Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game was torn off.
Yes, the result is actually an optical distortion.
In the third sentence, the guests had a satzball.
"If they bring it to an end, such a game can be missed once," knows Buring from years of experience.
Finally, with its routine forces, the USC made everything clear and brought the full benefits to the goal.
"We are all aware of who is in such a Derby on the other side.
That doesn't break our genetics.
I've seen a really good volleyball," Annacker didn't have the 0:3 - and immediately went over to the agenda.
Where the journey goes for the independent, it does not seem noticeable after just three playing days.
"It's too early for that," says Axel Buring.
Only in one feels he confirms: "The 3rd League has an incredibly good level.
This is not comparable to regionalliga volleyball." In the fourth league, however, they do not want to direct their views further down.
If the west is not polluted in the next few weeks, they have to look up.
However, a first balance sheet can only be drawn from ten or eleven parties.
On Saturday, it only goes to Emlichheim.
Aasee will join in food on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans of Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the dream ship, Heide Keller became the star.
Now she is openly saying that the series could have had a pity on her marriage with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as chief chef Beatrice of Ledebur on the "Dreamship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she went on board forever.
The series that made them the star could be co-responsible for their failed marriage to Hans of Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she had been married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason too.
Because I was raised with this work, traveling alone with a suitcase around the world, and many of my admired colleagues took me to eye height," Keller relates in the conversation with the "Picture on Sunday".
At first, she was always only "the wife of Hans of Borsody", but that changed with the "dream ship".
Because now the journalists are only calling at Heide Keller.
"If he likes it so well, I don't know."
She considers it possible that her husband at that time might have been quite needy, but "how many men also shot Hans's conversation about problems and feelings".
Keller has always tried to be Hans of Borsody "the only one right and he wanted to know my fears not to know my weaknesses.
That means good German: I understood," as she further explained.
She's always had the feeling that "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman who I was never in the truth, even though I sometimes appeared bold and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "though I was afraid that it might happen a second time."
On the day before the official wedding, I was sitting in the dressing room smiling and wanted to give up everything.
The marriage of Borsody also failed.
Why didn't it ever hit the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had the love at that time "as shown in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I've gone too naive to love."
The nightfaller, who regularly explores the nightlife of the city in the NZZ resort Zurich, has this time stood up to the ZFF opening party.
Our fold is not mott, but a little light.
And the green glow, in which a green carpet is immersed in the hexagonal place, blinds it over the fee.
But it's a film festival, where more or less famous people want to sunbathe.
This way, on this late Thursday night, he wanders over the square to relax briefly in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oase".
This is the name of the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: The need facility in the partnership of a new pavilion has a great deal of effort to flow a luxurious atmosphere.
This evening, however, it smells in the Lord's Oasis for some reason to heaven.
So get out here, across the other side of the street: Glad guests who have been having a good time in the cinema next to the opening film "Green Book" at the best level, celebrate the festival with a party in the three-story warehousing.
Its name fits perfectly with this film party: The works shown are known to come from all over the globe.
What must not be allowed to interfere with an article about this festival in order not to fall into auctions for its 190 partner companies.
The fold connects a band around the sensors that has signed him a good fee, and two bully doorkeepers actually invite him in.
Drinnen pushes the trucks, they dance far after midnight to live music or can be seen by DJ rhythms to which they cry each other, and wash down with Cüplí exquisite hippies.
In the delicacy shop in the basement, Austria waits for sparkling mouthpieces, besides the unparalleled raw ham of Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain is sprayed.
And the Hammer is: All the sales rules with exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been so for years, so it seems to work without major losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The folder studies the shield at the escalator: "Bring a long dress, please be careful on the escalator".
If it were two separate instructions, he'd be in the dress code.
But it's rather a conditional construction, and that has saved life.
In the household goods department at the top floor, the bird picks up a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", suitable for the festival award.
This mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself, does not necessarily receive the price for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been running for a brand for years, is not here at night either.
However, between local prominence, cassette and kitchen articles, there is a face that is familiar to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
That shouldn't be his main performer.
And really: Viggo Mortensen walks right through the lot, with almost sixty-six acting like a chorus.
He's not being quarried, he's not drunk, he's got to steal the most.
Just for this resurgence, like to be misunderstood as obscurity, international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dances
Trainer and former football star Diego Maradona is pleased with the victory of his team.
Argentina's football legend Diego Maradona seems to have lived well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2:0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin at Cumbia rhythmmen, as shown in a video already released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in the yellow tricot, fired by the players.
The Mexican second-lighted man had defeated the Leones Negros by 2:0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona called in a TV camera "Always with my boys, always".
The 57-year-old is training the Mexican club since the beginning of September.
Handball: Association League 1: USA Send to Last Minute Pleite "at the ground destroyed"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the US handball leaguer, could hardly capture it: "So a bitter defeat". His guards were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - Pleite - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germany 2.
They had not played bad - like in Steinhagen, like against Hüllhorst - over long stages, the transmitters.
Only the initial phase "we've been totally asleep", the US coach got angry.
The houseowners quickly led by 8:1, even the early time that Bieletzki had taken did not fruit first.
"But then suddenly a back went through the team," Bieletzki stuck together the second quarter hour.
The rest was only two doors for a break.
Especially sentencing Best, Marius Hintze, met again in the phase.
After the change, it got even better from a visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst left at 15:15, followed by the shifter almost continuously.
Four minutes before the siren, the opening was still seemingly relaxing three hits (29:26).
And then?
Take the unpartisan into account.
Bieletzki tends to be careful to look for fault with others.
But: The 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühloff cancelled, "was a joke".
LIT had a good laugh and met four more times to the end - during the decadent US also failed in the last attack.
The boys have fought great, even behind them against seven men and have thrown them back and forth on the empty gate.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now there must be a damn victory," said the restless berident Bieletzki.
U.S. Tower: Hindze (9), Ernst (6), Schlågl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühloff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hungry (1).
Bayern: Woman missing for 30 years - Police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of an 18-year-old from Naila (Landkreis Hof), the police are looking for the women's mortal remains.
On Saturday at Marxgrün, an action force will dig up a road.
In this regard, the road cover and several layers of it have been reported jointly by the police and the public prosecutors.
According to new findings, the missing may not have been buried far away from their home at that time.
The woman has disappeared since 4 November 1986.
At that time, the investigators did not exclude a crime.
Since last year, the Criminal Police Hof has been working with the Public Prosecutor's Office on the case again intensively.
Together with scientists at the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian Memorial Protection Authority, the investigators, through a ground radar, stood at a level below the road near Marxgreen.
With the help of a dog trained on the smell of human bones, the officers limited the position to a few meters.
The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows what dangers they face in the network.

In addition, security updates, such as for Windows, should be installed soon, and it does not harm to equip computers with antivirus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of Tesla’s electric car manufacturer, has been removed from his threatening appeal as head of the billions of heavy companies.
He and the U.S. stock exchange supervisor SEC extrajudicially contributed a legal dispute over misleading Twitter news in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay per 20 million dollars, and Musk gives up the office of Chairman for three years, a position comparable to that of the German Supervisory Board.
The Chief of Staff must remain against this.
In the comparison, which neither must be confirmed by a court, neither muscle nor Tesla's faulty behavior.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned manager before the U.S. Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, also represented by SpaceX, is the public face of the lost electric car pioneer who is currently rated at the stock exchange with more than 50 billion dollars.
Musk doesn't feel guilty
Musk explained that he did nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed about the complaint.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7th Musk had written his more than 22 million Twitter followers, he might take the company off the stock exchange and pay $420 per share, which is secured funding.
This would have cost Tesla a total of 72 billion dollars.
Later, Musk ran back: Tesla stays at the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla must now find a Chairman from outside, set up two independent board members and also set up a committee to monitor Musk communication.

Recordmaster Manchester United has been rushing deeper into the crisis since 1989 after the worst season.
The team of the controversial coach José Mourinho lost at West Ham United earned with 1:3 (0:2) and stayed with ten points after seven games only in the middle of the table.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to grow before the Champions League match on Tuesday against the FC Valencia.

"Let's Dance" jury Joachim Llambi and Mrs. Ilona separated
Joachim Llambi may have separated himself from his wife Ilona.
The dance expert has become known by the RTL show "Let's Dance".
After 13 years of marriage, Joachim Llambi (54) and his wife Ilona (45) are now separated.
The "Picture on Sunday" (Bezhal content) reports on the separation of the well-known moderator and dance expert in Llambis.
"Our clients have made a clear and friendly separation," said the lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser, according to "BamS".

Polls: 46 percent want no brand until 2021 as chancellor
After the Querells of the past weeks, the GroKo destroys several polls.
The SPD is in a survey behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is seen critically.
Berlin - The AfD has oversold the SPD in the Emnid-Sunnagstrend for the image on Sunday for the first time in the country.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AfD adds a figure of 17 percent, the SPD gives a point in comparison to the previous week and ends at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only get to 27 percent.
This is the deepest value for the Union so far in the Sunday trend.
The greens reach 15 percent, the left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If Sunday were a federal election, the government parties SPD, CDU and CSU would receive only 43% of the votes together, according to Emnid.
Thus, the great coalition has now lost the majority in the question of Sunday at all major research institutes, with the exception of Allensbach.
Government parties are increasing to 43 to 45 per cent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 per cent).
In the 2017 federal election, they received 53.4 percent.
In the other parties, the bandwidth is also large: the AfD, in several polls the second strongest party, is 15 to 18 percent.
Greens reach voting rates from 12.5 to 17 per cent.
The left is on average 10 percent, FDP 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such polls have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down depending on the vote.
But also the retention for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has been significantly reduced since the federal election in 2017.
Currently, only 48 percent of the citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the office, as the Emnid survey on behalf of BamS showed.
Only every second (50 percent) wishes the survey today that the large coalition holds up to the next regular federal election in three years, 41 percent for a new election.
Also in a further survey published on Saturday, there had been significant popularity benefits for brand.
The Germans also assess whether in December Merkel should again apply for the CDU presidency.
47% according to Emnid, 44% compared.
As a result, 64% of Union supporters do not wish for a candidate, 35%.
Aldi extension: Price reduced to love luck
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Anyone who says that in times of Tinder, there are no more romantic acquaintances stories - that should be discussed with Aldi once about canned meat.
Munich - In times of digital "Fastfood Dating" through Tinder and Co., the supermarket radiates almost anachronistic romance as a venue for great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced cane meat, boxer short snacks at the wharf or favorite pudding is still in doubt a better story for the later single children than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app is called less a contact, but rather a slip free stock exchange.
We have dared the test: How do women react, but in the first message they don't go around the hot breeze for long?
This is the amazing result.
The right-wing Hollywood-Lovestory potential has then been when the love of happiness predominates an out-of-the-eye-lost-and-re-found plot.
If the type also registers under the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de with its suppliers, then it sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Consorten - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
Thus, the author of this ad in an unknown Aldi branch is to wish that she would also find her dream husband, with whom she had little time over the "30 percent reduced bio-cute meat".
For her belief in the magic of analog learning, she earned her Happy End à la Hollywood anyway.
Photobeck: 500 covers for a life without bending
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludger School has been participating in the action "Deckel v. Polio - 500Deckle for a life without children's injuries".
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infection caused by polio.
The disease referred to in German as children's lesion leads from lesion appearances to death.
In Germany, polio is considered to be eradicated, but there are three other countries in which the disease occurs worldwide.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can so far only be suppressed by vaccines, as is stated in a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc require rest for Gods
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus have requested an end to the public debate on the form and fitness of Mario Götze.
"We should stop thinking about Mario.
That's not good for the boy.
And that's not good for us," said the giant who was friends with God after the 4:2 victory in Leverkusen at the TV station Sky.
Zorc had already stressed before the game.
For him personally, this is not a simple situation.
Football: Eberl: No harm when negotiating with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl of the Soccer Federalist Borussia Mönchengladbach does not see any danger in a possible extension of the contract with Coach Dieter Hecking.
We have not yet talked about a treaty.
There's no fixed date when we do it.
"But there will certainly be the moment where we sit and talk," Eberl said on Sunday evening in the TV station Sky.
Football: District League: Researchers' appearance of the VfL Volbeck against the SC Altenreheine makes courage
There were moments in this still young season, then Alois Fetsch went to court with his sons.
He gave himself a speech to the coach of the football district attorney VfL Wolbeck, only to step back (in-house) to sing about the lack of performance on the green.
All history.
In the meantime, it is running around the Brandhoveway again.
Baptismal evidence is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in which the past playtime is only too thin on the rise.
Yeah, I'm very happy with the show.
"We narrowed the rooms and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and looked up every single one of them to say "thank you" just for so much opposition against the ambitious guests.
After 26 minutes, the coach had to perform a system change.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it was almost seamless from the 4-4-2 in a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes was waiting in front of the ball.
Volbeck had significantly more parts of the game in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs in front of his ex (17th), the mixed Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
Almost would have thought it when the SCA in minutes 41 twice in person by Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer appeared dangerously before the Volbeck's box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his trade.
After the break, the VfL often took full control.
So 18 meters failed.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes at a Thewes heretic.
With Miles Geske's intervention, Fetsch missed the left side again a fresh cell course.
When old-fashioned Chris Naberbüumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, 18 meters before the guesthouse there was an indirect free pass for the pitchters.
The mob attacked itself and demonstrated its danger to standards.
Westhouses' thing with the right sleep hit down from the left view of the shield - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes left, which should be damn long.
And then this: VfL-Captain Florian Quabeck flew in the 80th minute the leather in the courtroom unfortunately to hand.
Judge Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider could not escape the gift (79.).
Bange minutes had to pass Wolbeck in the final phase, before Geske in the 87th minute from 12 meters yet still had the victory hit on the fist.
Maybe it'd have been too much good.
VfL: Hall - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Hub screws in Kottingbrunn
During the landing, there was an accident at the airport.
The four insets were slightly damaged.
At 2:00 a.m. on Sunday at the airport in Kottingbrunn came to a drama.
During the landing of a helicopter there were turbulences, as the police confirmed against oe24.
The heli was captured by a windbow, pushed to the ground and came to rest side by side.
Police, rescue and firefighting were immediately understood.
With a big offer, the operating forces came to the crash site.
The ÖAMTC notarzthub was also called for caution.
Inset only slightly damaged
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There's only one damage.
The four insets were only slightly injured and were able to go home on their own.
The precise circumstances for the accident have not yet been clarified and the subject matter of the investigations.
According to Firefighter Franz Resperger, it came to a small fire of origin, which could, however, be quickly destroyed again.
Report by the Allbright Foundation: Women remain a rarity in business executives
Thus, only 8 percent of the presidencies on the 1st of September were female, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture", which is officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and submitted to the German Press Agency.
"The companies will have to settle differently, otherwise the international competitors will be drawn over to them," said Founding Director Wiebke Ankersen.
In the United States, Britain or Sweden, only male-occupied management teams - with few exceptions - can no longer be considered.
The remainder makes the German competitors less diverse, innovative and future oriented.
It's another business culture.
The small increase in the share of women among German stock exchanges was also due to positive incentives for medium-sized enterprises (MDax).
Although according to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the presidencies are female.
In the previous year, however, the value was still 3.8%.
In the 30 Dax companies - in the last few years, the women's share was stagnant.
26 women worked in the committees.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit consecutive women again next year - in their own interest," Ankersen said.
The only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signalled that they would continue not to commit themselves to increasing the share of "zero percent" so far.
Another picture is found at the Supervisory Boards: On 1 September there was the women's share of 30.5 percent - 45 women more than 68 men less than a year ago.
"If you recruited as many women for the executives every year, you would have reached 40 percent by 2023," says the report.
Some even make misses: Luxury carts: Which manufacturer deserves most per car?
Well, it's best that Ferrari deserves it.
The Italians take 280,000 euros with each sold Ferrari and make 69,000 euros operating profits.
Big cars, big profits: This slogan still applies - in most cases.
Who amongst the noblemen makes most of the profits per cart.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do luxury manufacturers charge per car they sell?
"Autopapst" and economic professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer have dealt with this question.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made every commercial car 69,000 Euros in the first half of the year - Jaguar Land Rover, however, only about 800 Euros, Tesla and Bentley put a lot of pressure on each car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices from 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and about 3,000 euros before interest and taxes EBIT.

Train to open the 60th abbreviation wine festival
With a fork train, the Foreign Transport Association opened its wine festival session in Abtswind.
For the 60th time, the association sets out the wine festivals, which will be held every Saturday in October at the large festival on the Rehweiler Street.
At the start of the anniversary, those responsible brought the sound of the Wiesenbronn to the fort.
The president of the Association of Foreign Transport, Wolfgang Starz, Mayor of Jürgen Schulz and Princess Lisa Kursawe, welcomed the guests at the already well-known festival. "60 years of organizing something like this - this is a crazy performance for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of it," Starz thanked all the helpers.
Princess Lisa II later appeared symbolically with the guests from the stage.
"It's nice that so many have found the way back to us after the wind has subsided." Later, "The Troglauer" was the mood.
On Sunday, on which the abswinder Churchweih was also celebrated, the association for the occasion of the anniversary had set the drinking price as 60 years ago.
A holiday evening for the 60th wine festival takes place on Friday, October 5, in the guest's house, before a day later in the festival goes into the second round.
In Bonn: Notarztuto power in Taxi
A notary car is heavily damaged next to a road.
In the collision of the vehicle with a taxi, a 27-year-old passenger was killed.
When notaries are called, they should help - even save lives.
Such a rescue trip took place in Bonn a deadly end for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian was injured in the collision of a notary car with a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the notary and their driver were seriously injured, as the police reported.
The 46-year-old driver of the notarztato had a red light on Saturday afternoon with bluelight and Martinshorn.
He then stood on a crossroads with the taxi that drove to Green.
After the collision, the doctor slid against a lamp mast and a tree.
He captured the passant who died in the accident.
Driver of the notary and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and notary driver were seriously injured in their vehicles and had to be released from the operation forces.
The 29-year-old notary could free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another retired notary tried this - however without success.
The three serious injuries were brought to hospitals.
The police, in close agreement with the Bonner State Prosecutor, determine who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we find it uncomfortable
After the blasphemous out of the League Cup, Manchester United is also lost in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United is subject to ManU 1:3. The way of the defeat may yet speak.
The scene was meaningful in the 74th minute, in which the reborn Marco Arnautovic shot the 3:1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had allegedly brought the Red Devils back into play.
As they suspected an offside at the pass of Mark Nobel, all of Manchester's opponents remained, and Arnautovic let the ball go all the time in the world at the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative point of an already far-reaching lack of performance.
It is quite different at the moment at the Uniteds Municipal Manchester City.
The citizens trained by Mourinho's great competitor Pep Guardiola came against Brighton & Hove Albion to an unmistakable 2:0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke the defense line for the home team for the first time.
Sergio Agüero made sure after a good hour and a double pass with the previous torso for securing the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also for jumping to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer table leader
Three days after the 1:2 defeat in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought with Liverpool in the Premier League a 1:1 against Chelsea.
Like the cup-out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in London.
The 27-year-old's hit in the 25th minute remained until the final phase of the only hit of the game.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohammed Salah, barely missed the balance after 70 minutes.
It was better done by Daniel Sturridge in the 89th minute with his Schlenzer.
So after the reds had started with a smooth balance in the week, Chelsea was not to be beaten for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, and then the Blues Liverpool crashed from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London City Clubs celebrated Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) 2:0 victory.
However, the fans of the Gunners who played Granite Xhaka had to wait for a success message from the Hertfordshire County to 81 minutes.
Nine minutes ago, Watford Defender Craig Cathcart filed an entry from Alex Iwobi into his own door, only two minutes later Mesut Özil provided the decision with his third season hit.
Arsenal moved through the fifth victory following Watford and is just behind the big Tottenham rival on rank 5. A strong impression continues to leave Upher Wolferhampton under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The wolves remained unbeatable at 2:0 against Southampton in the League for the fifth time in sequence and were the eighth.
VW core brand missing: Paris car salon in the sign of the Diesel debate
The Paris Automobile Salon takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not a topic and yet generally: The Diesel Canal and the ring about driving bans and refurbishments should not be released by the German Autogroup even at the meeting of the industry in Paris.
At the car salon 2018, they will show their news from next week along with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
Diesel doesn't really matter much anymore.
The possible exchange and refurbishment offers for Diesel owners in Germany, which should be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, however, should be an important issue at least behind the shining scenes of the fair stands.
A great name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have, among other things, their first pure electromodels: the e-tron of the Ingolstadters is to come to the market at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart 2019.
Both were officially presented.
The iNext of BMW will only start in 2021.
At the centre of Paris is the new 3rd.
A total of more than 250 exhibitors are represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car groups, motorcyclists as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are present in their own halls.
The trade fair, which this year celebrates its 120th birthday, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
A million visitors arrived in 2016.
In the severe earthquakes and the following tsunamis, at least 380 people died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first wave had the strength 5.9, the second had the strength 7.4.
Communication and transport connections are damaged, there have been huge damage.
After the bombing, the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds gathered at a party on the beach.
It is feared that the numbers of victims will still go up significantly.
So far, the numbers have only come from Palu.
But many other municipalities are also affected - along the west coast of Sulawesis.
Some 150 bikers celebrate Godly Service in Verdohl
Motorcycle Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service for the motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a help team.
Verdohl - The place before the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorbike drivers on Sunday.
However, the final service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor-pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and is thus responsible for the soul-surgical importance of the PS-strong two-wheel drivers.
Between April and September, the traditional Motorcycle Goddess Service (MoGo) will always take place on the last Sunday of a month at the house Nordhelle.
The end of the season celebrates the bikers traditionally in the Church of Peace in Eveking.
There, about 150 bikers gathered on Sunday to perform anything other than regular service to God.
Already from 10 a.m., the bolides were set up before the church's entrance portal.
First, the biker breakfasts stood on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cakes or even with a delicious currywurst.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were among them.
The sermon was held during the biker service of the priest Dirk Grzegorek.
The singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided for the musical flooring.
"Although the biker prefers the Blues Rock, Valerie Lill prefers poetic-silent tones," said Father Frank Schröder.
This too was certainly a novel in the history of the Motorcycle Goddess Service yesterday.
Humidifier home association celebrates a great feast: After the apple the milk comes
And even on the actual day of action Borisch was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg was also of great interest.
He had his apple press in his pocket and demonstrated his standing viewers step by step the process from mature apple to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the children the field and let them fill the apples in the big drawers.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a finely trimmed mass.
Still, many of the children could not imagine how to get a delicious drink.
However, this important work was also seen this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and covered by nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked a little piece of apple layer for layer.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step of work was no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice went into a large vessel.
However, the farmer had already completed the specialties.
He opened his treasure chest and presented the newest spring white to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchttorf" was accordingly large.
In a warm atmosphere, the parents came to the discussion, while the children were not only able to follow the process of the apple press, but also discovered the built Hüpfburg for themselves.
Also, the Wechttorfer friends of former soldiers engaged in the party and invited some stations to play for a while.
Also in the coming year, the home association will offer an action day.
Then, however, as Gregor stressed Krützkamp, the home will not be in the heart of the spargeldorf of the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also due to the subject: finally, it will go around the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with the fourth season award: "Disgusted situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga descent, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed profession from Hanover 96 and spoke to them boldly.
However, there were many positives at 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at the entrance of Frankfurt.
"It's a fucked-up situation, but you have to get out of there as a team," said 96-foot pro Príncipe Schwegler and pushed after: "It's obviously disappointing, because you always get a lot ahead of yourself."
The further secluded bass for which only Florent Muslija (86.) joined, are with two counters all the way down and are a candidate for retirement in their current constitution.
Leaded by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated the first season home victory.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) reached 46,300 spectators in front of the tower for the DFB-Pocal winner, who anticipated seven points in the middle of the table after the successful general test for the European League game against Lazio Rome.
Croatia's Deputy World Champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive of Hessen and never got into the grip of Hanover's defense.
The storms that followed the WM long showed with its pace and performance, why it is so valuable for the entry.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan loaned by the FC Liverpool was the first time in the early formation of the Frankfurters, which began swinging.
One of Lucas Torró's (17th) headballs that fell on the tower for the first time brought danger.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a searchful position at the last moment of the 96th defense around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced Kevin Wimmer (Rücken) in the short term.
The leadership for the houseowners fell almost compulsorily and entirely deserved.
Filip Kostic picked up the ball after a corner of the prison, Haller extended by head before the door, where Ndicka only needed to keep his foot.
It was the first German match for the French second-rate defense player AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt stayed before the break.
This time Haller fit his storm partner Rebic, who could think through and 96-Torwart Michael Esser didn't leave a chance.
In the middle of the day, Hanover-Coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak image of his Elf and brought two new offensive forces to Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Low Saxons now played something more courageous forward, but burning ideas remained to the end before the connection hit.
The Hessens were much more efficient.
After a short hour, Rebic started a solo and then laid over on De Guzmán, who had to push the ball just into the empty door.
The rest was only for the Frankfurters against overcrowded guests, and Jovic also met a minute before the end.
The Morlaix Square will be the party mile
Würsels Despite cold temperatures, good mood prevailed at the October festival in the city centre.
The Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter created it in front of a million audience when he opened the 185.
Munich Wies's last week with two hits.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy Cross Feast
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross festival on September 14 or Sunday.
The Feast service takes place in the city church, then a procession to the Holy Cross church with the final blessing.
The Holy Cross Church hosts the shot Christ, who comes out of the 30-year war and is supposed to have shot the legend after a Swedish soldier.
Then blood flowed out of the wound.
This led to a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
It is not completed to this day, only the old roof stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Pope Adolf Bühl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
Despite the importance of the Geisinger Ppararei, God’s service was poorly visited.
After the service of God, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing the church part of the Cross Festival ended.
For many years now, the Catholic Church choir has been inviting the Catholic parish to the world part of the festival.
The choir members provided the visitors with warm meals as well as a wide selection of cakes and the weather, a farm.
In the afternoon, the parishioners offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmidt-Segger informed the visitors on behalf of the parishioners about the damage to facade, roof, sandstone works and windows, as well as the upcoming tree measures that will last until next year.
After the furniture had been standing for some time, the damage could be identified more precisely and the individual tenders could be prepared more specifically.
It is certain that the renovation is more expensive than planned, because the damage already existing a few years ago has become larger, but it has also been found more, which has only been possible through the eyes.
Sockwork is completed, before winter is to begin with natural stone work, and one hopes to complete half of these works this year.
Opening: New residence in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Danube-Iller life aid opens up a new home for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
That "a very special house" of its determination will now be handed over in the Münsterblickstraße - all those present agreed at the time of the appointment.
Finally, the 12 wheelchair drivers who have been living in the living room of the Danube-Iller for some time have been referring to the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, floors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas have been taken into account by architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago when the former U.S. Army officer building was put on the test stand for the inhabitants with a mobile phonecap: "The house had come into the years and no longer in the equipment at the right time," Bader said in a retrospective way.
In 2016, the Baggers started to tear down the house.
The new building should be made as friendly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel well, says the architect.
Living aid Danube-Iller opens new home
Around EUR 4.6 million invested in the new building.
The state of Freitat paid 2.4 million euros, the county of Schwaben 450000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction works remained within the planned framework - both time and financial.
He also thanked Jürgen Heinz, the managing director of life assistance.
The spagat between a barrier-free and fire-resistant way has not always been easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and artisans had set up a home with the many standards that would allow the inhabitants to experience freedom of movement even without foreign help.
Similarly, the head of the social administration of the Schwaben district, Gertruder Kreutmayer, said: "The house is focused on the special needs of its inhabitants who need the means to be mobile".
The habit and functionality were well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And further: "The property in this situation is a real accident because it is no longer to be acquired in today's situation".
Overall, the new residence in Münsterblickstraße offers a space of almost 1500 square meters for 30 people with disabilities divided into three housing groups.
Prolz is a life aid business manager Heinz to the eleven full-time forces who are all employed according to tariff.
Germany: Swiss complained differences between East and West
Berlin - Prior to the day of the unity, the Deputy Federal President of the SPD, Manuela Schwesig, has appealed to all the people of the country not to deal with the disadvantage of East German.
There are differences that hurt unity after almost 30 years.
With these differences, we must not be satisfied," said Mecklenburg-Vorpommern's Prime Minister to the "day mirror on Sunday".
The aim should remain to create the same living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans worked on average longer than people in West Germany, but 15 percent less pay.
"I can't explain this to anyone for almost 30 years after the German unity," Schwesig said.
North Korea: Does this stinking dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan-Jaghund is supposed to smooth the streets between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pjöngang made a gift to South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moons' office announced on Sunday, the two dogs reached their recipient on Thursday for about one year.
They then passed the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog feed to facilitate the animals' "integration".
The dogs with the thick white fur, sharp ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural property of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendship was announced by the North at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean Power Commander Kim Jong Un in Pjöngang in mid-September.
The two countries also agreed to join together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympics and to apply together for the award of the 2032 Olympics.
In the course of the mutual approach, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket propulsion.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
For the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated since this year almost ten months, numerous new books have been published, most of which answer this question in the last hundred years.
By contrast, Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director general of the Austrian State Archives, adds Austria's beautiful "Imagebook", which will appear on October 1.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to work - this is the informal motto for today's working week of the Great Coalition.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the chancellor and his ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU have not stated the "return to work" in a manner that has been dubious.
This may have led some artisans, doctors, cashiers and otherwise employed citizens in this country to the legitimate question, which is actually the difference between work and work, but be it there.
If the Federal Government is now so far as to re-engage with its mission - to the government - it should not stop it now with conceptual debates.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually bring something together after the provocations and slanders of the last few weeks will probably be shown on Monday.
In the evening, the heads of the government parties come together to the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel will now call this round regularly to resolve conflicts early; a lesson from all the struggle.
First of all, however, there are once again conflicting issues on the agenda with the Diesel Adjustments and the Trade Migration Act.
CSU Minister of Transport Scheuer wants to make the car group more flexible with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see manufacturers in the obligation to refurbish older diesel.
While an approach has been drawn up in the diesel crisis over the weekend, the Union and the SPD are still far apart in the planned law on migration of professionals.
The SPD calls for a living perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or carry out training.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "rail change" from the asylum system in the labour market.
So there will be another conflict among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not equal and equal to GroKo, but three partners with very different social imagery and priorities.
It's a good fight.
Without dispute, a society that is so diverse, with conflicting interests, does not emerge.
In order to be constructive, however, dispute must not be settled again for party reasons on the question of one's or none's.
It's still about politics, not theater.
The Union and the SPD should fight - but always have the reality of people's lives in mind.
What is feasible and uses many?
With this guide question, both diesel and track change issues can be pragmatically clarified - and so confidence can be regained.
This is especially why the People's Party must fight now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in the Visier
Does the Minister of Labour violate the applicable service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Real day and night" her lawyers had been working on social insurance reform, a surpassing social minister reported on the presentation itself two weeks ago.
At Liste-Pilz-Mandatar Daniela Holzinger, the statement by Beate Hartinger-Small (FPÖ) is surprising - she is now bringing the matter to Parliament through request.
They assume that "the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the use of her team and not to announce any violation of the applicable service law in front of current cameras".
However, they now have questions to "can free Har from any suspicion".
Police are looking for women's bodies on the road
Marxgreen - Long the police did not want to speak.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, on the street between Naila and Bad Steben will be buried.
The route is still blocked in the Marxgreen area until Monday.
Previously, the investigators had used an archaeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old people's bones, together with its leader, was able to limit the relevant place to a few meters in multiple use.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered together with scientists at the Technical University of Munich and the Upper Bavarian Memorial Protection Authority in the area of the said road section.
For more than a year, the Court of Justice and the Criminal Police have been working on the case.
Again and again, a bicycle road was blocked at Marxgrün and was examined with sonar devices because the investigators suspected that the body could have been blocked here during the new construction of the state road 30 years ago.
Colouring powder and eggs: Crawall in Barcelona before the Catalan anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum takes place in Catalonia for the first time.
But before that, there's been a lot of trouble.
The separatists have not forgotten the police effort since autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan Independence Referendum of October 1, 2017, there have been clashes between separatists and the police in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the independence supporters, among other things, by colour powder, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and the Civil Guard.
Some 3,000 police officers of the Police National and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues, who were in use last year at the referendum in the polls as illegally classified.
In an attempt to prevent citizens from voting, violence had also occurred at that time.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of separatists and the central state security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
Some of the approximately 6000 separatists, however, would have tried to break the police chain with violence, and the officers would have thrown away, among other things, color labels and eggs.
Six persons have been arrested, 24 others have been slightly injured, it was called the authorities.
On Monday, for the first time, the independence referendum takes place.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision on the division of the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had forced Catalonia into administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president, Carles Puigdemont, fled to exile to Belgium.
Other politicians also moved abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers of the then regional government and other separatists activists remain in U-capture.
New elections were held in the region in December.
Following the entry of the new Catalan government in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But the new Regional President, Quim Torra, is also responsible for the "right to self-determination" of Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westphalia: Collected advicelessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate torlos
Red-white Ahlen continues to take place.
Even at FC Goodsloh it is only a 0:0-distinction.
The final light and the third was released from 438 spectators in the Heidewald Stadium as a gathered councillessness.
The first half was observable from the entertainment factor arg.
Anyone who wanted to get a beer or a brewery could do this without concern.
There was no danger of passing a torchance, because there was practically no.
First shot after half an hour
Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) torso of the whole party in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle the only true - possibility was that the Achleners were forced to go to a parade after a 32-minute shoot from the prison limit.
Even worse were the hosts.
Their most effective action was in an early change.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be replaced with an injury condition, for which Sinan Aygün came.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the rising long-term.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel, a 18-metre target, almost over the case and after an hour, the goodsmen also appeared offensive for the first time.
After a baller operation by Matthew Wieckowicz, it was fixed.
The recently presented counter about Sinan Aygün "kronte" Nick Flock (62.) with a butt-bought shot into the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Skipmann.
In addition, they performed with a headball by Wieckowić (66.) after an Eckball by former Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA-Interim trainer Angelo Daut responded, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70).
It worked - nothing.
More than optical superiority, thanks to their own initiative, the Achleners failed.
Only in the 91st minute did Cihan Yilmaz have the last chance, but it also brought nothing.
Angelo Daut then tried to strike out the positive: "I like that we played to zero," but unfortunately the zero was also ahead.
"This time we weren't as tragic as we were against wooden wickers, and even though our opponent didn't want to play here," said RW Ahlen's Interim trainer.
Offensive, "placing everything like this" against a team, "just wanted to defend it.
I certainly didn't feel like we could get a opponent," said Daut.
However, as an observer to his suffering, he did not have the feeling that his team could shoot a door.
The idea was too good for that.
Reckenfelder Erdedankmarkt: Luckily there are enough Kreimers
The happy Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Table Publishing Office for which these donations are intended.
The honorary states: "These donations remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky appeared radiantly blue, the space still something empty, but this should still change during the day.
Because, "Here's so nice, so we're here today," said one visitor.
The organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl-Outfit as always with an orderly price of Humor.
For the Brockmann married couple, who should actually be balanced against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer went into the hospital in a short time.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are plenty of creamers.
And the "refund" did not allow itself to be taken up by musically entertaining the ever-increasing visitors.
This was so good that a few folk songs were played later.
"Simply great," Marcel Kreimer was delighted.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to suspend the opening time this time in his timetable.
He is pleased with the many assets with their positions, including mainly associations.
"In fact, there shouldn't be anything like a table," he thanked himself for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek welcomed the use of all those in use at the stands and also included the other parties held in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden town has a colorful stretch - here's what.
Then the maikranz of Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück was taken off with the help of the firearm and brought into the winter quarter.
Many stands have been worked for physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty was everything to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, was created by his decoupler story.
Furniture work, beer lid with rackenfelder motifs and some more he had in the offer.
A specialty was offered by three Countess Immer: "Reckenfelder Honig", led by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buchschlüter.
The latter has a speciality.
Honey cakes in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
That's where the little Elsa had to access again and again, so the cake tasted good.
It is the company that let the visitors stay for long to evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn party.
Blurry with local political message: No successful advertising for skates
In Langerich, unknowns have cast little incentive in order to build a skate system.
In a number of places there are corresponding snowflakes, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police sent a fine for damage to the case.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark for Langerich" are engraved on paintings, including at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, the manager of the hall, reports that after the trade fair on September 19th, an appropriate print was discovered on the advertising label at the climb to the Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message of his time was apparently "only" left with an Edding, they have been able to be removed without any problem.
"A few days later it was there again, this time it exploded," said Rottmann.
He assumes that the appropriate advertising label must be replaced.
A special note is given just this case by calling several large companies from Langerich on the table.
If the skate system is built, its implementation should also be made possible by sponsors.
Promises already exist, Jörg Hesselmann explains from the city section of School, Sport and Culture, without names.
However, it is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the corrupted table.
For years local policy and administration have been dealing with the topic of skates.
After the old LWL clinic had been demolished, after some time the search began for an alternative location.
Finally, the Council spoke largely for the Firearms Park.
This ant was not implemented - too many factors appear to speak against a construction at this place.
At the end of June, a turning point followed.
The members of the Main and Financial Committee now voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School area.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word is the city council.
It is based on a decision this year so that a positive vote could be built in 2019.
The tightness of flight security gets even worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, the German air carriers do not see any signs of improvement in the coming year.
"In this year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm will come," said the head of the aviation security union, Matthias Maas, of the German Press Agency before the Air Force Summit on October 5, Hamburg.
An important reason for the many delays and flight accidents has been the long-known staff note for European aviation insurance, for which there is no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new Lots takes four to five years," said the trade union officer.
Throughout Europe, the market has been empty for well-trained lots.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone, about a hundred people were missing to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas once again criticised the fact that various air transport unions were not invited to the summit.
On Friday, representatives of the Federal Republic of Germany, the countries, aviation security, airlines and airports gather to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional closure and overtime, it will not work without us," said the chief of the GdF, who has many members in the German federal aviation security.
Maas once again made the EU Commission responsible for the Lotsen Egyptians.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 have been too low.
The resulting cost requirements and staff savings for national aviation insurance are now fully in line with the operational business.
Maas urged Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to apply in Brussels for regulations that "do not cut off the air yet".
At present, EU regulations would be in line by 2024 and there would be a fear of further exacerbation.
The EU has been constantly exposed to lobbying by airlines.
"Ryanair Chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues have now harvested exactly what they have been sitting for themselves in recent years," Maas said.
He hopes that the high cost of delays in airlines will lead to a rethinking.
The GdF will only be involved in improving the situation if the German Aviation Safety (DFS) offers a "voice training and future pact", Maas said.
The annual admission of 120 lotteries over the next five years, announced so far, is sufficient to compensate for the old-fashioned lapses.
The necessary staffing is not yet connected.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board agrees for group construction
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously for the plans to rebuild the Group.
In accordance with the will of Thyssenkrupp-Interim Chief Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed chairman of the meeting on Sunday, the crystallizing group is to be divided into two independent companies.
Both companies should have their seat in food and be listed on the stock exchange.
There should be no additional staff reduction beyond the already known reductions in the administration.
After two withdrawals, the control body has only eight heads on the capital side.
Ten representatives of the employees are against it.
However, the final decision is expected to take a major meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is intended to include, among other things, the 50% share of the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business is to be merged with lifts and deliveries.
Barcelona: Violence against Demos by policemen and Catalan independence advocates.
In two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish policemen and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona, there have been violent disputes with many victims.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 policemen from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6,000 independence defenders.
The Catalan police have tried with a large bid to keep the two protests apart.
According to the authorities, however, independence advocates repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
They attacked the officials with paint and throwing.
Range leases were also reported among the participants of the various protests.
According to rescue forces, 24 people were injured.
The police reported that there were six arrests.
Improved skills and respect for colleagues
With their demonstration, the police wanted to honor the colleagues who had held a referendum on independence banned by the Spanish central government in Catalonia almost a year ago.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel that it is unfair for Catalan and Basque police officers to earn much more than they do.
The demonstrators felt as a provocation that the Spanish policemen had demonstrated on average in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan Protestant Manel Perez of the news agency AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they drowned us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearicians who wanted to name only with Daniel showed the rejection.
"Of course we want to support our comrades who did only their duty last year: to defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is for us to exercise our rights and we do it in Barcelona because this is a great European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues "did not come to provoke," the police officer said.
Panne allowed access to personal data of British Minister
A security leak at a mobile app has led to the temporary access of the personal data of ministers and MPs of the conservative British Tory Party on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknowns after the Panne was known one day before the Tory party in Birmingham.

Football: Juve-Trainer praises to top: Ronaldos best game
The Portuguese Star Storm has "played the best game this evening together with the half hour of Valencia", Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri praised after the 3:1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensively purchased star was also without its own gate the decisive man in the important party against the pursuer.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and made it good," said Allegri.
Even though we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good at our first door - and from the moment we grew up.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three torso templates, Juve turned the game after the early retreat by the hit of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and hung the worst pursuer first.
The Torjager from Real Madrid first introduced Mario Mandzukic to the former Federal Professor Mario Mandzukic, who provided a double pack (26/49.) for the management.
And Ronaldo also performed the preparation for the meet-up of the Head of Defense, Leonardo Bonucci (76), who had to move shortly before the torline.
"There are many templates," the coach praised.
But of course, Allegri also wants to see towers by the attacker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of the record shoots.
"We need to get even better at serving him," the coach demanded.
Best Juve-Torschützze is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the overpower of Juventus seems to become even more oppressive.
Seven wins in seven games is the free series in the series A. At 21 points the master of the remaining seven years has already six meters leading to Naples.
The table range, trained by former Bayer-Coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without chance against Turin.
But not later than the place referenced by Mario Rui (58.) the leading party was decided.
The Portuguese had to climb too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow red from the square.
"We have played well against a good Naples," said the Turin Coach.
The defendant was also allowed to feel Emre Can.
The German national player went through with Juve.
The professional who came from FC Liverpool was employed by all seven league parties.
The middle field doctor also played in the Champions League Party against Valencia, which Allegri meant with the "half an hour": Ronaldo was flying out of the square at the 2:0 victory of the Turiners and was locked up for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes its name
With a particularly scrupulous performance, Rapper Kanye West has provided attention at the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" at the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume provided guidance and questions to the viewers.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change to publish his new album on time.
For the time being, you can only call him "Ye," says the musician.
"The being that was once known as Kanye West," he tweeted on behalf of the deceased singer Prince, when he offered his artist names.
However, the pseudonym is not new.
The 10th album has already been released under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had explained that "Ye" had religious significance for him.
"I believe "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "you", says the rapper.
Football: Round A1 Münster: Final!
Done!
Hoetmars Trainer Averhage did not heal from his disappointment.
That was a weak game of us today.
The opponent was just more aggressive, we have put him as well as never before in trouble." According to thin, the list of Hoetmar's options is read.
Grades once two torso opportunities in 90 minutes so that only rare games can be positive.
Football circuit A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG transmitter with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
In the first run, the SG also had only two options, the first but used Maik Krause from the top angle for early driving (7.).
In the 43th minute, Steffen could have increased Uphus, but after great preparation of Krause he explained himself freely.
The hosts had only a double chance when Moritz Höne first crashed at Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and also found his master in the postcaster Jan Blome.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good opportunities.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61.) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) gave everything.
A trade-meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved on the torline by hand and saw Red for it - also Niklas Eilmann could not use for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide scored the ball over the line, the party was decided (81.).
"We had been strongly criticized before, and that was different today than in the last few weeks," said Florian Kraus.
Sendhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, May, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Tower: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheid (81.).

Football: Circle A2 Münster: Spectacle football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't even know what to like about it," he says.
"We didn't even get access to it." He probably meant the flying songs with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green whites that came up with a collective offensive.
However, he could laugh: "A fucking victory," he said, shuddered, and drew from there his players to notice the relief that they had drawn out of the affair with three points.
Well noted, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely Albacht, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for the class.
With understandable mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
"It was our best seasonal performance at a distance," he says.
"As we returned after the 0:2, as we opposed one of the top teams of the League all the time, that was really phenomenal."
The more bitter it is that you have to go home with empty hands.
The host was led by the top-tourrier Lars Zymner with his 12th season meeting (24.).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this door.
He placed the 2:0 on the left side for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but such a player can't keep up.
"It was already crazy what he did," Lewandowski recognized the enemy's quality.
Shortly before the change of the page, his own Elf managed to make up for it: McGill's left-wing freistoß sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia-Torhüter Hinkerohe across to the long thoreck (45.).
After the change, it was McGill again who achieved the compensation (59.).
Then it went on and on.
It was a tricky, action-filled game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64.), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann (69.).
Despite excessive numbers, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia hit (80.) again.
We now have to focus our full concentration on Wednesday.
"The game against sheep farmers, that's what we need to win now," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolf, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bone (87. Barexai).
Towers: 1:0 Zymner (24th), 2:0 Frying (39th), 2:1 McGill (45th), 2:2 McGill (59th), 3:2 Nubel (64th), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69th), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80th).

Football: TSV Straßberg Fights Point Against Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga duell between the TSV Straßberg and the FV Biberach.
The table guide was actually affected by three points, however the team of Coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and at the end the game ended 0:0.
Media: The entire Bureau of Dynamo Dresden declined
The entire Bureau of football secondaryist Dynamo Dresden has reportedly declined.
Several media filed a joint letter from the Sachsen Board in the evening.
First of all, there was no confirmation of the association.
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal power struggles with the former Federal List.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
Good thing he's gone again.
There are only a few state guests whose departures in Germany provide as much relief as those of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Three days was the guest of the Turkish President in Berlin and Cologne, and many thought he should not have been invited.
Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 meetings by the middle of next year.
This is why French President Emmanuel Macron has signalled that he wants to collect the tolerance price personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President he was not in Tutzings Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wolff was there for guests.
So he was counted by the head of the Academy Udo Hahn, when he proudly said, "All the presidents and Chancellors were already with us." That at the Academy in Tutzing Castle there were still prominent appearances, but there was also a theme in the presentation of the annual program.
At the end of October, Singermaker Konstantin Wecker participates in a meeting on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective, on 29 September the writer Frido Mann is at a meeting on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has also promised: He wants to take personally the "tolerance award" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which he also receives in another category by television moderator Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings by mid- 2019 have it in them.
"The rent is not safe!" is in a meeting title.
"SOS at the borders of Europe" - the Academy describes the "risking and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And at a meeting about Syria: "Barbarai without limit."
Weapons, destruction, torture, death - the war increases every human idea".
From structural racism in society over the scarcity between arm and kingdom to the radical change in work through digitisation, the spectrum is sufficient.
Academie Director Hahn was convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least for partial solutions".
At a meeting of 200.
Karl Marx's birthday will soon be expecting a more visitor from the direction of capitalism criticism, the others rather a trend "from left to middle".
What does it look like with neutrality?
"We are, in fact, 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical Church of the Land," said student director Dr. Ulrike Haerentl, "so we are not 100 percent neutral".
Music Cabaret: Gender understanding with heart - Volbeck - Westfälische News
Both for adults and for men, the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner was on the Friday evening in the hall of the Christchurch in Volbeck.
As a cabaretist, Teubner presented himself to the gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth for the (sympathetic) woman and (sympathetic) man and what else there might be, but also with music.
The mini guitar used it and also mastered its violin.
On the wing was Ben Sürkrup.
He is a true pianist, one of the male locksmiths, who also comes to the end of the sentence, the other one so congenially accompanied by Süvkrüp Tiebner, that some may have wanted a solo.
It was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but otherwise, the way it fits the red thread of the evening.
There Tebunner had brought into play a paradoxon: The satisfaction of the man comes when he has a partner, but this does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner does not bring any benefits.
The piano solo now demonstrates itself: What would come from the composition of Mozart, would "the Nannerl" have opened the door unexpectedly?
This is how Sufkrup moves on in improvisations, from Bach's "O Head Full of Blood and Wounds" to the "Song of Death", and from Mozart g-Moll-Symphonie into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
The flowers were handed over by Karlheinz Kleintje, the treasurer of the association, the cansonette.
However, the president of Heidemarie Markenbeck was not allowed to take any additional thanks.
She also had the idea of giving the duo in addition to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt one in Volbeck.

The French bus driver stayed for a night in the hospital for observation.
He will be released in the course of the day, said a police spokesperson.

Handball: Women-Landesliga: Ahlener SG saves against TV Wattenscheid near the white west
The Achlen women had problems, especially with the third-party player Caroline Stallmann, who had only ten hits.
"In fact, I was happy with the defense, only one player made too many doors.
We didn't get them in the grip," says ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more upset about the many opportunities he had left behind.
Finally, the concentration left his team missing this time.
So the ASG almost went back to the end of a retreat, was on the break with 11:12 and later with 15:18 (45.).
Only by the end did the larger bank of the hosts become decisive.
In addition, Aydogdu put Merle Clement's back space on the left-hand side, which then made "extremely clever the decisive tower" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Clement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3. League Women: Topping the BSV Eastern Beaver at the top of the VC Allbau Food
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyballers of the BSV East Bevern have re-established themselves in the top group of the 3rd Liga West.
At the second-degree VC Albau Food, the blue whites won with 3:1.
"That was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play with the top third of the league.
This is what we have done now," Coach Dominik Munich was pleased to see his team's almost without a record in the crashing table guide.
The first pass dominated the guests almost according to their preferences.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went with 25:15 to the vice-presidents of the previous year.
Food has been accepted in the double line, but has not come into play.
We've done them a good job.
Our opponent has hit high risk, but also produced several driving cards.
In the second sentence, the BSV already led by 12:8. "Food has changed the acceptance into three rows.
We couldn't hold the pressure.
Eating's got a lot of fun, and we've got a little bit of fun," Munich continues.
At 18:17, for the first time, the volleyballers from the rudder area had the nose.
Although at 19:24, East Bevern refused four more bets, the fifth attempt found his goal.
"The game was now a better class," the coach was at the rising level.
Mike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the BSV's turning the sheet in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Munich: "There we have played consistently and quietly".
Over 7:3 and 15:13 the blue-white passed four with 25:22 on their side.
Vera Horstmann was chosen as the most valuable player, but Maren Flashmeier also had a privileged day.
BSV women: Egg house, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flashmeier, Mersch Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish municipality: Moscow opening as missed chance
The Turkish municipality in Germany (TGD) has criticised the way in which the large ditib mosque in Cologne was dedicated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The mosque opening in Cologne has left in the German-Turkish relationship a sharp edge that can only be reversed with difficulty," said TGD President Gökay Sofuoglu, the German editorial network.
Both the Turkish and the German sides would have missed the chance of a common, peaceful appearance.
"Statt side-by-side with German top politicians to emphasize the membership of Muslims to Germany, Erdogan used the date for his purposes," Sofuoglu complained.
The widespread exclusion of the German public has "strengthened many reservations".
Home club Nottuln: Offer has already been established
After the long summer break, there is finally a folk meeting time.
On 18 October ( Thursday) at 7.30 p.m., the home club Notuln is already holding its fifth Nottuln People's Meeting in the fireplace of the Old Office.
Just on the day it's almost a year ago that we've had a folk meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become a permanent part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln," says Hanns Moormann, president of the Nottulner Heimat Association.
I wouldn't have thought of our meeting so quickly in Notuln eta.
Whether the stormy friederike in January or the heat wave in July, the fireplace of the office was always full.
"The program at the next folk meeting is as always a colourful mix of German folk, hiking and seaman songs, folk songs, evergreens and old drummers," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who is always invited to Nottuln by his friends.
Klaus Spellmeyer agreed with his accordion on the first "Birthday" folk event.
He was a member of Gaitling, a group from the neighbouring district of Steinfurt, who played music with German texts.
Now he's on his way with an Irish folk band.
The creators of the People's Meeting remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz of the Emsdetten People's Meeting, with his international version of the song "Frösche in the Night" thrilled the listeners and sent them home with a noise.
"We count with many happy guests to once again spend a pleasant and humorous evening," it says in the invitation of the home association.
Whoever plays an instrument and wants to actively participate is invited to join.
Since the desired seats are always quickly covered, it is recommended to be there in time.
The meeting begins at 7.30 p.m., but the opening is already at 19.00 p.m.
China approved planned merger of Linde and Praxair

FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step on the way to the world's largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese Competition Authority approved the proposed merger, Linde announced on Sunday.

For legal reasons, all open questions must be clarified by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit-building to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stamberger Hall, the 125-year-old existence of the Association for Gardening and Landing was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit show at the Kulbacher Verinshaus, the last foundational impulses were set for the Kulmbach Association for Gardenbuilding and Landespflege Kulmach, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a great jubilee in the Kulbacher Stadthalle on Saturday evening.
In 1893 he was removed from the baptism by the mayor Wilhelm Flessa.
Even the purpose of the fruit-building shop was different from today's work - it was actually about fruit-making, about flowers and gardening at the time nobody thought about it.
"At that time, in the era of enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," said circuit home nurse Günter Dippold in his speech.
Fruit trees should go off roads, so-called industrial gardens have been built in schools.
The site is still the task of the 55 garden building associations in the district of Kulmbach, which include almost 7,000 members.
But that doesn't make the spectrum far-reaching.
Natural gardening, organic plant protection, village decoration and nutrition play an equally important role as well as the mediating of knowledge, healthy nutrition and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorfer Jugendgruppe "Maulwurfe" on the stage show how diverse the areas of a garden building are.
"Youth work is especially urgent in the digital age," said the circuit president Günter Reif, and also OB Henry Schramm stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
The Kastanian collection was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can gather much joy with smartphone & co..
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where are they to stand," added Landrad Söllner, and highlighted the special importance of garden building associations for the villages.
The association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and greenery in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of many gardening associations in the countryside also left no doubt about it by circuit managers and expert advisor Friedhelm Haun.
He led the many visitors with a photo presentation through the long history of the circle association and reported, among other things, the need for self-sustainment after the war.
Previously, everything came out of the garden, for which it was ingested in winter.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the utility garden became a zoo and living garden.
"Natural has existed, it was already there before us and we must guide ourselves to it," the expert called for fruit and nut trees.
Therefore, there is the urge for the garden builders not to leave behind so that our home remains beautiful and valuable.
It also includes welcoming the new citizens in our associations, complemented by the President of the Bavarian Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We must stop the brilliant decline in insects, which we owe our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful festival, which was celebrated by the music club's musicians.

Priority on Nafta talks: Canadian Foreign Minister Submits UN Speech
Mexico's government wants clarity in Nafta matters: you are setting an ultimatum for an agreement between the two trading partners.
The Canadian Foreign Minister now gives the Trade Agreement an absolute priority - and moves its speech to the United Nations.
Because of the time pressure at the ring for a recast of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the United States and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has moved her speech to the UN General debate in New York.
Instead of this Saturday, the minister will speak only on Monday before the United Nations Full Assembly, her spokesman Adam Austen told her.
In the meantime, they focus on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo stated on Friday that the negotiations leaders of Canada and the United States had 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to enter into the trade agreement already reached between his country and the United States.
In August the United States and Mexico agreed to a recast of the Regional Free Trade Agreement Nafta.
US President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
Talking about a new edition has been going on for over a year.
By Sunday evening (location time) they are to be brought to a conclusion, Trump's government intends to submit the agreement to the US Senate before 1 October.
In the event of a failure in the negotiations, Mexico's appointed President, Andres Manuel López Obrador, had announced on Friday that he would try to reach a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate, Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a knife attack, left the hospital.
The right-wing ex-military wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, where he lives, after a report from the newspaper "O Globo".
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old in the last week before the presidential elections in the South American country will see public performances.
At the beginning of September, the politician was attacked on the open road during an election event in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people went to the streets in several Brazilian cities to protest against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele no" (in German: "He doesn't"), women's associations had especially called for protests against the former military.
In the social networks too, the associations made racist and derogatory statements against Bolsonaro.
In the São Paulo economic metropolis, thousands of demonstrators were expected.
In the capital of Brazil, the protests mixed with an announcement of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT) presidential candidate Fernando Haddad.
He joined the post of former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and therefore must not run.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
As the former mayor of the Millionaire City of São Paulo, Haddad was still far behind the right-wing candidate Bolsonaro.
Although the "Trump Brasiliens" has been involved in political activity for a long time, it presents itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates in the first round reaches the absolute majority, there will be an election on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro is not going to come out of this successfully - no matter who he is against.
Bolsonaro is known for his hatred of homosexuals and blacks and for his achievements in military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He's always shocked with verbal detachments.
Another time he said that Lula's followers should be shot to the left.

After a long illness: Danish rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen shared on Larsen's website.
At death, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been in treatment since the beginning of the year for prostate cancer.
Larsen had become known as the band Gasolin, which was extremely successful in the 1970s in Scandinavia.
Their songs were influenced by international music sizes such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
In 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million plates in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om Natten" is the most sold album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Löcke Rasmussen praised Larsen on Sunday in a statement as "street boys", which "against everything, but was in all hearts".
The chief of government also recalled that the monarchies-Register Larsen acted on the 70th birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rock night in the shoe factory: Volume at pressure level
"Here we stand, take the bones and turn on a concert day with the strength of a tiger." Only the band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonsaw" and "The Ignition" put such a rewriting of the rock live music experience on Saturday night in the room of the Civic Center shoe factory: Hardrock pur from three other friends.
After the sound check and shortly before the beginning of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There's no trace of lamp fever.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding region – all in association with the Booking Agency "Mosquito" from Oelde – are thrilled to see with their bands the approximately 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" Rock Night.
The Quartet "Tiger Bonsaw" with Frontmann and Guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to start the concert even with the latest, unknown pieces from their own springs and the next CD.
In front of the stage, the band is danced at the performance for the vocal and pressureful interaction of the band.
Even though the "Tiger Bonsaw" calls are not to be missed, "Tiger Bonsaw" then leave the stage to the trio "Here We Stand".
That hardrock is not the same hardrock, guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich at the bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate with their alternative, occasional sounds of classical rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", "Here We Stand" is also used as a guitar rock synthesizer.
Not only is it the sighty, just-ballading "Take Me Home" that comes through the change of melodic passages to the guitar-laughing rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
The Quartet "The Ignition" from Tonnishausen has since its founding in 2005 had a special degree of familiarity.
Full of agility, the band presents its hardrock on Saturday.
The "The Ignition" with its performances in front of the large audience - recently documented in a movie by Max Meis about the 2017 tour in China - is obvious and unparalleled.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann, in collaboration with the band, also places his own accents on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
To this end, the guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers even higher-powered sound than before, during which he runs through the audience.
Of course, a certain volume of sound belongs to such a hardrock concert: At Mint Mosquito's Rock Night, the three-star concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonsaw" and "The Ignition" is heard by the mixed suit team at about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the level of the press airthammer, but it is still clearly under the control of the "wacken-fesitval", the "Ignition" on their website.
The deaf deafening 120 decibels in Düsenriglautsten as usual at the annual metal-steel diein in the north of the Republic, however, the Ahlener audience does not need this night of rock.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the toughest rock gangart have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso game and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bones and burned a concert taboo with the power of a tiger," all three groups, freely in the transferred sense, can say at the end.
And especially enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

A fatal accident at Essen/Mülheim Airport
At Mülheim/Essen Airport there was a fatal accident.
On a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen airport, a sailing plane crashed on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
Near Mülheim/Essen Airport there was a fatal accident on Sunday.
As reported by the "West German General Newspaper", a sailing aircraft was crashed at the fairground at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the pilot was alone on board - with the pilot it was intended to be an intruder.
By the time of the accident, the plane was on its way to land.
The crash site is just near a fortress on the airport.
But there's been an October party since this weekend.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located on the town border of the two Ruhrbeitsvad cities and directly on the drive to the motorway 52.
From the parking lot there is a park&Ride offer at large events in the Messe Essen or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
"And then we fell in love"
The fact that the President of North Korea Power Kim has been perfectly well-informed despite the nuclear crisis is not a secret.
Now Trump has made his colleague a regular declaration of love.
It also has to do with Kim's "beautiful letters".
At the tender age of 72, the married president of the United States became known as a new flame.
The Tragic: It's a remote relationship.
In all the public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean Power Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
Before supporters of the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-year-old Sprosis of the Pyongyang Governor's Dynasty, even though he is proving himself in the ring around North Korea's nuclear armor as a rather narrow fracture.
"I was smart, he was also, and it went between us and here," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only would the conversations with Kim have made his heart melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection also bore political fruit: Trump referred to the stop of all atomic and rocket tests announced by Kim, even though critics have so far seen little more than lip recognition.
That the affection for the "Rocket Man" - so Trump's name for Kim - should not be more important to everyone, seemed to the US president to be quite conscious.
Anyway, he took the criticism he expected when he appeared in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling immediately before: "Donald Trump says they have fallen in love".
How terrible, how terrible is that?
This is so unpresiding.
But it cared very little for him, Trump explained and directed his finger to the number of people: "I always told you it was so easy to be president".
But then we wouldn't push 10,000 people out there into this washed-up arena, but we'd only have 200 people out there.
Octoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler best visited, moody and above-dwelled by the sun: very varied and with a good shot Octoberfestflair poured out Baesweiler's city centre on Sunday.
For the first time, the October festival took place not only in the fortress at the fire tower, but was extended from the trade union on Sunday to the city.
Refugees thanks to video saved from Libyan prison
With the help of a mobile video, Nigerian refugees have pointed to their catastrophic prison conditions in Libya and thus have enabled their salvation.
The group had rotated the recording in its cell in the coastal town of Savija in July under life-threatening and spread online.
"They refuse to send us back," said one man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alarmed the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
Finally, the refugees fled to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we probably wouldn't have been able to return to Nigeria," said Efef Onyeka, who had recorded the video, the AFP News Agency.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya while trying to get across the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video, he took a life-threatening approach to his own statement.
One of his rivals was almost beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the conditions of detention have been catastrophic: "They all beat us with pipes and pieces."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrines.
The IOM organises the voluntary return of refugees who have been beached in Libya.
Some 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homes this year using the program, said IOM spokesperson in West Africa, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the Nigerians now rescued is not exceptional in view of the bad conditions in Libya.
But he hasn't heard from a cell phone help video yet.
International organisations have been criticising the situation in Libyan refugee camps for a long time.
The North African State, which is dominated to a large extent by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the People’s School on Sunday afternoon to prepare her teaching for Monday, she surprised a breaker.
At 4:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building over the main entrance.
In front of the 1st floor, she saw a man running away.
Only through a door, then through the roof terrace and from there through a ladder into the ground or the front seat.
The teacher understood the police who took the investigation.
Whether things or money have been stolen can't be said yet.
Action description: about 16 years old, black, quite short hair, slightly darker look, dark pants, dark T-shirt.

Germaner was caught in his own car for days
A 75-year-old has had to spend several days and nights in his car in a forest area in medieval France after he had fixed the car outside all the forest roads and blocked the car door.
Rescue forces discovered the car on Saturday afternoon by accident, and released the missing persons since Sunday night, the police reported on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was reportedly in spite of the cold nights and the long time without care in good health.
He agreed to look forward to his home now.
The pensioner was reported missing from his family after he had not returned on Tuesday from a trip with his land car over the local meadows and fields.
Despite intensive search measures, the man’s remains remained unclear for days.
Laschet recalls rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) advised the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to rule of law in Turkey according to his own statements.
The relations of the two countries were currently "overshade", Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This concerns, in particular, detention, press freedom and freedom of religion.
He has therefore made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to be normalised in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that rule of law is a very important condition for them".
Laschet also reportedly referred to the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of opinion should be respected.
Erdogan then again stressed the independence of Turkish justice.
The conversation of Laschet and Erdogan was shortly moved into a building of the Federal Ministry of Defence's flight readiness at Cologne Airport.
Originally, it was supposed to take place at Castle Vahn - but the castle owners had refused to do so out of political conviction against Erdogan.
Erdogan continued to open the Ditib mosque in Cologne after the conversation.
Laschet had canceled a joint performance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contact partners - not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the United States: North Korea is demanding for disarmament
While US President Trump will not be tired of stressing the success of the negotiations on North Korea's denuclearisation, the osteostia regime is the most accurate.
Foreign Minister Ri is calling for a meeting of Washington.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has proposed to the US government in the UN General debate to block negotiations for an nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula with its continued sanctions.
"The latest state of silence is therefore that the US builds on forced measures that are deadly to confidence-building," said Ri in New York.
In these circumstances, equipment is indispensable for North Korea.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there will be no way that we will disarm ourselves as the first person," said the North Korean Chief Diplomat.
The fact that North Korea's criminal measures could "force the knee" is "a dream of people who don't know us".
In order to build trust, however, his country stopped its nuclear and rocket tests and destroyed an atomic test plant, Ri pointed out.
On the US side, however, there were no "appropriate reactions", the minister criticised.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile programme, the UN Security Council had decided three times last year only to impose sanctions on the international isolated country.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo have in recent days urged the United Nations to strictly adhere to criminal measures.
At the same time, the US government is working towards an approach.
In June, Trump met for the first time North Korea Power Commander Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the President of the United States is seeking a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to resume talks on the end of the North Korean nuclear programme to Pjöngang.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the municipality
That they were actually in a youth meeting, many of the visitors of the house of the open door HoT got nothing with: white ceilings and flower decoration on the tables and a large buffet were waiting for the guests after the harvest service.
The young people of the HoT had been fascinated by the buffet with deliciouss from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to thank themselves for the food.
It was not easy to start with the new facility, as Henriette Westbuer, the director of the HoT, remembers.
We had filled our refrigerators already before the summer break wash with food and ingredients and were best prepared on the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break came the evil surprise: a power failure had placed the huge, two-part refrigerator out of operation, the food was ruined and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start from the front: although we got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, the children and young people wanted to create it alone," says Westbuer.
And that's how they all packed up.
The result could be seen that the guests were excited.
"Better it can't even cook," said one visitor impressed, while hokkaido soup was served or guests could serve Quiche, liver cheese or cakes.
"It's really great what the kids and young people have put on their legs," said Father Frank Beckmann, while Magician Stephan Lamben with cartoon tricks and other pieces of art provided for surprises.
Jürgen Sator leaves the National Board of Directors NRW of the Table
From scratch on criticism from its own ranks, the head of the Essene Table, Jörg Sartor, has given up his posts in the National Association.
Sartor had become known throughout the country because the Essen table had introduced a stopover for foreigners.
He had already retired in July as vice-president of the NRW tables, said Sartor of the "World on Sunday".
I like too many of them in my back.
The head of the Tablen Landesförbeits NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed his understanding of the decision of his long-term deputy.
The sharp criticism has taken Sartor.
"I can follow his steps - people who didn't know exactly why the dining table did it."
But Sartor is still active for the Essen table - "six days a week, then nothing changes", says Weilerswist.
Sartor criticised colleagues of other tables in the "world on Sunday" again.
You must not pursue the approach, "without us hungering the people in the city".
It is the task of the State to ensure that people did not starve.
At a conference of the tables on Friday in Berlin, the Essenes did not take part.
"That's where I'm told too much sweetness," he said.
There are all these social confusions that have criticised me at that time.
Play SF Lorch 2:0 Leadership - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, district Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after stay - Bettingen beats Lauchheim clearly.
With 2:0 Lorch in the home game against the Neuler TV - at the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment with the sports friends was great.
Quite different from the TV Heuchlingen: In Kirchheim the TVh ran fast with 0:1 in the back meeting, but after 90 minutes he won with 2:1 at the top of the table, the SGB was able to do so with a 3:0
Gladbach plays double leadership - Shack without embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach must continue to wait for an outdoor match in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2 the foals play a lead twice.
Schalke comes against Mainz for the first season victory (1:0).
(sda) Four times Schalke has manipulated himself in the first five league games with early opponents away.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco put back that strength on the day that it had placed the first place behind the Bavarians in the last season.
Alessandro Schöpf led the home team in the eleventh minute after a strong preparation by Jewgeni Konopljanka per head, thus preserving the mini-polster with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund welcomes you again from the top of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre had dealt with Bayer Leverkusen until the break of 0:2-back stand, however, in the second half of the season it still reached 4:2-victim.
Jacob-Brubun Larsen (65th) and Marco Reus (69th) are equal to a double in four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63th minute, provided with another double in the final phase (86th/94) for the crowning end of the performance increase after the break.
The VfB Stuttgart also won the first victory.
On the other hand, because of a yellow-red map against Milos Veljkovic, even before the break, Bremen had to fear the Stuttgarts temporarily.
Borna Sosa and the unattainable Goalie Ron-Robert Objectivers manufactured a curious throw-in property that helped the guests in the 68th minute to compensate.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to his first victory.
In Wolfsburg Michael Lang did not experience complete happiness, but neither did he miss debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The gladiators present with the Swiss Quartet Yann Summer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang gave a two-time lead out of hand, played 2:2 and are still waiting for an outdoor victory in the VW city since 2003.
For Wolfsburg's compensation for 1:1, Renato Steffen was responsible for his second federal leaguer.
At the 20-metre flash shot of the Aargauer, Yann Summer was powerless, just as at the second match after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa is seen as a goalgetter in the storm of the foals.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchase by OGC Nice took place for the third time and for the seventh time in the seventh game.
After seven rounds Gladbach takes the fourth place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeatable Werder Bremen acted against the VfB Stuttgart in an uncomfortable position.
After 19 minutes, Florian Kohlfeldt's team was surprised by a Stuttgart counter that ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis ended with his first season hit, and after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic added to his team: The 23-year-old Serb was after a trinket victim against Daniel Didavi Yellow Red.
Although Stuttgart Defendor Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert targeted the Bremer by a certain throw-in owner (68.) back into the game, a quarter-hour before closing, Gonzalo Castro shot the over-numbering Stuttgarter back to the victory street.
Nuremberg decided the duel against Düsseldorf 3:0 sovereignly for itself.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens already took the home team through Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new names
In Macedonia, about 1.8 million citizens today agree on whether to change the name of their country in northern Macedonia.
In the case of a yes, the nearly three decades-long conflict with the neighbor of Greece could be resolved.
Athens had survived a name change due to its same northern province and blocked every approach to Macedonia to the west.
The voters therefore also decide on future Western integration.
The US had announced that the country could soon become a NATO member at a positive outcome of the referendum.
Acids in U-Haft.
Refugee attacked three women.
One Syrians brutally harassed three pensioners and injured them in part.
The 41-year-old asylum advertiser randled in Alsergund on Friday at 22 o'clock.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who had thrown his fists on passersby and tried to attack them, on his behavior.
Then the Syrians tried to beat the officials and step in.
A few days later, the suspect appeared to have hit three elderly women (65, 67, 75) with his fists to the ground in the Märinger Straße.
In addition, he had joined the trio with his feet.
The pensioners were partly severely injured.
You suffer from haematoma, seizures and brain failure.
The asylum-seeker was "out of unknown cause", as the police said, was also severely injured.
He was taken to the hospital and continuously monitored during treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost a year after the entry into force of marriage for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday, the two of them gave themselves the Jaword in Hamburg.
If a registered life partnership had not been compromised for them, Kahrs had previously said the "image" session.
"If we're married, then right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahr is the budgetary speaker of the SPD Federal Day Group and one of the speakers of the Seeheim Circle, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of the marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had made an Opinion on 30 June 2017.
He had thus proposed to the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to have "stowed" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in anticipation of the alleged announcement of the DDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
They had been able to enter their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as adoption law.
Garden day: 400 meters hectic cut
There was a lot of work ahead of the members of the Citizens' Association Children's House and the Leprakunde Society.
Because about 400 meters of hedges should be cut around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfrunnerhaus.
Supported by the inhabitants, it went to work for about 12 supporters.
"We do this to reduce costs," said the president of the Civil Society Walter Schröer.
And there's been a lot of this.
Because of the hot summer we are late this time, but luckily it's just a cut.
Because already in the spring, you've scored the hedge once.
This always follows the work of breakfast, too, has a long tradition.
"It's supposed to stay with all the forces," Walter Schröer said.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner gets gold at the Canuslalom-WM
The Augsburger Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the end of the Canuslalom World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old placed a perfect course on Sunday on the Olympia track.
Two years ago he had missed Olympia bronze by three hundredths.
I was well prepared, had enough rides here at the plant, and it's all right today," said the 2012 London Olympics third.
In order to achieve his goal, he threw his paddle before joy and reached the height of both arms victoriously - of course, it would suffice for at least one medal.
Anyway, you had your start number four.
However, the six remaining launchers could not last 89.69 seconds.
The second was the Czech Jiri Prskavec before the Russian Pawel Eggel.
The police inspection Gauting mentions the first attempt to break into a single-family house this fall.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days will be shorter - this is what breakers want to make use of again.
So the police inspector Gauting mentioned yesterday the first attempt to break into this autumn.
The fact that it was left at the single-family house on the Kingsweiser Street is due to the alarm.
That was when the criminals laid their hands on Friday just 20 hours ago.
The intruders, however, believed that the residents were not at home.
However, the alarm was apparently surprised by the fact that they escaped without help.

Pleite at Hertha: Collected from reality: Bayern v. Ajax
The predicate is unbeatable: The defeat in Berlin does not want to "like the FC Bayern".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first intermediate phase of Niko Kovac's term of office.
The first small part of the performance under the new Coach Niko Kovac is not to increase to the greater autumn depth for the Munichers.
"One week ago you still had the impression that we are invincible.
Now we got a little bit of reality," Thomas Müller noted after the merit of 0:2-down at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League Duell with Ajax Amsterdam.
Who knows us, who knows that this really upsets us, and that's why we're giving Tuesday gas.
For the first time since more than a year outside, no own gate was shot, like at the same time of the pre-season two duties in series without victory, the table management in the football Bundesliga lost first to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as the end phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the recordmaster must be alert.
The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its running man versus man tactics and the Berliners, through their playful needle stick across the outside, have delivered within three days the same two blouses, as the last too powerful Bavarians are to knock.
"Those who know the FC Bayern know that we don't like it and we will do everything we can to be successful again," Kovac stressed.
Otherwise, however, he and his lossers in his hometown changed surprisingly gently and pushed his first defeat as a Munich Coach only on the once again lack of opportunity.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would still make the first intermediate phase of his term of office a positive one before the country's break - otherwise the sound would probably get worse.
In this way, Kovac did not take exceptional measures prior to the second king-class event of this season after 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday begins as planned the short preparation for the second round game against Ajax, which also had sovereignly strained AEK Athens to launch with 3:0.
"Now we've caught up in two games, but we'll also make our doors again," declared National Team Captain Manuel Neuer.
As after the lost podal finale against the entry of Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich Äxt spoke in particular.
The lawyer acted as a machiner.
"I don't think it's all bad, we have to work it out again, because we don't make a lot of chances and make mistakes back," said the 23-year-old shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous game time, even the Bavarians were already with five counters behind Dortmund, which has now taken over the top again with a point of lead.
And so Kimich assessed with an eyebrow, at least positively, that the public debate on the alleged unbeatable Bavarians has now come to an end.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It's good for the League.
DFB Boss in Shossline: Özil-Causa: Sharp Attacks of Erdogan on Grindel
With heavy proposals, Turkish President Erdogan advocates the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
Although DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, he defends the union line.
Now a new post should be created.
Berlin - On different stages Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the interpretative height in the long-standing battle theme Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish Prime Minister strongly criticized the treatment of the former World Champion in Germany for opening the large Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB chief defended the union line.
On the early Sunday morning, the Gryndel personally attacked by Özil announced the consequences of the cause in the Mainzer ZDF "Sportstudio".
"We have to draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have many players with migration backgrounds in the U teams - that something does not happen again," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without migration background as further integration officers.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and DFB.
With sharp words, he had pushed a racist towards Özil and Ilkay Gundogan.
Our born and raised Mesut Özil in Germany and our Ilkay.
They have excluded them from this society because they were able to photograph with me in England," Erdogan said on Saturday in the Domstadt.
Honestly, as your president, I could not believe that our two young men, who have gone up to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil, he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB" after the WM affair that he had taken with Erdogan by photos of the two of them.
At the same time, he announced that he wanted to present himself to players in the future.
What someone says is, if I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm migrant - that's not true.
"That he has such an impression, I am very sorry," Grindel said.
We should have defended more in the moment, I've always said that.
A foundation for a return of Özil to the national team, however, he does not see.
In addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, as a follow-up, an additional integration officer will be appointed.
"If a non-migration background significantly affects society and football and says, "The issue is important, then we have to take care of it," that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local associations where integration needs to work," Grindel said.
Despite criticism from his person after the WM and the Özil affair, he wants to re-appointment as DFB President in the coming year.
"I do my job and try to make it as good as it is," Grindel said.
Yearly builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As the police report, the 75-year-old caused accidents on Friday between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.
At first, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red light in the field of height.
This informed the tenant that he was driving against her car.
However, there was no staff exchange since the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, a telephone call went into the police via a driver who had left the street and had been driving against a highway.
At this point, the man didn't want the police on the spot and then he left.
After that, the Rödtaler drove home.
However, the pensioner has been in his residence in which he has been living for decades to process and takes up a construction vehicle on the turn.
Finally, the police were able to find him and stop him.
His car was clearly damaged.
The 75-year-old made a wrong impression and couldn't recall many more.
The damage is around 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Still almost 1000 operating forces in use.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the Moor fire on a German railway station in Emsland, 980 operating forces are still involved in the destruction.
This was shared by the Federal Defence on Sunday.
As the situation has continued to be stable according to a speaker, 70 honorary assistants have been withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of active forces is planned, it says.
On the night of Sunday, an outer fire was discovered and destroyed.
Last week the disaster was lifted, which was well called out a week before 21 September because it was feared that the flames would endanger forests and settlements adjacent to them by wind and radio.
On Thursday it was said that an invasion of the fire on neighbouring communities no longer threatened.
In time, more than 1,500 forces tried to get the Great Fire under control.
The air weapon further supports the work on the Federal Defence test site at Meppen with a transport screwdriver.
There are also reconnaissance flights with drones of the German army.
According to the Bundeswehr on 2 and 5 October, clarification flights with "Tornados" are scheduled again.
The fire was triggered by testracts fired by airbus technicians.
In time, the smoke of the Moorbrand was drawn to Bremen to a hundred kilometres north-west of Germany.
On Monday, the Federal Defence will set up an addressee who will receive damage reports.
First claims for compensation had already been announced by hotel owners and holiday owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave after their wedding the main church of St. Catherines in Hamburg.
Almost a year after the marriage entered into force for all, the politician married his long-term friend in Hamburg.
They've been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost a year after the marriage entered into force for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday, the two of them gave themselves the Jaword in Hamburg.
If a registered life partnership had not been compromised for them, Kahrs had previously said the "image" session.
If we're married, then we're right.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahr is the budgetary speaker of the SPD Federal Day Group and one of the speakers of the Seeheim Circle, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of the marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had made an Opinion on 30 June 2017.
He had thus proposed to the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to have "stowed" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in anticipation of the alleged announcement of the DDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
They had been able to enter their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as adoption law.
Referendum started in Macedonia on new state names
In Macedonia, the tense referendum on a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters will decide whether their country will be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is due to its equivalent northern province of neighboring Greece.
As a means of printing, Athens had blocked every approach of Skopje to the EU and NATO for nearly three decades.
If the citizens agree to do so, they will also give the start-up committee for the Western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from forgetting
The Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have been 90 years old on September 30.
The 1986 Nobel Prize winner dies in the United States in 2016 and leaves behind a work that preserves the horrors of the Shoah for the underworld.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donation and to relieve family members of stress situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can continue to be taken with express consent, says Swiss transplant.
(dpa) Switzerland will start an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should facilitate organ donation and relieve family members of stress situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes will then be available if necessary by Swiss transplant.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can only be taken with express consent - as in Germany - as Swiss transplants stress.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Switzerland has a donation certificate, says Franz Immer, Director of the Swiss transplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of the cases will a map be found at the crucial moment for possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, people do not know the wish of the deceased.
"They then have to make a decision in the sense of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," he said.
A similar registration system already exists in Britain.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information on the possible organ donation on the hospital card, as the spokesperson of the Federal Center for Health Education, says Marita Völker-Albert.
"There is no register in which people can enter their wishes - pro or counter organ donations," she says.
Federal Minister for Health Jens Spahn has spoken for a new system of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would first be considered as an organ donor unless he or she objects.
Among other things, the Catholic Church denies that.
14-year-old student is a world champion in the puzzle
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is a world champion in the field.
He spent the weekend in Wolfsburg against 39 combatants.
Martina Flamem-Jasper of the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue of the competition, shared this with her on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took the third place.
The youngest WM participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, who was the oldest 74-year-old pensioner from France, as chief judge Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxon) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Since spectators were not allowed, Saturday afternoon there was a show, where participants entered against guests from the audience with pocket computers.
Wenzel Hello from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air when calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Welcome to Bielefeld was then 14 years old two years ago.
With terms such as superbrain, genius or wonder child, organizer Laue can begin little.
"He can train," he said.
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore there are even accounting competitions in stages.
The disciplines include, for example, the square rooting of six-digit numbers.
The diversity calculation provides the candidates with surprise tasks for which they need to quickly find a solution strategy.
Here the Germans also had good chances, the chief judge said.
Otherwise, Asians are often in advantage, because there are already more intensive and effective methods to be taught in early childhood.
Intrusive appeal: video with naked Serena Williams: Early breast cancer recognition
Tennis-Ass Serena Williams is shown by her sensitive and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to point to breast cancer with this video and make herself strong for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings up without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divines" - only their hands cover their most intimate places.
The singer Chrissy Amplett died.
The emotional video is part of the "I Touch Myself" project, where breast cancer early detection can save life.
Serena Williams himself would have died almost a year ago.
When her daughter Alexis Olympia was born, there were complications.
An emergency OP was initiated to save the baby's life.
In a subsequent CT, blood clots were subsequently discovered in Serenas Lunge.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government plans a clear extension of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the Turkish-blue coalition will send a corresponding bill to the so-called "symbol law".
This will clearly extend the number of terrorist or comparable groups that are included in the ban.
Polar cold air brings Neuschnee to the mountains in the west
For the first time in the West, Mrs. Holle shakes off her beds next week: Polare Cold air arrives on Monday Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg.
According to Meteorologists of the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit decreases at the beginning of the week to 1,500 to 1,200 meters - in narrow valleys it was possible to cut it down to about 1,000 meters, said.
From the Bregenzer forest to the High Tauren, it is estimated to be more than 2,000 metres from 20 to 40 centimeters of neuschnee.
On the higher roads (arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Height, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauren, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions will therefore become winter.
Farmers are allowed to start with annual maintenance on Monday
Schleswig-Holsteins Farmers are allowed to begin their annual Knickcare on Monday.
The unique "green whales" in Germany have marked the landscape of the forested federal land for about 200 years.
The trees and shrubs, up to five meters wide, are the last retreats for many animals and plants.
As a corridor, Knicks connects scattered habitats that can still work on the exchange of organisms, as said the managing director of the Natural Protection Bank of Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski.
Knicks are live teeth
The Knicks were seized because of a command by the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living teeth" were not only field limitations and livestock, they also provided farmers with wood and panels for their trade houses.
From that time on, his name is also "Knick": By "knicking" the blades could develop the dense, curved delimitations.
Today, about 45,000 kilometres of the hedges range between the North and the Baltic Sea and give the picture of a woody, multi-structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are currently used as a spare room of around 7,000 animals.
In a kilometer Knick could live up to 1800 different species and break up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, its ecologically important function can only be fulfilled if it is properly maintained in winter.
In addition to the variety of species, it also affects the effects of wind protection, said Ludwichi.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the maintenance of the knick can only be carried out outside the harvest period from October to March.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesiaer talks about the situation on site
The local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and tsunamis in the interview with the editorial network Germany (RND):
Were you on your own during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta at the time on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
Then I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, since the airport at Palu was closed at the time.
How is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that goods can also be flown.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast that were all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" has also been destroyed, but we have temporarily set up something where we have also brought other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many are driven to surrounding hills, where they still endure fear of another tsunami and earthquakes and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are standing in front of their houses, there are still neighbors.
Because many food shops and even the tanks are completely closed, people partly hump food and gasoline.
The public service is completely lost, the national government is helping.
Even a prison was destroyed, the prisoners were partially free and the search for them was difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is communication and information provision going on on the island?
At the moment we received a phone call, but before that did not work and we only got information on the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and others, who do not know whether they live and where they are staying, because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but were on their way to work for example.
The tsunami warning system has not worked properly.
Do you have any information on this?
We don't know why, but when the warning came, many thought, "Okay, not a tsunami," and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by tsunami, there was a lack of information that a tsunami hit the region and they were driven to the surrounding mountains.
Is not an island like Sulawesi on the Pacific Fire ring prepared for earthquakes?
But there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We normally know how we react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the complete infrastructure is broken down, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: VfB has to give up on Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will miss the VfB Stuttgart with severe muscle damage for a long time.
At 2:1 against Werder Bremen on Saturday, Aogo pulled a muscle fiber rice in the back left top, the football leaguer told him on Sunday.
In Donis, the doctors diagnosed a muscle bundled rice in the upper thigh.
Both players are definitely no option against Hanover 96 on Saturday and will probably miss the next country game break.
The VfB Stuttgart did not issue a forecast for the time to expire.
A muscle bundle rice usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber rice usually heals something faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebastian Film Festival
San Sebastián - With the film Festival of San Sebastián annually closes the ranks of the most prestigious European festivals.
All the fads on the cinema can be summarised in spite of this: 2018 was a remarkable year for the film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, especially with strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a Venice, which was able to draw much attention to with Oscar candidates from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of his best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning, the firefighter Olching tried to capture an injured entity.
However, the action went on for some time.
Even a boat came to use.
Olching - Walkers at the Olchinger Lake fell on a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She stopped at the water station.
To help the animal, the passersby called the police and the firearm.
However, the first attempts to catch the ente went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to avoid the forces again and again.
At the end, she ran to the lake.
With a rescue boat, the firearm was able to bypass the animal and push it back to land, where it was then stowed into a transport box after almost an hour by a firefighter with a fierce grip.
The ente injured on the chest was then brought to the animal clinic of the LMU to Oberschleißheim.
But according to the first estimates, their chances of survival are rather low.
Julian Eberhard's Biathlet plays the WM Medalle
Four places at Olympia were Biathlet Julian Eberhard in the stomach for a long time.
In the coming winter, the Hallfeldener wants to recover the missed precious metal at the WM in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympia Sprint of Pyeongchang the one near the medal.
Seven tenths were missing at the end of bronze.
"I have given myself consciously time to process this," Eberhard says when opening the MyGym fitness studio in his home town of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top shape, but it just didn't want to be.
The more motivated the pinzgauer is to imitate the missing precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to come back with the constitution to a big event to win something.
Sometimes you have to hit it too.
The WM loop in Östersund (SWE) is located in Eberhard: "I've already closed the track in my heart", he recalls with joy at his fourth world Cup in the race last year.
Immediately after Olympia he celebrated the only single victory for Austria in the mass start of Kontiolahti (FIN) last winter.
With the staff he went to Oslo (NOR) to rank two.
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation in the turbo tempo
The time is extremely short and the number of expected perceptions is very limited.
With an FBI survey in the turbo tempo, Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure the thin majority for the controversial judges Brett Kavanaugh.
President Donald Trump has set the investigators a deadline until Friday to clarify the alleged events that lie behind for more than 30 years.
The latest developments in the drama around the Kavanaughs call followed by a cultural struggle were triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in whose course the lawyer was angry with the opposition democrats, the Senate's Justice Committee should free the way for the final confirmation of the Supreme Court's conservative judge.
The majority of the Republicans seemed secure when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared against his original announcement that he would agree, but requested an FBI investigation.
After a tumultuous scene, his friends agreed.
President Trump, who had still referred to the heavy performances on Thursday as "Beschiss", first saw further attacks on women and said, on the contrary, "Happiness in the Accident".
In this way, the last doubts could be cleared out, he said.
Later, Trump attacked the Democrats in an election announcement because they refused to "they try to block and destroy".
Trump arranges an FBI investigation in the case of Kavanaugh
The White House has also greatly restricted the powers of the investigators.
One will aim to investigate the well-known charges of two women, no longer, said a government representative to the Wall Street Journal: "They are not going on an angel trip".
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses should be heard.
The mobile radar device installed in a "civil vehicle" of the town community Ried for monitoring the tempolimit is stationed on the garden street according to the city community from Monday, October 1.
There is also the Federal School Center.
The city community also operates several fixed-installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: Fear has been felt
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season victory against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first season victory.
However, against Mainz also played a role in the factor time.
Gelsenkirchen - Meanwhile it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist in football.
That was no different at home against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in it.
And there were many corners and lots of balls in our prison room," said the sports board of Schalke 04 and sighed.
Finally, the king's blue was still able to bring the hardly 1:0 against the Rheinheses over the time and thus bring the first season victory under roof and fence.
It could actually have been different.
After the leadership by Alessandro Schöpf 11 of the team of Chief Coach Domenico Tedesco had given security to Tedesco: "In sum, the first half time was good, both playful and from the press," he obviously played a role more and more with increasing duration.
Don't actually create a baseball memory
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," Heidel said, "if the team was only half as nervous as I was at the bank, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it up, so they kept on retreating.
And defend with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three meters of the season.
"We all liked a huge stone from the heart," said Creator, who had no small share in it with his headball hit: "I am actually the worst headball player in man".
But in the end, only victory.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start printing in the initial phase and make a firework out of it," Schalkes Chefcoach said.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can enjoy a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We've played smart, quiet and brave, so we have to go to parties in 90 minutes.
Perhaps the greatest manko of the afternoon: King Blue missed it, rather for clearer relations of concern.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example by the strong Yevhen Konpllyanka, who twice hit the latte 59/72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a sitter victory," said Tedesco, "you've already felt a bit of fear."
That's why I'm glad we won.
That's why he wasn't the only shaker.
Fish bachau: Smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not to be overlooked.
From about two kilometers away, a hiker in the Leitzachtal observed a fire at 1.30 p.m. on Sunday.
Now the police are investigating.
Fishbachau - The cause soon found out police and firearms: An unknown man had set fire to a large area on a two-square-metre area on the Gschwänner Berg Müll.
According to the police, it seemed as if he had been monitoring the fire for a long time, but then left the glut unattended.
And the one near the forest.
30 Fish-bachauer firefighters were busy with pulling out and deleting.
The police are now looking for a fire department.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion on eye height
The author, Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani, stands before them.
He has followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild repeatedly.
"I've been tasked with getting interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and president of the "Reckenfelder Meeting" - the association that cooperates in the direction of the evening with the Alliance "Cultural Policy".
El-Mafaalani is very slow to enter the reading, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject comprehensiblely.
With a lot of gestures, hand-held numbers and some kind of joke, he brings listeners closer to one of the most conflict-rich themes: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts growing despite successful integration?
The Syrian-speaking author is responsible for answering the question of a metaphor.
The German society sits on a table, the migrants of the first generation sit on the table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they were always sitting on the big table and want to settle with them now.
This leads to conflicts.
It is therefore not a matter of whether you are politically or on the left, but, "Am I for or against an open society?" he emphasises.
At the beginning of the course, the discussion round is always going on.
And there's a need to talk.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, telling two teachers how they see successful or not successful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stands out, not on stage, a sense of discussion: it is at eye height.
The sociology professor does not express his opinion, stresses that he is talking about the average, not about individual fates.
He is happy that there is interest in the subject, because "only when we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
Also during the next signatory hour, he continued to have an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, in prepared Kurdish specialities, intensively further discussion.
basketball: Bonn and throws win live games

ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg won the Frankenderby at St. Oliver Würzburg on Saturday at 84:80.
Construction in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 land
The need is obviously huge: Over 100 stakeholders have applied for the purchase of one of the property in Landsham-South.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first properties in the New Landsham-South area on the free market.
This is shared by Mayor Roland Frick.
In addition, the application phase is completed for those 20 plots that offer the municipality with cheaper conditions or prices - similar to the previous local model.
Good 100 applications have been filed, so Frick.
"Now the documents are being examined", as regards the application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the Plieringer Mayor, it was the goal of having the applicant rankings for the 20 plots by the end of the year and of presenting them to the municipality.
Then the surrender can take place.
In total, 50 land for single and double houses are created on the south of Landsham and four areas for multi-family houses with probably eight housing units each.
The resolution is now as good as completed, the roads and roads will soon be asphalted.
A single plot as well as two of the multi-family houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Pliening.
It sells most of it on the free market, 20 land in the socially compatible model.
According to Frick, the two multifamily houses of the municipality are to be built as a affordable living room.
With a total of 16 apartments supported by the Free State.
Space for 200 people
Grob is estimated to have been created on the surface of the newly built area of Landsham-South Living Room for approximately 200 people.
Not only that: Now, at the beginning of October, according to Frick, there is the start for the new construction of a children's place.
Three children's gardens and three crippling groups as well as a multi-purpose space should be included.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019, at the beginning of the next year's children's garden.
So Schalkes Naldo succeeds "big sport" also at the bank
For the third time not in the beginning: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks to Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues for the third time had not sat in the Schalker Startelf, but on the exchange bank, the understanding would have been great for many people if the almost two meters big Brazilian had spoken so correctly about the hunger of the soul.
But when the Schalker player after the 1:0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05 as usual gathered in the middle circle and thanked Chief Coach Domenico Tedesco for all his professions, the 36-year-old, whom all the simplicity reasons for Naldo, turned on and said, "We have to thank you, Coach!"
"It was very emotional, it was a great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice-Captain, who, despite his renewed reserve service, had no grip.
Probably Naldo, who was celebrated last season as the best shaker, knows that he is actually not on the landing track with his coach - but gets a break for good reasons.
A reason called "tax control".
It wasn't easy to tell him
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I'm telling you quite honestly," Tedesco told me about the moment he told Naldo that he wasn't in the beginning.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the association," said Tedesco.
Naldo played against Bayern and Porto 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It is important that at present all can penetrate.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation that Naldo has recently acquired.
And he responded to that of the Brazilians with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also proving himself on the bank as an exemplary Templar.
The mood in Austria's industry continued to speed up its valley in August compared to the eurozone.
The purchase manager index (PMI) was 46.7 points on a 37-month scale.
However, throughout Europe, Austria has the third best position behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Market Institute announced its survey on Monday among 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the euro area SMEs rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, but the index is still in the 13th month under the 50-counter brand, indicating growth.
In August, Ireland's only industry broke this threshold with 50.9 points.
Finally, the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the voting barometer declined, but was slower than in the months before.
In Spain the index reached the highest level since March with 44.0 points.
"The slightly weakened numeration could mean that the worst is understood," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, the industry - in the third quarter - remains the number one growth brake.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not visible: exports to the euro area have fallen as strongly as since November 2011.
The companies therefore constructed the seventh month as a result.
Even in China, industrial production declined more in August than in the first time.
The mood barometer dropped from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The purchasing manager index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
These include developments in turnover, employment, stocks and prices.
Tuchels PSG team succeeds in the eighth league game
September 29, 2018 at 7:45 p.m.
Nizza Trainer Thomas Tuchel with Paris Saint-Germain in the French Football Championship continues from victory to victory.
At the OGC Nice, the title defender won two matches of Superstar Neymar with 3:0 (1:0) and was also successful in the eighth league.

The Brazilian Neymar led the PSG after 22 minutes and in the follow-up time came the end.
For the interim 2:0 Christopher Nkunku (46.).
Paris also succeeded in the general test for the departing second Champions League group game against the Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
To launch the royal class, Tuchels team at 2:3 in Liverpool had to take the only mandatory landing in this season.
