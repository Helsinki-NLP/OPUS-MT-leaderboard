Eighty-one-year-old chef found dead in a store in San Francisco
This week, the 18-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was the stairs of local commerce.
But the victim’s brother says that he doesn’t think about who wants to hurt him, and he adds, “He’s finally getting better. ”
The body found in Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as an 18-year-old resident of San Francisco Frank Galicia, the office of the judge.
The San Francisco Police Department reported that it was a violent death and investigation.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia for the ABC KGO station in San Francisco said that Frank, who was a former serial cook in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
The Sons & Daughters restaurant said his death was "shocked and destroyed".
“We have a small team that works as a closely connected family. We will miss it very much,” the speaker said.
In this difficult time, our thoughts and sorrows belong to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank first slept in the homes, but that recently “he was finally giving it away.”
"You found the apartment, went with the girl," Louis Galicia told the KGO.
Louis Galicia said he doesn't care who wants to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to join his family, he always cooked our food, made us dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to participate in any fights.
He was the brother who took things the way they were.
"Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was an unbroken diamond that lit every day," he said.

Czech roads have invested over 31 billion vehicles in modernization.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the last six years, public transport has invested over 31 billion crowns in vehicle modernisation.
A third of the trains are currently equipped with air conditioning, and about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
However, parts of modernisation in individual years with the exception of 2012 are gradually decreasing.
Czech roads have invested over 31 billion crowns in vehicle modernisation over the last six years.
One third of the trains are currently equipped with air conditioning, and about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
The money spent was shown to reduce the average age by two years for locomotives and separate units and by six years for classic cars.
A greater proportion of the investment gave the carrier to regional transport, where about 60 per cent of the money was directed, and 40 per cent of the company invested in the renewal of the long-distance vehicles.
Average old locomotives and units are now 19 years old.
Modernized older vehicles, however, are counted as completely new in this indicator.
If the modernisation of vehicles was not calculated, the average age of movement of ČD vehicles would increase by ten years.
An older thing is on average a personal wagon whose average age when calculating modernisation is 23 years.
If only the age from the date of manufacture was taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
However, classic combinations of wagons and locomotives have gradually disappeared in recent years from Czech and global railways and are replaced by motor or electrical units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the train lost 280 to 223 pieces, and the number of classic cars dropped from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
In particular, the carrier released old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without being able to block the opening during the journey.
From January to July, the carrier let 110 of these cars crash.
For example, it is possible to introduce 50 cars for speed up to 200 kilometres per hour, which the carrier plans to land on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electricity units for foreign speed routes.
The contract includes up to 30 parts of motor and 20 parts of electrical units.
Four-year-old authorities know about illegal advertising, they can't get rid of it.
We're totally powerless, they admit.
Already the fourth year of the online edition of Aktuálně.cz is following the story of a billboard in the Czech Republic, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipna, where there is not only a touristic interesting passage in the crowns of trees, but also an Olympic park.
The station managers know it's black, but they say they can't do anything about it.
There are hundreds of similar advertisements all over the country, perhaps thousands.
According to officials, there is a law on guilt, which makes it impossible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
Need is a complex bureaucratic wheel ahead.
In the meantime, the company will change its name and the office will be short on it.
Or it's enough to move the ad by a few meters and the official process has to start again.
The Directorate of Roads and Roads four years ago admitted: at the main knowledge from the Czech Budějovic on Lipno stands on our property at the public road advertising billboard in black.
Even for three months, however, officials were not able to get rid of illegal portable structures with a huge advertising poster.
It's like nobody's mind standing right next to the car in a 50-inch seat belt where security doesn't make any sense.
Road managers say they can't afford to consult a billboard because of the law.
He should be loaded and taken away.
"We must not allow this to happen," says the spokesperson of the Directorate of Roads and Roads Nina Ledvinová and refers to the complex bureaucratic wheel that billboard removal must be done by law.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate began online journal Aktuální.cz to monitor in detail in the spring, is not unique and indicates a general problem that cannot be put in place effectively and quickly by the authorities.
Only in the Czech Republic, she counted dozens of similar mobile advertisements placed against the rules right next to or near the car.
There are also other countries.
"We have trouble forcing companies to remove the binders," says the head of the Transport Committee of the Czech Republic Regional Office of Jiří Klas, whose colleagues are dealing with similar stories.
According to the Class, there is a law of guilt that binds officials.
First of all, the complicated owners of the billboard have to address to get the advertisement off.
But the bosses are often invincible or know the fiction that Aktuálná.cz has described in the past when the problem began to be more interesting: enough mobile stand with advertising to move about a few meters and officials can put the previous challenge to the removal of the black ad into the trash.
That's because the office has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard is.
"If someone moves it and the coordinator suddenly disagrees with it, it looks like a new device and we have to call the owners again," explains Jiří Klas.
A new law won't help.
The amendment could bring in a new law that would prohibit billboards at the motorways from September next year and restrict them at the I. class roads.
Critics point out that the rules for banning illegal and easily transferable advertising will remain the same.
And the authorities don't get away with it.
Companies can continue to make tens of hundreds of millions of crowns a year on illegal land rentals, and no one can afford them.
For example, the billboard on July belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials know her well: the Chezkobudjev magistrate currently runs three administrative procedures for billboards.
The firm is threatened by a fine of thirty in each case.
These are more advertisements that have been placed without permission in the I. Class road protection zone.
Management has not yet been completed, says Jaroslav Mráz, head of the Transport Committee of the Czech Republic Magistrate.
The advertising that Aktuálná.cz is interested in, although it does not yet appear among these cases, but will soon be with the highest probability.
According to speaker RSD, Nina Ledvin's company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and the case will thus be brought to the regional table and then probably to the magistrates.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious companies that cannot be contacted.
She doesn't pick up the mail and the official seat on Zižkov cancelled more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the company's post came to the South American businessman Anton Fischer, who spoke out in a heated dispute with the head of the Czech representation of the Hyundai brand.
Fischer, whose Euro Billboard leases and offers them to the advertisers, has refused any connection in the past.
However, this spring, when RSD began to raise Aktuální.cz to be interested in advertising on July, Fischer let state officials send a letter to the secret company Commerz Billboard to his pension, where the new company allegedly lives.
Even from this address, however, no one has responded to the railway managers yet.
An empty fight.
Similar silence or opaque changes in seats are not uncommon.
One company we gradually fined two million crowns a few years ago.
But she changed her name and ICHO, and there was nothing to do.
The executor's case came back, the commercials continued, maybe elsewhere.
We are quite powerless against similar companies and their business practices.
It's like a fight with windmills, admitting under the condition of keeping anonymity one of the officers.
The new law in this regard has not yet been resolved.
At present, several Members have spoken with the problem.
But so far, they have not developed any activity.
On the contrary, there were Members who wanted to extend the deadline for keeping billboards in the main Czech communications.
The government rejected it.
Billboards are not only for the whole state, but also for regional and general policy very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand after their restrictions, on the other hand, they themselves need them for advertising in pre-election campaigns.
I don't stand in the way of the idea that if something doesn't work, we need to change the laws.
Farmers grow less grain this year, but more rape and maka, estimate statistics.
According to the estimates of the Czech Statistical Office, the harvest of cereals this year will be 6,7 per cent lower than last year.
However, this year’s harvest has exceeded the average in the last five and ten years.
On the contrary, it will be higher (at 3.9 per cent) and higher (2.5 per cent).
The harvest harvest will be 6.7% lower this year than last year.
Farmers make up 7.2 million tons of grain.
This is due to the estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office on 15 July.
The initial estimate of the month ago was more pessimistic and predicted a tenfold decrease against last year.
Last year's wheat harvest was overaveraged.
This year's harvest has exceeded the average in the last five and ten years.
On the contrary, this year there will be a loudening of tails and tails.
Herbs grow by 3.9 percent more than a year ago, when they got 1,256 million tons.
This year's crop may be 2.5 percent higher than last year's crop.
The expected decrease in the production of cereals is due both to a reduction in the yield of the hectare by 3,7 per cent to 5,71 tonnes per hectare, and to a reduction in the yield of the crop area.
This year, farmers raised three percent less fields.
The winter wheat, which is the most important grain for the Czech Republic, is estimated to grow by 3.3 per cent less this year.
The farmers then sent her out to more fields.
However, a lower hectare yield will be signed down to 6.04 tonnes.
The five-fold decrease in statistics is assumed in the spring barley, which is most commonly used for beer production.
The evidence is reduced by 15.2 per cent, but also by a lower yield per hectare.
On the contrary, winter barley is produced by 6.3 percent more.
You'll also grow the harvest harvest.
The species of rape is estimated to be 1,305 million tonnes, which is more against last year.
The autumn areas have expanded by 7.3 per cent.
Hectaric yield will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year's crop of straw exceeds the average of 13.3 per cent, while the seed is on the surface of a third larger than ten years ago.
In the last four years, he's also been in the field with the maquerade.
This year he was landed by farmers on 35,543 hectares.
By 2008, when the maka grew on record 70,000 hectares in the Czech Republic, it is a field of half.
As a result of the expansion of the shadow areas, this year’s peak will be richer.
It will rise to 2.5 per cent last year at 27 423 tonnes.
Hectaric yield, but it's going to be 6.1 percent lower.
Breakout police accused two men of assault with a knife and a knife, and the court sent him to prison.
The police accused two attackers who attacked a 50-year-old man in downtown Olomouse on Tuesday.
"Although the attacker tried to escape, he was wounded and severely injured, which required hospital treatment and other treatment," said police spokesman Marie Šrbáková.
Both of the alleged perpetrators were detained immediately after the attack.
The complainant submitted a proposal to the court for their arrest and the court ordered him on Friday.
Both men are threatened with three to ten years in prison.
The police accused two detainees of assaulting a 50-year-old man in the center of Olomouse with a knife and a knife.
The attackers caused him a stabbing and cutting wound, and the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between the two groups of people who took place on Tuesday afternoon at the right of the Freedom class, the police said.
Pachatels ended up in custody, informed the police spokesperson Marie Šrbáková.
A massive flow between the two families took place in the garden area in front of the Tratorie bar in the immediate vicinity of the center of Olomouce.
After an aggressive verbal conflict, two attackers attacked by a 50 - year - old man with a knife and a cat.
Although the attacked man tried to escape, he was wounded and severely injured, which required hospital treatment and other treatment, reported the police spokesperson.
There were family disputes during the raid, which aroused great attention in the city center and which involved several police guards and police officers.
Criminals from Slovakia and from Olomouc accused them of trying to cause serious harm to health and to the market.
The plaintiff filed a proposal for their arrest and the court ordered him on Friday to fill out the speaker.
The machete was used in the centre of Olomouse in a massive battle by attackers five years ago, then only a few dozen metres away, before the Varna discotheque in Riegrov Street.
At that time, the police reported that the group of about ten foreigners with weapons attacked visitors of the company that stood before the entrance.
According to the police, they had knives, holes and cats in their hands.
The court then punished two foreign attackers with a conditional penalty.
Left and empty houses in the centre of Prague.
You'll be surprised, maybe you'll walk around them every day.
One of the most crippling examples of the unused and empty house is the extensive building of the former IPB residence in the centre of Senovažnoj Square.
She was supposed to be a hotel a long time ago.
It's still nothing.
That you need to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
And what about the use of existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Directly in the centre of Prague in the immediate vicinity of Václav Square there are several mansion houses, which, despite their location, size and often memory protection, are empty and empty.
The property in the centre was selected using the project Prazdédomy.cz, which maps the long-term empty property in the territory of the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of financial problems of their owners, transparent relations between companies or belong to a state that does not or does not want to get rid of them.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than homeless.
Let the owners pay special taxes for them, he wants the initiative

Clinton's husband made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to publish his tax confession.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, president Bill Clinton last year made $10.6 million.
More than a million dollars spent on charity to Clinton.
Most of Clinton's revenues -- over six million dollars -- are for their performances.
Trump refuses to publish his tax confession.
The candidate for the U.S. Democratics' presidential office Hillary Clinton published her tax returns on Friday, increasing the pressure on her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, president Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year, announced the AP agency.
Most of Clinton's revenues - over six million dollars - are for their performances, mainly from the period before April 2015, when Clinton started her campaign before the elections.
The tax report showed that Clinton’s husband was last year charged with a federal income tax of 34.2 per cent and then taxed at the state and local levels of nine per cent.
So they paid 43.2 percent of the income in total.
But Trump has a similar problem with a similar step, so far he has not decided to publish tax recognition.
It is certain that Donald Trump will not pay any taxes at all, wrote Clinton on Twitter a few minutes after his confession.
Clinton returns to the secret of Trump's revenues repeatedly, among other things, to raise doubts as to whether her opponent is really as rich as they claim, the AP agency said.
Trump's assets are estimated at billions of dollars.
A lower benefit would damage the reputation of the Republican candidate as a successful entrepreneur.
Senator Tim Caine, who is running for the post of vice president in tandem with the former lady, has today published a report on his tax derivatives in the last ten years.
Together with their wife, Anne Holton, they paid 7.5 per cent of their charity expenses and paid 25.6 per cent last year's taxes.
In Nigeria, the turnout was repeated.
The Islamists from Boko Haram defended the subsequent abortion and killed the doctors.
Cases of child-refoulement have reappeared in Nigeria.
In the northeastern part of the country, the government declared an extraordinary expectation because two children infected with this disease were protected.
Vaccines were carried there by helicopters.
In the affected areas, Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram, who defended their beliefs and even killed their doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there was an undetected virus.
In the northeastern Nigeria, extraordinary expectations for children are beginning to rise, as there are two children who are infected with this disease.
In Africa the revolution was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government announced that there would be millions of children in the state of Borno and another four million in the surrounding states.
On Friday, Nigerian military helicopters, according to the AP agency, quickly transported vaccines against child-rearing to the affected northeastern part of the country, where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram act.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the virus has been evaporating for many years.
Extremists from Boko Haram have in the past defended their father - in - law and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also on Thursday made it impossible for doctors to get into areas where children with vice versa were found.
The two affected battalions came with refugees from Nigeria newly freed from Boko Haram.
The director of the WHO section responsible for the defamation of Michel Zaffran BBC station said that the wait in Nigeria is starting next week.
In the state of Borno, the Islamic radical group Boko Haram has long been involved.
The area has been made available to international organisations and governments until the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram has managed to weaken in this part of the country in a fundamental way.
The Nigerian Minister of Health Isaac Adewole admitted that new cases of opposition were a major disappointment to the country because Nigeria wanted to announce next year that the defence had been launched.
WHO noted that it is possible that although the disease has not occurred for two years, it has spread among children.
The children will now be waiting until they are five years old.
In 2012, half of all cases of the world's reverse occurred in Nigeria.
While in 1988 it was still in 125 countries, it is now only in three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan and in northern Nigeria.
The Pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the moving stories of fallen women.
Pope Francis met with twenty former prostitutes who, thanks to the police, escaped from the gang of passports.
The pope listened to their difficult life stories and asked them to look to the future with confidence.
František wanted to point out this meeting about human trafficking and to call for a stronger fight against it.
Pope Francis met with twenty former prostitutes in Rome who had been freed by the police from the power of the gang of passports.
The head of the Catholic Church listened more than an hour to the moving stories of fallen women and then urged them to look to the future with confidence, the Vatican spoke.
Among the former prostitutes who visited František were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is about 30.
All were subjected to severe physical violence during forced prostitution according to the Vatican.
On his visit, František wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and to call for a stronger fight against him, the pope said.
František often points to people's fates on the edge of society.
For example, on Thursday he lunched with Syrian refugees who arrived in the Vatican this year in April and June thanks to his personal invitation.
France is going to hit the jihadists' factory.
Without the help of Muslims, it won't work.
The French are fighting radical Islam with the help of Muslims themselves.
Moreover, the government of Prime Minister Manuel Valles is about to undergo fundamental changes in the functioning of the mix and the education of the clergy.
Since last December, we've closed 20 mixes and prayer.
And the next one will follow, the minister in.
There's over a hundred jihadists in the country.
"If Muslims do not help the state in the fight against those who violate public freedom, it will be even more difficult for France to guarantee this recognition of freedom," Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
In particular, it is appropriate to ensure that only property educated in France is preached in the synagogues and in prayer.
At the same time, he wants to stop funding from mixing abroad.
Currently, about 20 percent of the money comes from foreigners to build new mixtures, most from Morocco, Algeria and the Gulf of Persia.
And because of this, there are preachers who can spread radicalism in France.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," the prime minister added.
The key to achieving these goals will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should act as a bridge between a secular state and a Muslim minority.
No more foreign money.
In the country now the French Foundation for Islam, founded by the then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin in 2005.
By then, the hope had contributed to the review of the financial flows between the mixes and the countries financing their construction.
But the institutions soon came to grips with internal disputes and rivalry.
"It's a total failure," Valls noted recently.
After the attack on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, the French political scene sparked a debate about a new institution that will replace the non-functional foundation.
All the other terrorist attacks in France, which have been carried out on behalf of the Islamic State, have been carried out by radicalised Islamists.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve has recently heard that a new hope will arise in October.
He will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of blends from domestic sources and also to monitor assets.
For the time being, it is not clear where he will take money not only to build new mixtures but also to various educational centers.
But he's considering a few suggestions.
One of them is a special fee or a food hall tax.
In practice, the salespersons would pay for the food hall, which is for certification.
Some of this money would then travel right into the cash collection.
The contribution of ten to twenty euros (270 to 540 kroner) could then be paid by French passengers who go to Mecca.
Each year they travel there on a traditional journey to Saudi Arabia about 30,000.
And it's not just that.
According to the prime minister, only teachers who have gone through special training programmes at French universities should be involved in future mixes.
This should ensure that the preaching is in line with democracy.
We'll close the radical mixtures.
At the same time, the French government is drawing on radicals.
And the next one will follow, the Minister of Interior has recently announced.
There is no place in France for those who report hatred in the mix and do not respect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
In the country, it is estimated that some 2,500 mixes and prayers are involved.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islam.
Since 2012, the authorities have hosted around 80 assets and several more decades have considered this.
Not everyone thinks that the government's steps can significantly affect radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize will do the same.
Because it doesn't come into the mix, young people radicalize on the Internet, says Severine Labatová, an expert at the National Centre for Scientific Research.
Drahař Kelemen lost in the 1st round of the sprint with the Bauguem star.
The procedure for the osmiffinal must be performed by the Czech road cyclist in repair rides.
The road cyclist Pavel Kelemen in the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, following the process of qualifying sprint among the best eighteen, won in the 1st round a match with the French great Gregory Baugém, a silver defender from the past games in London.
The procedure for the osmiffinal must be killed in repair rides.
At the start of the royal discipline on the road, 27 riders were built, and the best Czech runner at the time was assigned the fourteenth best time.
The two-year-old with a summer start arrived in 9,969 seconds.
In the main separation phase, he was so expected in the qualification of the fifth Baugé, who already has bronze in the team sprint from Rio.
Kelemen finally reached out to an experienced Frenchman, but he looked at the procedure.
With a great performance, the gold defender Jason Kenny shined.
Eighty-eight-year-old Britain occupied the third fastest two-way history and won the Olympic record 9,551.
It is easy then, as expected, to consult also with the last process, which was Germany's Maximilian Levy.
A British quartet was also awarded in a composition with Bradley Wiggins, who entered a new world record of 3:50,570 and entered the final.
The peak (3:51,659), belonging to the British four years from the London Olympics, improved by more than a second.
Young Doctors Press: Wanting a fresh wind in the field
Representatives of young doctors met to approve new steps in their dispute over a new contract.
The Council of Young Doctors (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) must request the entire Council to support further field actions from the beginning of September.
JDC says the ministers were unable to resolve the contract issues.
Young doctors and medical students in July voted against the contract agreement agreed with BMA.
58% of its members who took part in the elections were rejected.
In a letter to the members published on Thursday night on Twitter, President JDC Ellen McCourt stated that the government remained "still silent" on issues which led to the rejection of the contract.
She said: “In this light, the executive authority has decided by the JDC vote to reject the proposed new contract completely and to request a new formal procedure in all matters.”
In response to the government's silence today, the JDC Executive Board formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to approve the current programme of targeted sectoral actions from the beginning of September.
This year, the dispute led the young doctor to six posts, including the first general posts in the history of NHS.
The leader of young doctors in BMA, Dr. Johann Malavan, resigned after the decision to refuse the agreed terms of the contract recommended by BMA.
BMA members at the meetings before the 54,000 young doctors and medical students said the agreement was good and should be adopted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health said the contract would be a burden for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: Union of "inseparable"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to raise their hands and announce the formal end of eight months of long verbal war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counterpart to the palace hall in Petrograd, I had the impression that Ankara wanted more of this reconciliation.
There's been hand-in-hand, yes.
But Putin didn't laugh, and he barely had a sense of warmth, even according to his measured standards.
On the contrary, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke about his "dear friend" Mr Putin - five times as one of the reports states.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their pre-crisis level, but would be even better.
Another day one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan was acting like nothing bad ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm was the opposite.
But the lasting cold that was evaporating from Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: Shooting a Russian warplane Turkish on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was urgent.
Putin was throwing wounds around himself, and he accused Ankara of killing Moscow in the back.
The worse it was that it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
The Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
The state-controlled media carried out a massive campaign against Ankara a month later.
Suddenly it seemed like the Turks could do everything.
More serious was the accusation from the top state officials that Erdogan's own family benefited from the illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
This guy's stubbornly denied it.
But there was an official message in Petrograd that it was time to move on.
At the end of this meeting, it was only because Putin got the apology he requested from President Erdogan.
Russia could have announced a victory as well.
The benefits of the declaration for Ankara are relatively clear.
First of all, Erdogan was almost out of power last month during the unlucky puke and therefore he needs all his friends.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have apparently also shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions had a strong impact - especially the cancellation of charter flights, which will carry several million Russian tourists on Turkey's coast every year.
This figure has been reduced by almost 90 %.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies here will breathe when the flights are renewed.
They're making a profit on Mediterranean travel at the end of the season.
Even this week, the state television promised cheaper fruit and vegetables when the importation of agricultural commodities from Turkey is allowed again.
"Tourists there, they're going back here," the report in the Vedemat newspaper reported.
But the visit had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers to be a failure to react to a coup attempt.
In addition, the long-term impunity of long-term EU accession talks and Putin's accession - which inspires the cooling to use and break Turkey's ties to the West.
The Russian leader certainly won the bonus points when Ankara asked her for help from the elected authorities after an attempt at a puddle.
You have to understand that for Moscow, which is deeply rooted in fear of changing the regime, it is given.
So the summits in this pompous, eastern palace of Russia and Turkey have been able to show me what one analyst described me as "the alliance of the incompatibles": how they connect the forces of the two countries that feel to be rejected and used by the West.
However, despite public reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between these two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently became a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey stand on opposite sides.
It could be said that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents at the press conference indicated that they had not even mentioned this issue.
The Turkish President has deliberately answered the question of differences between them, while Putin has decided to raise these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which both States could find a common language on the Syrian issue.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian warplane - it is certainly better that both leaders speak again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
According to the Executive Director of the Bank, the RBS brand is to be suppressed into the role of the back office.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be lost for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was connected to the bank's global ambitions.
She dropped out of them when she almost disappeared eight years ago and had to be redeemed from debt.
At that time, the strategic labels were used by RBS to protect other consumer finances.
There were millions of pounds spent on sponsoring international sports, from the 6th Nations football championship after the Winbledom champion Andy Marray.
But now it has been decided that it is better to give more prominence to national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but it will not start new businesses.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of central and stock coding on the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that will get more ahead - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During the trip to customers and employees at the Inverness-shire McEwan answered questions from Ross McEwan.
BBC Station Scotland said: "The RBS brand will cease to be our investment brand and brand for which our employees are working, because now we are becoming a much more brand bank."
Because the bank itself became a global brand, it became a global brand and RBS.
Now I'm saying we don't have global aspirations anymore, we have efforts focused on home stage.
Each of these marks will mean something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work under these marks.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue in its sponsorship of the Six Nations Championship, prepared a profile of individual sports sponsorship marks.
"It is time for us to move to the brand bank, because the basic question (which we are asking) is how to focus on becoming a better bank for customers?" said the Executive Director.
Three years ago, it would be very cynical if we said we were going to be a great bank for customers and the brands.
But along with how we focused on customer needs, and not on our own, I think there's a lot of change coming.
We can remember these marks again, I think the right time has come.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket on the horse Predilection led to the 3,000th winner
Dettors blow the champagne after the double win in Newmarket brought him 3,000 wins
Kokoj Frankie Dettori won 3,000 in Britain on Friday in New Market.
This milestone was achieved with its second victory of the evening on its local track - on the horse Predilection, which John Gosden is training.
Fifty-five-year-old Italy is the sixth jockey who has achieved such a result in equal achievements.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-way champion of Dettori, who had previously won the Ghayyar horse, said, "It's strange."
I'm very impressed because my family is here too.
I'm so glad it happened in Newmarket, because I got stuck here 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a Friday night on earth with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved, and I'm very grateful.
Dettor collects congratulations when it brings Predilection to victory
Two jockeys of this mill have reached obstacles - the Richard Johnson jockey champion and the 20-person champion of Sir Anthony McCoy, who, during his career, scored more than 4,300 winners.
Lester Piggott, the ninth winner Derby, 4,493 winners in the career
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times, and it is not surprising that he has reached a millet that only a few riders have achieved before him.
He's stylish and strong, but he's just his tactical fistron that distinguishes him from the other riders in the stable.
He is a fantastic ambassador of achievements, his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fans to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he didn't just go on weekends and get big, he'd already have 6,000 winners!
But the truth is that Frankie was driving a winner in Britain for most of his 30-year career, and that's really something.
He's a living character, which is good for British racing, but more importantly, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous summer jump
From summer finishers to summer jumps - Frankie Dettori was the messenger of British even ranges for two decades.
It was like a ride on a mountain road.
Unprecedented number of major race winners, including his well-known "seven" in Ascot. But he also survived the plane crash and had a ban on the launch of drugs.
Three years ago, when he was returning after six months of banning his start, he showed incredible inner strength and returned in the best form to all doubters.
And maybe it won't last - Dettori already said he'd like to continue in the race for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin missed the head of the president's office Sergei Ivanova
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly missed Sergei Ivanov on Friday from the post of head of the president's office.
Ivanov was one of Putin's closest collaborators after many years.
Thirty-three-year-old Ivanov was appointed a special representative for the environment and transport.
The Kremla statement states that Putin "released Ivanova from his service to the head of the Russian Presidential Office", but no reason was given.
We will take over Anton Vajno, who has been Ivan's representative since 2012.
Forty-four-year-old Vajno was a diplomat before.
He was born in the capital of Estonia Tallinn in 1972, promoted at the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
The website (Russian) states that he later served as the head of the President's Protocol and the President's Office.
When appointing Putin, he said, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your head of state activities in terms of the draft laws and controls to the extent to which your instructions are complied with.
Putin said Friday at the Russian television station that Ivanov had asked her to be released from the post and recommended that he replace her just by Vajno.
Convinced of the smiles?
This step has completely mysticized Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest collaborators of Vladimir Putin for a long time and worked for the KGB as well as Putin.
As the head of the president's office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who broadcast state television, both men declared that the head of the president's office was leaving at his own request.
But laughter in the Chambers has convinced only a few people - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So it's the consequence of some power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that the man who was once considered a potential president wanted to lead Russia's ecological policy suddenly met with great mistrust.
On the Kremlu pages are quoted the comments addressed to Putin, in which Ivanov states: “It is true that in 2012 I asked you in the discussion to give me this very demanding post, even a problematic post, entrusted to me for four years.
I seem to have been the head of the president's office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov was arrested in December 2011.
Previously, he was the vice president of the government and the Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and has previously, like Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin led the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his representative.
When Putin came into power, he named Ivanova one of his five closest associates.
It even speculated that Ivanov could become the successor of Putin to the state after his second election period because the third period would be anti-constitutional for Putin.
But this post was taken over by another close associate of Putin's, Dmitrij Medvedev.
Putin became a prime minister about three and a half years later before he returned to the presidential office.
Thomas Gibson, the star of the Crimean thought series, was released after he hit the director
Gibson got involved last month in Los Angeles in the physical exchange of views on the scene.
The television stations ABC and CBS, which produce the series, have announced in their joint release announcement.
Gibson, who played special agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before his release.
There have been creative differences on the scene and disagreements.
I'm sorry it happened," he said in a statement.
According to the ABC and CBS television stations, details of how Gibson's character disappears from the series that follows the stories of the FBI team of agents later on.
The four-and-a-half-year-old actor, who celebrated his main role in the Dharma and Greg sitcom, has been active in the series since the first series in 2005.
"I love the thoughts of criminals and have given them hearts and souls over the past twelve years," said Gibson in his statement, which he issued on Friday.
I was hoping I'd be in it until the end, but it won't be possible right now.
I would still like to express my thanks to the authors, the producers, the actors, our amazing team and especially the great fans that this show could ever hope for.
The return of the series to the twelfth series is expected on 28 September.
In Banff there are mysteriously landed in the fish garden
A man from Banff town asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish can be sand dunes that left water debris there.
Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, on the Periscope channel, published a short film of his discovery, in the sense that someone could help him explain how about 5 centimeters of fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connects with Fife
Project for 1.35 billion pounds is to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern plateau and Queensferry Crossing and viaduct - the bridge now connects with Fife.
So this is the first of the four conclusions between the "plashes" which are now almost completed around each of the three bridge pylons.
The part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tonnes of iron and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 chained wires.
The project for EUR 1.35 billion is to be completed by May 2017.
Economic secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the fortress to the bridge.
He said: “This is the historic moment and the symbolic moment of the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
In this project, we are all witnesses to how construction engineers have actually used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive dimensions and gravity of the bridge, the conclusion between the viaduct and the surface of the bridge was a delicate operation requiring extraordinary accuracy.
There is now a total of more than 79% of the total area of the bridge, concrete for the last part of the platform is now being poured into Rosyth, so the entire platform is ready to climb to the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: “The first closure in building each bridge is always an important milestone.
In this wonderful project, this conclusion represents the tip of the earthly building.
After installing the last part of the road platform and its connection to the expanding North Tower platform, we then had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by stretching the north approaching viaduct 700 millimetres south.
This was massive and at the same time very delicate.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tonnes and was required to pull it by climbing about 3%.
Decisive because the tolerances that the team was working with were very small - just a few millimetres each way.
It all worked out very well.
Saved in Moelfre Bay: Three men are "happy that they are alive"
Three men are "happy that they're alive" after they've scared the water out of their fishing boat at England.
The rescue ship station Moelfre RNLI announced a warning on Friday at 13:20 a.m. after the crew had seen the incident in the Moelfre Bay.
All three men were trying to swim in safety while their ship continued unmanned.
"We saw their ship circling in their vicinity and thought we were the worst," said the rescuer Moelfre Vince Jones.
"The strong wind fortunately took her away from them even before we left," he added.
Two men saved the local fishing ship, the third man 60 years old was found without a life jacket exhausted as the fighters hold.
All were transferred on board a lifeboat and transferred back to the lifeboat station
Jones said: “Three men throw themselves into the water are happy that they are alive and completely harmless.
The engine of the ship had a rope for emergency decommissioning, but somehow it came to disconnect it from the person who drove the ship when it came back.
Someone was holding a protective hand over those guys.
The judge refuses to handle the case because of Tlucher's wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of the three MPs who was accused of getting from Prime Minister Nezeze and his then head of cabinet Jany Nagy's political traffic, which is a lucrative post for a political retreat.
In 2012, the tax package was approved.
Schneidr, Fuksa and Tluchoř allowed him with their resignations.
Then they appeared at influential positions in state companies.
And that's why they also faced suspicions of bribery and ended up in prison for a month.
According to the court, however, it was not justified, and the damages amounted to almost 2 million crowns.
The fat man now appears in the case as a witness, after the Supreme Court intervenes.
His wife works in the fruit market courthouse and resolves civil disputes.
However, he wants to be a judge of the King's custody (solve criminal matters - see . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The case is likely to cause concern to another Prague court district.
However, the Queen has released the guilt of Jan Nézej, previously Nagy.
It was a alleged abuse of military intelligence to monitor Prime Minister Neczeze Radka's first wife.
In this case, Tluchoř did not appear.
According to lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, this is an excessive reaction.
I don't think impartiality can be interpreted as such to rule out if witnesses have a wife or relative in court.
I'm afraid he wouldn't judge anything then, he noticed for the diary.
"I think it's disgusting," he added.
In the case of political traffic, Roman Boček, a former official, is also accused.
According to his lawyer, Peter Toman, however, a possible objection would have a chance of success.
On June 13th, the District Court of Prague appealed a complaint by former head of the cabinet of Prime Minister Petr Nezeze Jany Nagyová (now Nezezewo) and other accused of abuse of the Military Reporting.
Netimes and his husband are coming to the court.
The fathead was supposed to solve Perutkov's predictions.
For example, the wife of the exhibition was to judge President Milos Zeman's predictions about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Perutkov.
Zeman declared him to be sympathetic to Adolf Hitler.
One of the girls is already dead!
The girl must have died on the flight of the Allied forces.
She went to Syria with her two same old girlfriends last February from the London Gatwick airport.
The British Ministry has not commented on the report of her death.
Young Londoners who fled their homes were secretly transferred to Syria, according to the police, across the Turkish border.
Shamima Begumová, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana have joined the media for their other former co-worker from the London Bethnal Green Academy.
Last year's case caused a huge wave of attention and tension in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security records estimate that about 600 British Muslims have travelled to Syria, some 50 young women and girls.
A number of them joined radicals from IS and other groups.
Those who return home represent a terrorist threat to Britain.
Dream work for a hundred bucks.
Well paid work that you don't even need a high school for.
That's how it looks at the first look of the egg's work.
And often the other one.
The advantage is not only extremely high pay in Czech terms (in Prague you will earn up to 180,000 Kč) but also extreme benefits.
The reason is the huge lack of IT specialists.
There are thousands of specialists missing.
According to estimates, nearly 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
Among the most sought-after are programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists, according to the statistics of the Grafton Personal Agency.
Candidates can choose between a few job offers.
So they do not match the candidates for the position, but the position for the candidates, comments Jitka Soucová, marketing manager Grafton Recruitment.
High school is not necessary.
Higher education, however, is not necessary for students.
Higher education is a good foundation and is a general indicator of the intelligence and educational ability of the candidate, but it often has little in common with the knowledge of development.
Developers have to learn new things all the time, which once a trained high school doesn't pay off, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Career CZ.
She'll make the most of it in Prague.
The wages of the natives are moving high above the republican average.
For the most money they'll come to Prague and Brno, in the regions it's no longer such a hit.
"The pay conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague," Kubačka confirms.
For the highest cost, technical directors will reach.
In Prague and Brno they can come to 120,000 - 180,000 CZK.
In other regions, pay is lower, but it does not fall below 80,000 CZK.
Demands are also IT project managers.
They can make 60,000 - 100,000 CZK on the show.
The fight's also about graduate.
While in some professions, graduates often have to go straight to the employment office, they don't pay for it.
Therefore, if companies move and transfer experts from another company, they are happy to reach out to the graduates.
They can raise him according to their own.
They won't leave without their tongue.
The knowledge of a foreign language takes place in every profession, but English is required at least in good English.
The knowledge of at least one foreign language is necessary in some IT positions.
On the other hand, we are meeting with a number of cases where companies are looking especially for skilled and experienced people and are satisfied only with the average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, a support worker controls more foreign words, it is interesting for his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, the Director of Cuba provides.
Jooó in Google, there's paradise.
It's just that they can look at more common workers in Google.
Of course, they have a flexible working time, the possibility of working from home or a variety of shorter relationships, not just for their mothers.
"The newlyweds are given four weeks' leave to the company after the baby is born," says Martina Joneková, Google's spokesman.
Hitchhiking also carries health care for employees and family, feeding, transport, training, wellness or massage directly at the workplace.
Whoever wants to learn has green and doesn't matter what he wants to learn.
But that doesn't end the benefits.
Such a full-free refrigerator is definitely not for sale either.
A healthy lunch (in some places and breakfast and dinner) is available on site every day.
Moreover, there are so-called microwaves in all the offices where people will always find a healthy meal, the speaker announces.
And so that nothing has to be thrown out, what's wrong, it's put into boxes that employees can take home tonight.
And the reason for these in the Czech relationship of incredible benefits?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
"For Google, it is not important for employees to sit in the office for eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, movement or development, ideas and innovative solutions," the speaker said.
The United Nations has strongly criticised Bulgaria for the criminalisation of refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, UN Commissioner for Human Rights, accused Bulgaria on Thursday of systematically violating the human rights of the criminalisation of refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government "is causing serious concern about Bulgaria's non-compliance with international law", Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein warned in a statement.
He noted that "it is particularly disturbing to be a witness to how important and influential public personalities express public support for criminal armed fighters who run the hunts on refugees at the border between Bulgaria and Turkey".
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who go through Bulgarian territory are automatically arrested," Zeid stressed.
And what is worse, if they try to get out of the earth, are often punished and imprisoned for a year or longer.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that everyone has the right under international law to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria held 14 000 migrants this year, last year for the same period of 21,000.
Pokémon Go - a hunt for health and happiness that will pay
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
A number of people have complained over the past decade that teenagers and children no longer play outdoors and give preference to spending free time in front of the screens.
Pokémon brings him up from the hills and leads him to activity.
The time spent in front of the screens was originally wasted on television, later on video games and the latest on smart phones.
It's great to see that technology and activities outside are not mutually exclusive.
Of course, I'm talking about the fashion that Pokémon Go is, an app based on the constructions that first appeared in video games at the end of the 1990s (later came a drawn series, playing cards, etc.).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a decline in interest in the introduction of this new game at the beginning of July in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.
The designation in other countries was then postponed because of the potential interest that led to the overload of servers.
Pokémon Go won over several days more users than Tinder and almost as many users as he has Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players on the smart phone go out looking for Pokémons who are tracking them using GPS, and when they find them, they can "shoot" them (through the screenshot on the phone) or "shoot".
Mania has admired the generation who played the game in a younger age, takes her out of the seats and the woman goes out looking for Pokémon.
In the United States, this game has resulted in a significant increase in the number of steps that an "average" person will take every day.
The Cardiogram app for smart Apple hours, which is followed by 35,000 users, recently announced for Washington Post that during two days since the game was played, the number of people who practiced every day for 30 minutes jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't have information about who Pokemon Go is playing - it only sees rough data about level exercises.
Many public campaigns aimed at "finding 30", "getting out of the couch" and "being active every day" fell on unnatural ground, because most public health-oriented messages are boring and targeted by people who do not look well.
However, the importance of exercise must not be underestimated.
Those who practice regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in weight control, high blood pressure, sugar and a long list of benefits that we cannot state here.
But the beauty of the game Pokémon Go lies in the fact that people go out and do something that they enjoy.
You cover three health pillars - movement, fresh air and sun umbrellas.
Some people get new friends even when they're hunting for their okemons.
As it is, they will find, of course, some boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And yes, someone can enter the door.
What about, like?
There's been a break.
In their time applications for smart phones, like Fitbit, were able to monitor our activity, but they didn't give us reason to do something like this in this game.
The news is being watched and an interest in it is beginning to fall at a certain point.
However, thanks to the success of the Pokémons, further games will emerge that will combine the application and virtual reality with activity in the real world and help a number of people pursue activity, health and better shape.

Simone Biles got gold in a lot of women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic to jump.
No scratches on the bet.
At the simples, everyone got it.
Excellent in everything.
And now finally the Olympic champion.
Nineteen-year-old American gymnast went on Thursday straight after the title in a multiple and the others on the full line under the Olympic reflectors won.
A total of 62,198 clearly confirmed her leap to the silver medalist and member of the final five team, Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aly Mustafin.
Simone Biles (USA) on Thursday during the event at the finals of several players in the sports gym at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American in a row that won more and the fifth in total when she confirmed her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps even the best at all.
When her overall final score was on the table and her long journey to the end of this moment, her face turned to tears.
This success ranks it into the same league of single athletes of their time as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to their sport:
Billes' sport for the last three years dominates, won 15 medals at the World Championships - including 10 gold. Its fascinating compositions are a mixture of ambitions and precision and the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton named it "the best gymnast she's ever seen."
The last test was waiting for her in Brazil, not between Biles and the rest of the race, but between her alone and the burden of too great expectations.
Anything other than returning home to your family in Spring, Texas, with a hand full of gold medals, would be considered a disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), left, and Aly Raisman are winning gold and silver medals in the finals of the women's multi-stakeholder in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
The first Billes won Tuesday, when she was a pilgrim in the celebration of the national team coordinators of Marty Karoli.
Billes insists that during her long journey to the summit, she never looked forward, but it's not so true.
The part of her composition in the simples - the one that contains her typical triple salt with a double turn - is placed in Latin music, which would just be suitable for home, in the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a battalion and her talent was discovered by the mother of coach Aimee Boorman on her way to the gym where Boorman trained and won.
The competition has not been lost in the multiple since 2013 - this is the result of a victory that can continue as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafin took over for a short lead due to two turns, it was just an illusion.
Cladina and simple - where Billes defends the world championship - are waiting.
She got back to the front with 15,433 points behind the curtain - and ended with 15,933 points in the loose.
Raisman gently hugged her when they were waiting for the final score - just formality - and around the sober red, white and blue shadows Biles discovered tears when the desires that she had once written as a child were fulfilled in her diary.
Raisman's performance was so little payback for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared the third match with Mustafina, then her bronze for the sum of three best compositions.
This time, the 20-year-old captain of the team, who the Americans call "grandmother," was quite ahead.
After her simples, she sent me an air kiss, capable of returning, which sometimes seemed unrealistic.
For Billes, the post that this nineteen-year-old athlete put on Twitter this week, where he became a complete hit, is a whole new issue:
Police: Three victims in the case of a serial killer shot when listening to music in the car
According to a police report published on Thursday, two women and a girl died during the 12-year-old's most important attack for decades in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix. They were shot while sitting in the car, talking and listening to music.
The authorities announced that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis Maleah's daughter were shot on June 12 in a car parked on the way.
The report states that the armed man stood on the side of the co-pilot and fired eight wounds from the handgun, then escaped in another vehicle.
Police say they don't deserve a triple murder because the attacker didn't take the wallets or the amount of $2,900 that one of his adult victims had.
Speaking police in Phoenix, Sergeant Jonathan Howard said the investigators were finding out if the shooting had any connection with any of the previous four attacks.
In two predominantly Spanish neighborhoods, there have been a total of nine attacks in four months, killing seven people and two others.
"It's happening in the villa district in front of the houses," Howard said earlier this month for the KPHO branch of the CBS station.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including the naked Nissan at the end of the 1990s, the black BMW at the end of the 1990s, and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was transferred to a hospital where she later suffered her injury.
Linear (31) and the daughter of Ellis Maleah died on the spot.
The witness told the police that it was not unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the murder, the target of which became an empty delivery only half an hour before a three-hour murder. Police believe that her source was this serial killer.
The investigators found the cartridges and from the rest of the bullets in the seat and from under the hood of the engine put the bullet together.
Mother of a six-year-old kid with a microcephaly: "His condition is improving"
Edmund Picciuto, like most children of his age, loves songs, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from microcephaly, which is the result of a genetic disorder his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, like the first time I thought I couldn't handle this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true at all - you said, "It is prepared for it."
She and her husband, Vincent, found out that Edmund might never be known and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that it be placed in the constitution.
"My first reaction was that I thought people were not doing this anymore," Picciutová explains.
Edmund's walking with a walk.
He wasn't supposed to sit down until he was three years old, and he's still not talking.
Some frontiers are already filling in slowly.
He comes with help and rides the bike.
He also enjoys playing with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth presents the sign of the word that Edmund says, "Please sing to me."
"We're teaching him the sign language," Picciutt told CBS News.
But it's not the usual sign language - he says Edmund invented some signs himself.
Microcephaly can occur from a number of different states: genetics, such as Edmund’s, and post-infection in pregnant viruses such as sleepwalkers or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary significantly.
It's too soon to tell us how Zika will affect the lives of the infected.
Picciut reminds us of the emotional tax he chooses for the future.
I keep asking myself, "What's next?"
What's next?
And she's still not sure about that.
Actually, I've never asked myself what the overall forecast is, because I don't expect anyone to tell me.
Picciut has an encouraging report for mothers of all children suffering from birth defects caused by Zika.
The situation is improving.
Think it'll be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and floods demanded rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and extensive floods in Louisiana led the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday. Another rain is expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Meteorological Service (NWS) has announced that after extreme precipitation, a number of rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and in southern Mississippi will spill out of their shores and threaten extensive flooding.
Governor Louisiana John Bel Edwards said that state officials are constantly in contact with local authorities and help is already on the way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesperson for the governor's office for national security and preparedness for the crisis situation, said they were receiving applications for water vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that only the county of Tangipahoe asked for 10,000 sandbags.
Water monitoring will remain in most southern Louisianas working on Saturday.
The weather service stated in the statement that it could spray up the sea for another about 8 to 13 centimeters.
In southern Alabama there was an emergency flood watch on Friday, when the rains continued in the area of the city of Mobile.
According to the predictions, the Baton Rouge and Amite Committees at Denham Springs have a weekend to culminate.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said that both said they could flood a number of homes in the suburban areas of Baton Rouge.
He further stated that there is a danger of flooding after stream in the Ascension district, when these distilled streams will flow to Lake Maurepas only slowly.
Tickfaw River, about something south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest recorded level by Friday at 9 a.m. local time.
Rescuers are still picking up people from the surrounding waters of Amite County and Wilkinson in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife, and his own son were already among those saved by Gloucester on Friday.
Hansford (62) said that the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 meters from his home, had risen quickly during the night.
He said that he had been warned by his own own son who lived nearby.
"We woke up and the water was getting closer," Hansford said.
We had it up to the belt.
According to his wife, it's the highest level she's ever lived on the river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said that he and all his family members are disabled and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford stated that crisis workers saved all three huge military-style trucks and moved them to a fire station in Gloster, where they stayed hidden on Friday.
Krautmann said that with the continuation of the beneficial rains, the floods are “emergence rapidly” and the authorities are considering evacuation.
According to Krautmann, the observer near Livinston reported that 35 centimeters of rain had fallen from midnight to morning.
Krautmann said that the ground was very busy from the middle.
The authorities have indicated that the excellent rain and paid roads have called for the rescue of residents from their homes during the period of Tangipahoe and the abolition of education in five school districts.
The branch of the CBS WWL station announced that 200 homes had been flooded according to an elder from Tangipahoe.
The residents were evacuated into two churches, both of which are now flooded.
The mayor of the village of Robby Miller said that the authorities saved 72 people and seven domestic animals that had been trapped by high water.
In the town of Amite and in the town of Hammond, shelters were set up for those who were evacuated.
"They will be able to return home when the water falls," he said.
In the area of Tangipahoe in Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed due to the flood, and local residents were given a sandbag that they could pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from water.
"The last big floods we had here in March," said the manager of Lacy Landrum.
Looks like these floods are gonna be similar.
Rupert Lacy, the crisis manager in Harrison County, Mississippi, said that on the coast of the Persian Gulf, there is still a persistent rain.
He said that on Thursday, a few homes were reported to be burned, but on Friday none of them were already reported.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in several places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - "a boy shot as solved", survived the shooting in Philadelphia
According to the police, a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, and this week he's already a second shot at a child six years old in town.
Her great-grandmother for CBS Philadelphia was identified as Mahaje Brown.
The parents say the boy suffered several gunshot wounds, including weakness, legs, thighs and stomachs, but when he was transported to the hospital, he was aware.
"He missed it very much, his small body was scattered as solved," said his grandmother Delores Melendez's station.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family for the station suggested that the boy be healed.
He was supposed to go to primary school.
Mahaj Brown is among the four people who were shot in the Germantown part.
Three more men were shot: two at the age of 29, and one at the age of 32.
One of the men at the age of 29 is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia there are two other victims in stabilized state.
According to the report of the station, the child was shot in the front seat of the vehicle along with a 20-year-old man in critical condition.
Two other victims weren't in the car, and the police are checking if any of the wounded men could be the shooter.
The investigators at CBS Philadelphia indicated that there was probably a gunman between several armed men.
On the site were fitted with weapons of an attack type belonging to a variety of weapons of attack.
It seems to me that it was certainly a continuing battle.
On the street there were trucks on both sides of the corridor.
It seems, therefore, that there were several armed combatants who were actively involved here," Fiddlef police captain Anthony Ginaldi said to the station.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also affected.
No one's been arrested, and the police are allegedly investigating video footage from the cameras.
Another six-year-old, this time a girl, was shot to death by a stray shot on Tuesday in front of a house near West Oak Lane.
The girl is recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That's how I imagine the women's team of gymnasiums for this year's Olympics, right now for a few reasons.
First of all, I've been at every summer Olympic since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second, in this team are three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired so many young colored girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which complements Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also confirmed the presence of blacks and Latin Americans at the top of this sport.
The gymnast number one in the past four years was an African American.
Simone and Gabby were last year at the first and second wives.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals suddenly became a champion of the Olympics and America won.
Now the world could be a witness to the incredible performance of the three-way world winners Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who performed unexpected but masterly gymnastic figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win gold in a womanly number of individuals.
And team member Aly Raisman got the silver.
We're witnesses of the sports summit, but in the hours of gymnastics in the country, it doesn't look like that.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie graduated to the Olympic team the same way as Aly and Madison.
They're "final five" because the team of gymnasiums for the next Olympics will be composed of only four athletes, and this is the last year Martha Caroly's training.
However, the reality is that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport and gymnastics are mainly trained in private gymnastics clubs that maintain parents who pay for training, equipment, travel, training, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their believers and their families).
Most of these sports clubs are in rich areas in suburban areas that can support activities.
These clubs have all the gymnasiums, and for the families of gymnasiums and gymnasiums it is a heavy and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach Laurie Hernandez, both trained athletes at the time they started high school.
It is our duty to bring gymnastics training that is more accessible and accessible to countless young girls communities that Simone, Gabby and Laurie inspired.
I set up a gymnastics grant 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free gymnastics or with low costs in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people within the city (primarily of Montenegrin and Hispanic origin) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) where we will provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and draw from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develop the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and mind-setting.
This combination means life benefits for good health, success at school and at work.
The inspiration of this team will send us thousands of young girls who want to do gymnastics, and that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for showing "wild force" and winning the Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls for all the reasons to go on the road to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal, young doctors are ready to join the post office
The ministers hoped that after the conclusion of the revised contract, the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would end the disagreement regarding changes, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who participated in the election refused the contract.
In July, Hunt discovered plans to conclude a contract with NHS being in "no one" and further delays would have a detrimental effect on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract, which includes changes in night and weekend work procedures to improve care in non-social hours.
Ellen McCourt, president of the BMA Committee for Young Doctors last night, stated: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that the current labour crisis will increase and therefore the fair treatment of all doctors.”
Only eight weeks before the first group of doctors enters the new contract, progress and time is needed.
The BMA's efforts to resolve the disputes through the negotiation met with the unwilling involvement of Dr and often with the deafening silence of the government.
And despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that this option is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt now has to act, push for expulsion and solve the concerns of young doctors."
If this is not the case, young doctors are prepared to take further steps.
During the last stop at the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed, as nurses and specialists were called to represent doctors who were among the Protestants.
Ministers hoped that after the conclusion of the revised contract, disagreements with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) regarding changes would be resolved.
BMA wants higher pay for the weekend for 54,000 young doctors who would be the subject of a contract.
Daniel Mortimer, president of the NHS employees, called on young doctors not to enter any posts.
Mortimer said: “The field action will achieve only a little or nothing, but there will be pressure on the already overloaded teams and services and will increase concerns, exhaustion and disruption for patients, treating staff and their families.”
In the past two months, we have dealt with the Council of Young Doctors and with the Ministry of Health, and the others have responded positively to their concerns about the role of surveillance and informant.
Employers hoped that continued positive involvement in other important issues - such as the burden, flexibility in training, further training for those who return after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study freedom and gender pay gap - was evidence of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health take agreements that were reached with BMA in November, February and May.
The medicine for 60 crowns per day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attack will be able to take a medicine that is recalculated to about sixty crowns (two pounds). The authorities recommend that it be given to more patients for a longer time.
Ticagrelor reduces the risk of seizures in people with heart disease.
The medicine is now being administered for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of death or other seizures.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the medicine be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Now, however, NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year, and one quarter of them suffer another stroke or heart attack.
The heart attack and death are caused by the accumulation of fat that forms a related layer on the wall of the artery.
If this layer is removed, a blood clot may occur, a blocking of blood access to the heart and a heart attack.
If the stroke is released, it can continue with the blood vessel, block the flow of blood into the brain, and cause the brain to die.
People who have already had a heart attack are exposed to a higher risk of further capture.
Ticagrelor, which manufactures the British company AstraZeneca and which is sold under the commercial name Brilice, reduces the risk of a less likely outbreak.
In the proposed NICE directive, which was published today, patients are recommended to receive 90 mg ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg with aspirin twice daily for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: “Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and who are affected by other heart attacks or deaths – often with devastating consequences.”
Fear of recurrence may have a significant negative impact on the quality of the patient’s life.
Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of other heart attacks and deaths in people who have already experienced an attack.
It is a pleasure to see that in the preliminary recommendation to Ticagrelor, we can extend the treatment opportunities that are available to many thousands of people who will be able to take care of it.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited over the three years period, the proposed treatment over this period is not recommended.
Computer culture began to foster fraud in Muslim areas
The mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year from office for corruption, which was linked to the government's report
The culture of political correctness has led to a review of widespread fraud in Muslim communities, as reported in the government today.
Former Minister Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticises the police, election inspectors and councillors for ignoring the abuse of the wills for "responsibility to ethnicity and religion".
The former secretary of the community, now the head of anti-corruption measures, said that fear of voters on the basis of their religion is so bad that the police should protect the co-ordinated and guarded voters from the polling stations.
He recommended that voters take the identity document with them and that they can prove who they are in the elections.
Currently, the elector is sufficient to enter his name and address.
In the report it is further proposed that the person’s fingers should be placed on the floor when the vote is given, in order to prevent a person from choosing twice.
Whistleblowers should have greater protection, says Pickles.
It requests that the press gain greater access to documents from the meetings and to decisions taken by the informal committees or the working groups.
"It is not only about protection against electoral fraud, but also about the protection of the local government from the widespread corruption environment and the financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report requested Downing Street as a result of the election scandal in Tower Hamlets in West London.
Last year, the special electoral court decided that the mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be removed from his post after charges of corruption and illegal practices.
The Court found that Rahman "cynically struck" the religious sentiment of his Muslim community and silenced his criticism of the accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
According to his words, Rahman “conducted his campaign in such a way that it was the religious duty of the devoted Muslims to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes were questioned or as a result of identity theft, when a person votes and issues from someone else.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern at the fraud in the corresponding vote - which the senior members of the Muslim community claimed to have put pressure on people during it to vote for the candidates they elected.
Sir Eric, on the video, gave several recommendations on how to clean up the electoral system, including presentation of identity document
His report states: “ Evidence was presented that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, were under pressure to vote in accordance with the will of the elders, especially in communities from Pakistan and Bangladesh.”
"There were concerns... that the state institutions had given way to such behaviour because of "politically correct" sensitivity to ethnic origin and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including to prevent political activists from being manipulated with a corresponding vote and thus to prevent the "debt of voices".
The report, which is now rated by Theresa May, also calls for more careful controls on registrations to prevent the use of electoral lists for immigration fraud and dose fraud.
Consider asking voters to submit a document of identity before the vote.
The use of an unspoilt fingerprint on the person's fingers when voting to prevent a person from choosing twice.
To carry out systematic checks on the nationality of persons in order to ensure that they are able to choose.
Requests for automatic correspondence shall be limited to a period of three years.
To prohibit political agitators and activists from manipulating their votes and electoral envelopes.
To give the police permission to create around the electorate of the cordon.
To amend the laws to make it easier to bring a person under the 1983 Reform Act.
To prohibit the taking of photos in polling stations.
To require that only English people (with the exception of Wales) work in polling places.
Strengthen training and ensure that employees comply with the rule that voters enter the polls individually.
Sir Eric criticises the London police and says it is "surprising", that in the case of Tower Hamlets no charges have been brought against them.
"The Court ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for the litany of corruption and illegal practices," he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty of having doubts about the basis of evidence of a criminal act.
It also criticises the inconsistency of "control of the markings" in the departments for registering the volleyballs at the council.
Sir Eric said: “Last Judgment of the Court in the case of Tower Hamlets awakening.
Our nation has a proud link to the collapse of parliamentary democracy, but the disturbing and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the status of rejection by some authorities threatens this reputation.
Consciousness of the cyclical double of the Duke Kate and other dubious personalities at the Rio Olympics
The fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics went mad this week at the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevotová, who is apparently like the Duke of Cambridge.
But the four-and-twenty-year-old Olympic is not far from the only athlete trying to make gold this year, who can boast of his own double of a number of well-known personalities - at least not according to social networks.
At the celebration of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous characters that currently appear on our screens, the column for women FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympics that are more than remotely similar to Hollywood celebrities.
As a hunting animal: A member of the U.S. team of shooters, Brady Ellison (left) was compared to Leonard DiCapri
In addition to Kate's two-way cyclist, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain shooter could be the twin of the star Leonard DiCapria.
A racer from the U.S. shooting team, Brady Ellison, caused a storm on Twitter after his pictures were invented, which may be like a Wall Street wolf.
Brady himself noticed the media madness and admitted that he was hearing about his similarities with Lee from a little girl.
"There's no big similarity for himself, except for your lips," Brady told Huffington Post.
"It's a mess and it looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be highlighted more this year: the imaginative image between the British jump to the distance of Greg Rutherford and the favorite actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliye Mustafine with her big, prominent eyes was said to be a copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, South Africa swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the star of the Gell Matthew Morrison series for several years.
And for change: The user thinks that Nathan is an "athletic version" actor from the movie Home (Inception)
Another long-term comparison is the comparison of the tennis star Rafael Nadal and the actors Josh Hartnett, who have similar dense eyes and lips.
Russian silver-plated Yulia Efimov boasts not only of the same skin breakfast and blonde hair as Annalyn McCord. And about Nathan Adrian from the U.S. team, fans say he looks like Joseph Gordon Levitt's "athletic version."
Women with power: Hope Solová (left) and Dexter Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar shape of face and eyes
Not only one: Twitter user was very pleased that the similarities were noticed
On waves theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for similar couples
One Twitter user recently said she was pleased that “the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solová and Jennifer Carpenter are really the same.”
Soccer star Hope Sol and actress of the Dexter Jennifer Carpenter series have a truly incredibly similar shape of face and eyes.
Among other favorite comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings's smile, which is almost identical with the smile of the actress Laura Linney, or the holder of the gold medal for Gabby Douglas gymnastics, boasting with her beautiful wide smile, which would copy the smile of Gabrielle Union, the stars of the movie Bravo, girls!
Commenter at the CBC station Olympics apologized for saying about the Chinese swimmer that she “blowed up”
The viewers of the medium live transmission from the Olympics at the CBC station sparked a debate about the performance of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan by Byron MacDonald. The swimming pool ended up in the fourth place of women's race at 4x200 m of free-style staff
The Canadian CBC station was forced to apologize for what one of its commentators said was that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer was "drawing like stink" and "blowing up" during the race.
Commenter Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when at the end of the final staff of women at 4x200 meters in a free style began to shake his own opinions.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring the CBC commentaries to the team, said, among other things, "The 14-year-old from China gave it up, you fool."
Too excited, she crawled like a stink, she exploded.
Thank you.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) sailed the second stage of the race at 1:57.79 - i.e. at 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck and allowed the Canadians to reach China.
The viewers in Canada began to quickly crawl online and were frightened by the tone and language that the commentator used
Emmett Macfarlane wrote on Twitter: "Did the voter on the CBC say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China "exploited"????
That idiot didn't notice he was still on the show."
Ai Yanhan from China at the Women's Staphyte Race Final at 4x200 metres in a free style was described as: "The little 14-year-old from China gave it up, you fool."
Criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came from all sides and many asked for his call
When Twitter users found out how insensitive Byron MacDonald is, they didn't stick back.
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and it sounds like we're a bunch of racists.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's living comment and said: "We apologize for the comment on the performance of the swimming pool that avoided sending."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened."
CBC finally apologized more than 90 times to the people who tweeted in response to the comment
Co-commentary Scott Russell must have apologized to MacDonald
CBC then copied and filed their apology for more than 90 Twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
The station also apologized and made a statement.
Honestly, she's sorry that the words were spoken, she shouldn't get into the ether.
We quickly apologized to our viewers in broadcasting and to those watching us on social media.
To make it clear, Byron's comments were about the performance of the swimming pool, not the swimming pool itself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unhappy choice of words. Byron is deeply sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized in live broadcast and tried to explain his remark by saying he didn't want to sound like a personal attack.
"I would now like to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's staff," he said in an olympiad broadcast at the CBC station.
"I had in mind the performance of the swimmer and not the person of the swimmer like that."
"There's no need to say that I didn't mean any disrespect and I'm very sorry."
Customers in Primark worsened by a woman who accidentally tried her underwear in the middle of the store
When the woman withdrew to try her pants in the middle of Primark's sales area, they were not buying a sure way to look.
To make it even worse, she tried to get her size down, put her pants on and put them back in the barn.
She continued her examination and finally tried four pairs of pants at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Flokeston.
Shop Primark at Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried her pants before returning them to the barn
Jenny Davidson’s mother, who was in the store at the time, said that after testing the underwear, the mysterious woman “dressed again and went out of the store without buying anything. ”
She said, "People couldn't believe it with their own eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store, took off the rag of her pants, put on her own stockings and pants, and put them on.
"She didn't even try to find a discreet place - just standing there, shaking like monkeys."
“Everyone just watched as the pants got back on, and obviously they didn’t like it, because they returned to the regalia.”
She did the same with three others before she finally decided she didn't like anything, got dressed again and left.
"She didn't seem to mind who she was looking at - not even thinking about the man who might buy the pants you tried."
Ms. Davidson (33), who lives in Kent, said: “This idea is that someone will take home a pair of pants that someone else had on himself and nobody cleaned them.
It happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: “When she left, I picked up things she obviously tried to pull them out of the sale – which is also the only right thing.”
"I'd be afraid to bring a new pair of pants home and find out that another woman was wearing them, took them off, and that they weren't washed."
Primark spokesperson said: “Primemark knows about the incident that occurred at our Folkeston store on Tuesday, 9 August.”
All the products concerned were downloaded from the sale.
How to Prevent Arms Attack by Krav Maga
The world out there is dangerous, but thanks to this video from Dailymail.com, it might be safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, the great federation of Krav Magica living in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers near the distance.
This video will show you how to suddenly gain an advantage over a violent man, whether he's getting close to you in the front or behind.
If you get close to the back, says Mizrachi, then the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and "have a free path shot".
Then you'll catch a weapon between your front and your shoulder just before you hit it in the face with a free bow.
Then he follows his knees to the weak, and while the attacker is in pain, you turn your weapon out of his hand, hit his head in his face, and begin to retreat, and you will hold your weapon against him.
If an armed man approaches you in front of you, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the fire line, grab the gun and kick it out so the doll can't shoot.
At the same time, put your force into the weapon and hit the attacker in the chest, then blow the weapon out of his armor and start retreating, while still resting on it.
Does it sound complicated?
Look at the video where you can see exactly how Misrachi does it.
Remember, however, that the safest way to get out of the fall - unless you are the great Krav Maga - is to give all the money.
Traveller Ian Wright Olyzes the Most Dirty Places in Europe to Travel Guide
The British traveller decided to undergo a difficult test of his immune system and deep reflection - olysizing the most dirty and disgusting places in Europe.
The moderator and the author of the Ian Wright (51), from Suffolk, added to the proof of the strength of his immune system a euro banknote in his language, a bar on Piccadilly Circus, a button on the toilet on the train and a Russian public phone.
He used the luminometer to show himself and all of us what he was going to do.
The experiment, based on which the movie Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed, however, brought interesting results.
The attack to lick the pressurizer on a train that has used thousands of other people may seem completely repulsive, but there are actually many more harmful bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his journey across Europe, Ian Wright spoke to doctors and health professionals about strengthening intestinal flora bacteria and his own health.
Luckily, none of what he smelled left him nothing worse than a taste.
Ian Wright celebrated himself by testing the strength of his stomachs on the roads around the world and by eating strange and wonderful things.
During this mission, his immune system tested completely safely - from public checkpoints at the train stations after the crash
In the film he recorded about it, he says: “I haven’t had much of my health since my childhood, and I’ve put everything I can into my mouth, from clay after eating worms and bubbling water.”
In the film, he confirmed his reputation as a dozaist.
All he refused were dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple beam, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4,000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should have less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia, but the Olympian declined after its luminometer showed more than 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy producers Valio recorded the passenger film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the bathroom
He said in the movie, "This is almost the worst thing I've ever felt in the toilet."
Nothing more dirty than this!
I'm not gonna say anything 'cause it's disgusting here.
Film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was recorded in cooperation with the Finnish producer of Valio dairy products.
Mr. Wright's company has provided Valio Gefilus, which contains bacteria of lactic acid and vitamins C and D, which help people strengthen the intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, senior vice president of Valio for nutrition, juice and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would follow the arrest and at the same time allow us to explain the benefits of the probiotics.
We've come up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended with the idea "let's call Ian."
It is said that the interest in stomach health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about producers, we wanted to put them into wider relationships - good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of stomach health and how it is connected to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy stomachs is a global phenomenon, and through this document we have brought more information to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think the movie reveals a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: “Let’s say this, Ian would lose my respect if he licked some of what I wanted after him – like the disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film.”
To lick some things was naturally easier for Ian, others quite difficult again.
I'm glad we made some of those dirty things."
Valio conducted a survey in 2015 that showed that 84 per cent of respondents combined lactic acid bacteria primarily with stomach and intestine health and 58 per cent of respondents indicated that at least occasionally they were using products containing lactic acid bacteria.
The family socially needed before moving destroyed the general building in Saltash, Cornwall
The family of the socially needy left at its general home the damage of 50,000 pounds after they were accused of terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were displaced from home in Saltash, Cornwall, after a number of complaints against them.
After their violent expulsion from the house, the officials of the housing company were shocked when they found out that the property was in an emergency state.
There were holes in the walls, the floor coverings were torn, the floors were covered everywhere on the floor, and the walls were numbered.
The family has already moved away and is considered to be living in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, the director of housing in Cornwall Houseing, said she was worried about going to the house to save.
She said: “It was a nightmare for people here, and I don’t think people should live like this.
A number of circumstances need to be considered, because this property is likely to be known as the "no so beautiful part" of Cornwall.
The family is not well-known and their names are not well-known.
A couple have three sons who lived in the house occasionally, and the police have indicated that the horrors of the family were the street fights using baseball bats, the intimidation of the surrounding people, the use of drugs, the distribution of drugs and the screaming of voices, fights and charges.
Skeldon (47) whose name was mentioned in the lease agreement was punished for anti-social behaviour in June.
In a few rooms in the house, which might be trashed, there were some interesting wastes.
In the house where drugs have been distributed in the past, the floor cover has been removed
Neighbors say they saw them on the street prowling, and people here regularly called the police
Cornwall Housing and her partner were forced to move out of the house this week after they had received an additional period of 11 weeks to move voluntarily.
The neighbors who were relieved welcomed the exiles with their lives being a living hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone at all."
We lived next to them for 20 years, and it's always been like this.
The many times we've seen the police here, they can't be counted at all.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because there was an incredible silence - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the supervisory manager of Cornwall Housing, stated that the family could not cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the police were regularly called home
Wastes and old toys are laid out in the fertile part of the present house
She adds: “It’s a shame that the tenant couldn’t accept responsibility for his own behavior and for the behavior of his family.
It was a very complicated case, because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to the witness, had to scare her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team has done, the Devon and Cornwall police and local community members who have been very well informed.
I hope that this step will bring some comfort to the neighbors and, at the same time, will convey the message that we will not tolerate non-social behaviour.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons of the tenants who lived in the house at different times were about 20 years old.

Workers will now have to dispose of wastes left around the house
In 2014, she carried out police in the Rasia house and found over 70 grams of hemp, weight, equipment and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon got a fine when she was found guilty of holding class B drugs she wanted to sell.
She claimed that the money was based on a house for her son, Lee Skeledon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is believed that Tanya and her partner are now living in private accommodation in Plymouth.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted graffiti.
Police say they'll try to move tenants who violate the rules of their rental contracts
Angela Crow from the Denov and Cornwall police indicated that the move was a clear message for other tenants who would continue to violate the rules.
"This is a message to all who think they can behave without punishment, and to those who want to follow such conduct," she said.
The Denov and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and non-social behaviour and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal scared after a low overflight of a military jet over the beach
Tourists who enjoyed the sunflowers in Portuguese Aveir were scared to death
Portuguese military flight P-3C Orion flew down to incredibly low
Military flight declared that it was a training flight and claimed that there was no safety threat.
At a time when the low-flying airtighter landed on the full beach, the frightened tourists panicked.
The dramatic footage shows how the military aircraft reaches almost a distance to the touch of the sun with people on the sandy beach near the city of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists began to wake up after they were disturbed by the noise of the jet engines without seeing what was coming out of the darkness.
There was an incident yesterday afternoon at Costa Nova near the city of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the few recruits who published video footage of a dramatic overflight on social networks, said: “The plane has flown really low twice, and at one point it seemed to disappear. ”
Nuno Arroya adds: “I was surfing, and I really thought the plane would fall on my head. ”
Tourists on the beach in Aveira were frightened when a low flying plane appeared out of the darkness
The Portuguese military flight today declared that the pilot of P-3C Orion was on a train flight to identify fishing vessels by the coast and had to be carried low because it was the only way to check ships.
The plane reportedly flew about something lower than usual due to the poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. However, the flight continues that the safety of the people was not threatened.
The forest fires destroyed part of the mainland Portugal this summer and claimed four victims on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese military flight today declared that the pilot had to fly low because of the dense fog and smoke from the fires that prevented him from seeing it.
The plane was on a train flight and the pilot was asked to identify fishing vessels as part of the training.
Half of the funeral services do not comply with the rules.
Half of the funeral service providers do not comply with the law.
The Czech Trade Inspectorate (ČOI) found this when checking in the second quarter.
According to it, the funeral services do not most often inform the others of their prices or issue written confirmations of the taking of the order.
ČOI paid 41 fines in total of 73,000 kroner.
Today, her spokesman, Jiří Fröhlich, was informed of this.
The inspectors have found a doubt at 47 out of 95.
In addition to non-informing prices and missing confirmations, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices other than those discussed.
In five cases, the products sold were not duly labelled and once the seller used an officially untested criterion.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of 7077 crowns.
It was about boxes of urns, candle covers and vases that were not properly marked with mandatory information.
"Since there is still a violation of the law in this specific area of services, the control action will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
The London schoolgirl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
It was reported that Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British schoolchildren who left London last year to join the IS, died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family learned about her death in the Syrian Rakce a few weeks ago.
On Thursday, ITV News reported that she was probably killed during the Russian air raid in Rakce, which is the garden of the group in the country.
Sultan was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just as she was preparing to flee the war of a troubled country and return to Britain.
"A man wants to believe that the only good thing about all that stuff - as a message and a warning to others that these are real dangers associated with the road to the war zone - is that he is helping people to make decisions from when to make them," Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other students from eastern London arrived on February 2015 on a plane to Turkey and then on a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan family learned that she had married an IS fighter in Syria and had been widowed for several months.
Reid says if Clinton is elected, he will leave Garland as the candidate of the Supreme Court.
The Senate leader on the democratic side of Harry Reid says he is convinced that the candidate for the presidential election for the Democrats Hillary Clinton appoints Judge Merrick Garland to the highest court in the event of his election.
The Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment, even though its President Barack Obama nominated already in March.
The Senate leader Mitch McConnel says that the person who replaces the deceased judge of the Supreme Court will elect the future president.
During the conference call on Thursday, Reid announced that Clinton was believed to be choosing Garland “with a certain degree of confidentiality”.
Reid's spokesperson later said he didn't talk to Clinton directly about whether Garland would name Garland and only speculated.
He assessed Garland and said that the Clinton team would not want to "understand the ship" by someone else's choice.
Garland is the president of the federal appeal court in Washington.
Reid said that the republics that block Garland's appointment are "obligators" and "shopping" of the Republican candidate to the presidential office of Donald Trump.
He said Trump didn't fit into the office.
According to the magazine Treats are our calendars for “wives and men”
The magazine Treats collaborates closely with photographer David Bellemer to issue a calendar for 2017, inspired by Pirelli's 70's calendar.
But instead of discovered famous personalities, try to find another generation of top models for their 2017 calendar.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine was full of rumors from the old school, because "Playboy is for men."
I do it for women.
Obviously, the calendar is thought to be too.
“We need to return to showing overtime and classic hints when women and men are pleasantly feeling and are being inspired by photographs of the woman’s body,” Shaw said in a press release to issue a calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a wonderful piece of art.
Models can send their pictures online or personally during open competitions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where does he direct the vinyl: who really buys the phonograph records?
Vinyl loves the isolation of men in the Middle Ages.
Before you decide to pay for the Section of Comments with pepper notes under the pseudonym No.All AloneMenIn the Middle Ages, we note that this sentence is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, so much debated the resurrection of gramophone boards is linked not to the boom of millennials who want to love the original property of the physical object, but to the nostalgia of the Middle Ages.
Those who recently bought their vinyl album are the most likely people between 45 and 54 years of age.
Young people 18-24 are the least likely.
It's not really about the gathering of a excited fan - it's all about the emotional dimension: older people who buy gramophone records, probably want to keep their feelings (56%) versus 53%, and they like to be alone (69% versus 66%).
But are your results true?
If this blog was broadcast as a television report, a camera would follow me as I go out into the trashy street in Soho, dressed in a decent grey dress and gestiqued widely. Then I would stop, pull out my hands and say something authoritative, like, "So let's go and look at it."
Let's take a look at this.
While from Soho's heart his charm and magic is slowly lost - buildings once occupied by independent sellers, hotels, restaurants and restaurants, packaging and office needs are now filled - a few fantastic specialized trades with Gramophone boards remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a moment.
Stuart (55), a relative from Glasgow, whom I follow from Sister Ray (numbers: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (numbers: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20) has a afternoon meeting in London and looks at the shops to complete a few hours of time.
I'm asking him if he's a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I've got three or four thousand recordings.
All these tapes lick the walls of his living room - on the picture above (he sent me an e-mail, I didn't follow him home).
This huge amount of albums and singles also has because they can afford it: they can now buy gramophone records that they couldn't afford when they came out, and they buy what they sold in their youth and didn't even have a vendetta.
“Many of what I buy is from the end of the 60s and from the beginning of the 70s. These are things that would be published when I was 11 or 12. At that time I was too small and couldn’t fix them,” he says.
They agree that those who buy records are probably introverts who love their own company and say: “I don’t smoke or drink.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works in Sister Ray, and she also thinks that a number of customers she meets fall into the profile of YouGov.
He also noticed a new flood of people affected by the media wave. People who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy their old phonograph records back.
According to my interviews, the people of their collections were most often released between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their gramophone records and bought a CD now sell their CD to buy their gramophone records back," he says.
That could explain the boom of lovers of gramophone boards of a certain age.
But what about the emotional importance of the gramophone boards?
It won't take you more than a few seconds to find out in a store like Phonica that in a music store you will find a pleasant community of people with similar thoughts.
According to Weze, some older customers are particularly affected by the non-contact payment system.
In the digital world, some gramophone tablet beneficiaries may feel numbered and have decided for the familiar environment of the gramophone board packages, things that cause memories of peaceful adulthood.
"I think that filling a gap or property of something substantial can bring some comfort," Wez says.
I'm a collector myself, and I think a lot of people do.
It's an easy way to fill a place in your head.
"We are all like their social workers!" says a collaborator from a collection of gramophone boards.
In April, an ICM survey revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought their vinyl album a month ago had not heard it.
According to the survey, 41 % of the surveyed Gramophones never use, while 7 % of those who buy Gramophones do not have Gramophones.
At this point of the report, he was probably really worried about going through a bunch of compilation bosses new.
The aspect of "trophy" and the revitalization of interest is something Jonny (42), who works in Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men).
"Someone recently came and said, "I don't have a gramophone yet, but I want to buy on the radiohead board so we can put it on the counter," he says.
That's not a big percentage of them, but it's what happens.
It's more about the product page than about the music.
People come to us who say, "I don't have a gramophone."
They're younger people, not the older, grown-ups who get into it.
Fopp, where at the present time almost one in four is replaced by a gramophone board, has many different visitors at my arrival.
There are a couple of 70s, tourists who take pictures, pubs and women of the Middle Ages.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as the shops before - from the speakers instead of the dazzling jazz, the latest pop from Wild Beasts full of synthesizers and sex, it is good to see different customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but you will find it hard to estimate an intrusive mental trauma when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) takes a few minutes in Fopp and looks at various Gramophone records in the discount.
He's one of those people who's looking at their expenses rather than running out of heat.
According to his own words, he doesn't make much money, so he doesn't seem to think he's picking up the phonograph records.
It's worth a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something, but the gramophone records have their magic... ."
I can't explain it. It's unique.
My last stop is a store that supposedly inspired a new generation of gramophone board lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I look like I'm very interested in girls in fancy jeans, and I'm following a bunch of pretty-year-old girls who just hang out around Polaroid cameras, and then their father and daughter are deciding to buy Crosley's gramophone.
On the left is the hall whose walls cover the Gramophone Boards Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Maca: a mix of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average collection of Gramophone Boards.
No one is looking at them - perhaps just because they're just for decoration and some are so high on the wall that they can't be reached.
It's a pure "wine trick."
But since any attraction to him could mean more money for the industry and send several customers to the depth of Soho for the next, there's nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that the demographic area, where there is probably more time and money than in other areas, is also the one where the most expensive goods the vinyl is.
But while I find that the results of YouGov are accurate - at least in transactions with gramophone boards, they do not take into account a large number of collectors and lovers of vinyl who actually exist, in transactions with gramophone boards and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
He certainly does not spend the Thursday morning wandering after trades with the Gramophone Boards on Berwick Street, passing recordings, and avoiding the sight of a strange, thirty-year-old fake TV moderator hiding behind the back of the middle-aged ignorant men.
Granny shark is the longest living helicopter - video report
According to scientists, the gronal shark has the longest average life span of all orbiters on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says that the recording shows a female whose age is estimated between 272 and 512 years and measures five meters
Court in France refused to shut down trades in the Jungle refugee camp
The Court in France rejected an order from the authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During the trial this week, the authorities in Calais suggested that the state should be able to cancel a total of 72 temporary shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes after energy drinks, offer hair cuts, sell tea for 50 cents or basic meals for several euros in the provisional restaurants.
The Prefect's office in Calais argued that places need to be destroyed because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they pose a danger to fire and health risks.
The humanitarian organisations of the court have stated that shops and restaurants are vital and that food that is provided free of charge by the state-supported associations and other groups does not provide food supplementation for the growing numbers of refugees in the camp.
Disputed provisional shops and restaurants often provide shelter and food for people in need.
The Lille Court ruled that there was no legal basis to prevent the people from operating 72 provisional transactions, but stated that the objections of Prefect Calais are "very understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food sales, cafes and restaurants have a much greater role than just feeding people who are “living under extremely desperate conditions.”
He said that spaces provide peaceful places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places where demolished was a café in the camp, Jungle Book Kids, which is operated by a non-profit organization and which daily offers 200 meals, hours of English and French and asylum advice for hundreds of endangered minors without escort to the camp.
The petition for the protection of the "child's" coffee shop signed more than 170,000 people.
The Guardian received a letter stating that the closure of the café “was a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old.”
The charity Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of refugees in the camp after a sharp increase in arrivals over the years has grown to more than 9,000 - which is the most throughout the period.
You thought he was dead.
The wolf crosses himself and the volleyball mouth.
"From March I was able to train normally," he reported on the start of summer preparation in full strength.
What's the matter with you?
I had a double lung embolism, then because of heart problems.
Because when I was at a university in Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So he made a long flight to Asia?
For two years, I had a stroke, and I didn't know about it.
It hurt me. No one found me.
Then the crash got up.
There's a destroyed life in the summer, and it's gonna hurt all the time, especially when the weather changes or the weather changes.
But nothing that would limit me would be more aesthetic.
Were you worried about life?
He did.
I didn't know I had embolism last year at the summer tournament in the Woods, and I couldn't even move there anymore.
I threw the blood tonight.
Doctors told me it was something completely different. I've been fully equipped for five more days.
I actually thought I was dead in the Woods, my girlfriend and my family.
I've seen myself somewhere else.
How'd you compare that?
I guess I had to live through it, and now it's just going to go up.
I know I have some blood problems that I need to be more careful when I'm going somewhere.
But you can do anything about it.
Even when I wanted to get back to prep last year, there were problems with my heart.
It's all right now.
Since March, I have been preparing for home alone to be able to play again.
I'll lock it up. I'm physically better at it than before.
What do you expect from the mouth?
I'm glad the party looks good, most guys I know.
I'm curious about two other foreigners coming.
Well, I hope we're gonna sit down with the people to fit in with us.
Will you raise your mouth?
She had a reputation as an opener, but every season is different.
Brno was eight two years ago, now the second is over.
There's a new team in the Ust, only a few players left.
It was the last in extralization, so there's a big room for improvement.
If we use it, it's up to us.
We'll see after the first rounds who's gonna be the opening, we don't.
Is it a guarantee of success to watch Brom?
He's already experienced and he's experienced a lot, he'll think of a better place than the last place.
But my coming didn't have anything to do with it. I made a deal earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, I'm a big friend with one, and it was agreed that it would work here.
I won't say a name.
Mr. Brom finally came, and I'm glad.
He's got a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's been training for decades, he's a former good player.
Move us up.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to joke, and I like to get an opportunity in a not-so-peak team.
I've been in Pribramy for two years, but Ústí is a bigger challenge than being on the sixth team right now, because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned foreigners, Australian Boehm is already training in Usta.
What does it look like?
I know him by the way, we played against each other at the university in a group.
And a couple of times we had fun together, sometimes we sat together after the games, so we already know each other friends.
We beat them 3:1, and I immediately put it in his mouth at the start of the summer.
He's a good friend of his.
American Nadazdin and Brazilian Ze will still arrive.
Do you know anything about them?
I wrote with an American, he looks like a good guy, a Brazilian guy who knows how to learn English.
You contacted the American?
I thought it was a good idea.
I'm a recorder, so whoever makes it, I should communicate with everyone.
I just found out what the player is, found myself on the Internet playing, saw some videos.
He showed up all right, kid jumper, he's tall.
We wrote a few stories on Facebook, he seemed like a joke, he'd come to us.
How do you feel about the recording unit position?
I didn't want to take anything else.
I'm only going to be 40 years old, and I don't have the right to go to bed.
I'd rather be in the center of the event, I'd rather run a team than be run by someone else.
I don't think I'd want to play again if I were to be like a second recorder and devote myself to it for the full time.
How many times have you been a single?
Half in Pribram when it didn't go to Kusto as a captain, he got hurt, then there were money problems and he left.
Since then, we've been climbing up and I've been playing.
In Brno, where I'm a remand, I've crossed a unit and a pair.
An excellent year was in Old Town, after which I had a lot of offers and I just chose Priíbram.
From there, Budjejovice wanted me, I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new start.
Gold number 22.
The short cover remains Phelps domain.
"To be back on the stage winners and hear the hymn is sweet as always," laughed Phelps and then again had eyes full of tears.
His fiancée and mother once again chirped in the audience, the son of Boomer this time slept quietly with his ears.
I'm going through an unrealistic week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago I started racing and in a couple of hours it'll be after everything, said my aunt.
In the final after Phelps for almost two seconds, a silvery Japanese Kosuke Hagino won a long pillow.
Bronz won Chinese Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from the last world championship.
After Alu Oerter (disk) and Carl Lewis (distant) Michael Phelps is the third sportsman who has mastered the same discipline in four games.
After most of the race with Phelps, another American Ryan Lochte and home Thiago Perreira took the lead.
While the gold defenders in the final crusader's fifties set to a sober finish, they fell out of the medal.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance in Rio to expand its unique medal collection.
Shortly after the celebration announcement, he went to the final race for 100 metres of motorcycles.
The legend could not even be obscured by the countryman Ryan Murphy, who won the brand double - after a hundred years he won a double track in Rio.
In the final, he left behind 37 sets of Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin, the third ending of Russian Jevgenij Rylov.
While Murphy has only the fifth place from the world's last championship, in Rio he becomes a marker king.
From an imaginary throne, Larkin, who succeeded in the same double just on the last world championship.
But at the Olympics, he won the medal right now.
In the Crawling Stone, the Canadian Penny Oleksiakov and the American Simone Manuel shared the gold.
For sixteen-year-old Oleksiakov, it was the fourth medal in these games, for Manuel's second silver from the staff.
Sailing gold won the OH as the first African American in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
This medal is for everyone who comes after me, sports will become their love and they will get to where I am, said Touched Manuel.
The third was Swedish Sarah Sjöström, who won a 100-metre motorcycle race in Rio in the world record, and still has silver from the Kraular Double.
By the time the sixth world record was finished, Australian Cate Campbell.
Japan's Rie Kanet won the press double, for which it was the first Olympic medal in 70 years.
There is no precious metal, not from the world's championship, and its maximum was the fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Rio was won by Ruska Julia Jefimov, who, due to the start of the games in spite of the doping past, is faced with the inanimateity of the spectators and the rival.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won the courthouse, and I don't know why I should always answer these questions.
I'm so tired of it, the Russian swimmer said.
The right to start in Rio succeeded until the special panel of sports arbitrations CAS just before the start of the game.
They took care of my calls, and I won.
If someone likes it or doesn't like it, or if he has a different opinion, whether he's referring to an arbitral tribunal, she added.
Hermann: Disappointment, we could win.
And start at midnight?
I don't remember.
The Czechs have experienced a special day.
Only an hour before the game, they found out who they'd be up against.
They must've managed tactically.
And then, in untraditional times, the little court game number one started.
The first set didn't start well, then they pulled up the opponent's jump, but at 19:19, they couldn't handle the final.
In the second, they were clearly better and compared, but the decisive tie-break did not come out.
Above all, a number of the services shown meant losing 10:15 and leaving with the Olympic tournament.
"We could defeat the Russians," Hermann said regretfully.
How would you assess the match?
Hermann: After the unfortunate start before I played, we got pretty into the game.
At the end of the last balloon, I got the receipt I used to get used to.
We lost a hundred of them, which was key.
In another set, we came up against them with a view of the playground, another defense, and we pushed on the service.
There was a lot of damage in the tea break, and we got dressed up on this page.
It was a disappointment because we could defeat the Russians.
Bad start of the first set, that's where we ran away.
We were able to pull it off, but we missed the points.
The second set was great, and in the third, he decided to serve.
We made too many mistakes.
We gave them five points, and that was about the five, and we got a lot in there.
It's a pity the Russians were playable.
How did you play at the little castle number one?
Sluková: Similar to in China in the adjacent courtyards.
The media and the atmosphere were different.
There was an hour in the night, full silence, music didn't play, nowhere.
It was the difference between the center and the center.
We wouldn't choose such conditions, but we can't choose.
What was the preparation for the match when you found out the names of the matchmate an hour before the match?
Hermann: She was special.
We started playing games without knowing the players, so we couldn't make tactical preparations like for the other teams.
But Simon (Nausch's wheel) came up with tactics almost on all the possibilities that were there.
He had prepared a lot of paper with tactics, so on this page we were quite well prepared.
Do you remember ever starting a game at midnight?
Hermann: I guess not.
We played at half eleven, but not at twelve.
Rusky Birlov's block in the prechole play-off on OH in Rio.
Beach volleyballists Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermann in the suburbs of the play-off on OH in Rio.
Was it unpleasant?
Luckily: By playing the last two games in the group since the tenth, we had a regime that had been moved before.
This was two more hours.
It's strange, I can't imagine that another sport has a sportsman who has to give his best performance in twelve hours.
But I think we've prepared the best we could.
We knew it would, but it's not completely typical and it's probably not gonna be my favorite time to play.
How do you measure your Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the process of our target group was on one side, it's fine.
We did what we said.
But now I'm sad after the game.
Sluková: I will get out of it and from tomorrow I will remember the Olympic tournament only positively.
Big brother's here. First SIM is coming.
You won't escape her.
The new rules should apply to all persons without a Thai passport who, when staying in Thailand, decide to arrange a SIM of one of the local operators.
So not only for tourists, but also for people with long-term visas that work in Thailand, for example, or close marriage there.
The Secretary-General of the Office of National Broadcasting and the Telecommunications Commission Takarn Tantasith informed that there would be no exceptions.
The SIM sales plan for exclusively targeted foreigners was presented by the national telecommunications regulator at the beginning of August.
New measures to allow monitoring of their position shall be taken by the authorities within six months.
According to Tantasith, it is a means of maintaining national security, which will enable the criminal activity to be handled by the wrong of foreigners.
In addition, so-called tourist SIM should help discover persons who exceed the permitted duration of their stay.
In the case of sellers, a special SIM for foreigners should also be discovered on the SIM side intended exclusively for Thais within half a year.
The difference will be precisely the monitoring function that will be permanently enabled for maps for individuals without Thai passports.
It won't be possible to turn it off.
"This function for SIM for Thai is not because you can always be easily monitored," Tantasith added.
It should be added that prepayments in Thailand are not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires proof of identity.
On the other hand, for several years one of the operators was giving free launch SIM to tourists at airports.
You were so completely anonymous.
The imposition of the same measure as Thailand also takes into account ten telecommunications regulators from other Asian countries including Malaysia or Singapore, for example.
Even at present, mandatory SIM registrations apply, but the legal use of the monitoring system is not possible.
However, the measures envisaged do not mean that a foreign person is obliged to arrange when entering the country of the local operator's SIM.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be brief.
Operators of the country concerned shall only know the relevant network information after the border has been crossed, i.e. after the SIM has been entered into their network.
So they know the phone number, but they don't know the owner's information.
However, the difference between roaming prices and rates of local operators is so devastating that during their stay in Thailand, most tourists start looking at local SIMs.
The efforts of the authorities to supervise the movement of foreigners have been legally criticized by foreigners living in Thailand.
The Tantasith situation calms down and, in relation to privacy protection, the system will compare to the obligation to provide a residence address in immigration documents.
In addition, the police will need a court order where necessary to monitor a particular person.
For any abuse of the system, a punishment that is not defined will be threatened.
"If the service provider follows the SIM position without a court order, he will be charged with a criminal offence," Tantasith added.
The system should also maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While there is currently a recycling of a specific number until after the 90-day period after which the SIM has not entered the network, the new version of the number could be restored after fifteen days in the event of the release of Thailand.
Luxury apartment in the new building in Vinohradech has a swimming pool and a whirlpool on the terrace.
Why did you choose the apartment in the new building?
We've been looking for a carefree apartment where most of the property is owned by the manager.
The condition was sufficient parking spaces and lifts in the house, which basically disqualified the older building.
Not about the problem acoustics in old homes, the problems with flooring, high energy stresses, and so on.
There were also large terraces, which the old building is not able to offer.
Further interesting visits will be found in the journal Modern Apartment.
The entire interior was designed for you by architect Lenka Langer and his colleague Kamou Polákov from Artiga.
Why did you just address them?
Would you recommend working with each expert?
We would recommend cooperation with the architect to everyone if he proposed the apartment from the beginning, because it is a very complex technical process.
The second level is the interior design itself: designers have a much better idea of the scale of possible materials and on the basis of the customer's wishes are able to suit the interior.
With architect Lenka Langer we have already worked together on our mountain apartment, then on the basis of the personal recommendation of another client, and since everything worked well, there was a clear choice for us even when we rebuilt our new apartment in Vinohradech.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a large community-dwelling space with suitable ground for a four-member family, which is described as a modern, but not a cold interior.
The priority was to connect the apartment with the terraces and implement intelligent household control.
Of course, the quality of the work had to be cleared.
Did you leave everything at the expert level, or did you interfere with the final form of the interior?
We have approved all proposals, including technical drawings and samples of materials, but the proposal has always been taken from architects.
At first, we've determined what we expect from the design, and we've shown some elements of the interior that we'd like to join in the proposal, for example, the cover or the picture.
I think that our collection of mostly Czech authors including works by Karl Malicha, Karla Vysuhil, Václav Spala or Otto Gutfreund architects helped guide us in our taste.
The combination of black, white and ore wood was also the idea of architects as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floors, lighting, blankets, textiles, art etc. We then jointly verified with visualization.
Did they come up with any complications that led you to give up your original ideas or join the new ones?
Probably only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the building at a time when it was possible to get to the top of our floor, and found that the views we were planning really shadowing the surrounding building.
Then we literally changed the disposition over the night from the base.
On the kitchen line and on the roof of the creek wall, a jaundice was used.
The interior is then dominated by wooden surfaces filled with skin, for example, by the cooking of Norma’s food and bar chairs from Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you going to make any changes or is there something you'd like to have today?
I mean, it's a modern air interior, which, above all, meets its purpose.
We do not intend to change, most of the adjustments after the move took place in the level of shade and the accommodation of the terraces.
Perhaps the only impression is on the floor when the nut tree appears to us as too clever in the home with the dog.
The word architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornychová, the authors of the realization.
The apartment is in the last floor of the new building, so it was possible to carry out a completely new solution and several other adjustments within the building.
For the interior, it is an important element in the placement of the lamps into the ceiling of the hall and the main toilet.
That's how we got daylight into the darker rooms of the apartment.
The direct entrance from the main bathroom on the roof terrace to the pool from the USSSPA is also one of the construction arrangements that was very beneficial for the function of the entire apartment.
The part is also a swimming pool and a fork.
Compared to France, you are not negative, says a Muslim living in Prague.
You're from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are from Algeria.
I was born in southern France, a bit from the Spanish border.
I've moved quite a bit.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
In France, I studied journalism, which led me to work in one magazine.
So why did you decide to move out of the country?
I started to feel like I was breathing in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Mostly because of the atmosphere between people.
I thought every Frenchman was very negative.
People in France are negatively charged in general, but it's been getting worse lately.
It's interesting that you're just referring to negatism.
Some people will appreciate the Czech character like this.
Believe me, compared to France, you're not negative.
Some people don't come so far when they come to France because they don't see it as such a tourist.
But it was too much for me.
A big issue is money.
People feel they have little money, while the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which I think is enough.
Now there's also a problem with people's behaviour towards Muslims.
That's completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbor started looking through my fingers just because I was a Muslim.
It's like I'm some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel good in France.
My family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for a job basically anywhere else and I went to a free place with Air France here in Prague.
I admit I didn't even know Prague from the beginning.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my dad even told me what was going on in Czechoslovakia, but I didn't know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here for three years now, and I can't imagine being here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't catch any negative reactions or tasks, but I feel like people here are more freer.
That I can do anything, dress anyway, and no one's gonna judge me.
In France, someone is always looking at you uncomfortablely, even if you have special clothes and something like that.
I started to feel really free in Prague.
I don't think that's what I'm looking for.
Where do you work now?
After working in Air France, I worked for one travel website for a while.
Then another friend and I started websites that people are offering and searching for shared housing.
So far, we are only in Prague, but we would like to extend it to Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here who are Czechs from half, and two other Czech friends.
I have to say that the other specificity of the Czechs is that at first they keep more distance.
He won't let anyone in right now.
That's pretty different from where I grew up.
Everyone in the south hugs and kisses their face.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural matter, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned you don't speak Czech.
Is language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, I have a lot of simplicity in Prague, because everyone here speaks English.
Even in parties or in food.
I'd like to learn Czech, but I don't have that much time.
And by having everyone communicate at least a little bit in English, I don't need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who can help me.
Have you even met with some negative reactions?
Maybe because you're a Muslim?
Not really.
Maybe it's also by working in an international environment that's more tolerant.
One experience is coming at me.
My leader, the Czech, once told me about the French football team and said something in the sense that they are not French, but Africans.
That touched me pretty much.
But if someone had a problem with being a Muslim, I haven't had one yet.
And yet my colleague once reminded me of some anti-Muslim demonstration.
He said don't let me go to the center and they'll give it to me.
Anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly related to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Do you fear that something like Paris, Nice or Brussels can happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, today can happen anywhere.
I don't think I've ever been able to imagine anything like this happening in France before.
And it's not just about Muslims.
Moreover, Islam does not know violence at all.
For me, the people who kill are not Muslims.
The Koran says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel when terrorists protect your faith?
It's very difficult.
I feel cold and guilty, even though I shouldn't feel that way at all.
I try not to follow the reports of violence, but every time I read something, I need to apologize for something that's not really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for the terrorists?
We met at the site of Jiří from Podebrad.
On the middle of the day, the common Muslim group with Christians protested against violence.
Did you record it?
I didn't know about that.
But I understand that people feel the need to prove that they don't agree with violence.
I don't think they'd have to do something like that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they haven't done?
Do you meet with other Muslims in Prague?
My collaborators, for example, are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They're a little more religious than I am, so sometimes we have a pretty wild discussion about Islam, because we all think it's a little different.
I'm from France, so I went through other education, they must have been taught Islam at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with a woman's subordinate status.
How do you feel?
I don't look like a subordinate in any way.
On the contrary.
I'm a woman, I'm strong.
It also means you don't wear any head coverings.
Like hijabs?
And it's signed mostly the way I was raised.
My mother, for example, is a very fundamental Muslim.
They pray five times a day, but the dress just doesn't wear.
She always taught me that faith is a purely personal matter.
It depends on how everyone interprets it.
When a person reads the Koran, he should have his own opinion on those things.
So when I read in the Koran a passage that says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from others, I said to myself, "I am not the Prophet's wife, so why should I hide?"
On the other hand, I respect it, and if I go to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where the dress is required, I'll take it.
Are you planning on staying in Prague?
So far, yes.
I didn't feel so good anywhere else.
I've been thinking about Poland for a while, but it's great in Prague.
I'm even going to introduce myself to raising my own kids here.
I think Prague is the ideal city for it.
The Czech Muslims, along with the Christians, demonstrated against violence.
The Kozelsko Fencl wind in Rio hit the promenades.
Friday's voyages to the sea in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro were carried out by Czech hunters Veronica Kozelské Fenclová.
The Laser Radial class moved ahead of the final two rides to the tenth place.
That would ensure Czech participation in the final drive.
You pick up the pills like peaches.
They want to compete with the carriers.
The idea of using the routes already planned for the transport of the shipments is the TV director Matej Liška and the manager of the Prague Music Club Marek Greger.
The idea was to breathe life into three different applications with different geographical ranges.
The national transfer application was released in May.
There are thousands of cities and networks in it right now.
In the Czech Republic, we first want to learn this before we focus more on abroad, says an IDNES.cz 40-year-old manager in the interview.
How does the Transfer app work and which one of them can benefit?
You'll download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and the details of how large a package you can carry and how much you want.
Someone might be asking for transportation that day again.
When the route and delivery time meet, it is disputed and mutual notification will come.
At the moment, the chat will open, where the two will arrange their transmission.
How many people do you think it takes to register for each package to always find its courier?
I don't know the ideal condition, I can't figure out how many registered and how many roads it takes to make the coverage completely optimal and every offer was in dispute with the demand.
It's already working on the main roofs, and it's logically simpler than it is on the way between villages.
The more people, the more the potential of speed and accuracy.
People are also building their trust and finding that nobody is running away with the package.
So far, you didn't have to solve a case like that?
How many users have service after two months of release?
At the moment, we have between 5,000 and 6,000 people who make their way.
We consider it a success, and we believe they're going to pack up another.
Doesn't the sender have to wait too long?
We hope that we will be competitive for large conglomerates only because we are able to deliver the matter on the same day and for the price break.
In the big company for delivery within two hours, you will pay several thousand.
You'll have to pay a hundred or less here because it's the way someone's already doing.
Should traditional carriers fear the possible loss of customers in the future?
We hope so.
The market has enormous potential, there are huge transnational carriers feeding, as well as commercial chains, where everyone started to buy and gradually found that quality does not correspond to what they are paying for.
No one wants to find in the ticket box with a message that he has to pick up the shipment on the sidewalk, that's the first day after 19 o'clock.
At the time, I needed the package for six hours and waited at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that won't hurt anyone and send out a competition signal to try.
Marek Gregor (41) and Matej Liška (39).
Not one of them has ever been involved in information technology.
Marek Greger works as a music club manager, Matej Liška as a television director.
In 2014, they started to prepare the LTD Shippancee application, which uses the routes already planned between the world metropolises, especially the aircraft.
In 2015 they launched a project to process a company that created applications for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming lasted three quarters of the year and the applications were placed on the market in March 2016.
The transfer application began to develop in December last year and was released this year in May.
This is a local version of Shippanese adjusted for the Czech market.
The applications Mesík and Mesík Profi developed since this year's January and made it available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was to make all these applications that one day merge into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to postpone the application and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, focus more on the world market.
The shared economy has been a topic lately and this is an AirBnB or Uber service.
Don't you have any concerns about action in a field that no one can say so far, where is the border between sharing and where is the shadow of the economy?
It's the same, just another product.
It is clear to us that if it succeeds and we go up with it, we will be looking at another step through the shadow economy.
But even if someone saves and wins, it's not the intention of consulting financial institutions and tax controls.
Each user, whether on one side or the other, will be offered to pay his or her income if he or she does so.
What makes you think the service has such a potential?
The consignor will save and the carrier will earn and reduce the costs of the journey respectively.
That's the strong idea that connects interest on both sides.
In the time of the social networks that divide people, we'd like this one to get closer.
Good stories can arise, people are happy to help someone, and they'll tell themselves about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
I think people have been missing personal access for a long time, and we say that this application is a service to people.
How, then, do you guarantee that the courier with the package won't run away?
Each user of the application together with the registration shall draw up a civil certificate and enter a bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are the channels that give the service and the credibility of man.
The couriers also collect the stars on the basis of an assessment of the transmitters.
We'll also offer insurance, we're still getting the details.
For uninsured consignments in the event of loss or damage, the courier shall hold the charge, but shall not accept responsibility under criminal law for the content if there is any illegal inside and does not know about it.
If the police stop him and find him in a closed package in his pocket, or ten kilos of paper, he will be liable to the consignor.
Is there any danger of misuse of sensitive database data?
Where necessary, they shall be registered by the supervisory authority which, as the only one, will be able to look into it, nor are we able to see it ourselves, the data shall be protected against abuse.
How much money will the courier get after successful delivery?
The courier shall determine the price and shall obtain the full amount he will claim.
The dispatcher shall charge a few percent additionally by means of contact.
This money is our profit, but it's just a few percent because we want to push the volume.
Neither can the courier claim that he did not add the consignment when he actually delivered it, the acquisition and delivery is verified by QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether it's about the size or the contents of the package?
You can carry anything.
We have three sizes, small as a piece of butter, medium as a payload of eggs and large as a bass of beer.
Then there's no further restrictions, and if someone's in the car, maybe they'll take the ice cream.
Plus the transmitter has the option to take a picture in the package application, so the courier sees what he wants.
You don't even have to pack things if you don't want to hide the contents of the exhibit.
You're gonna put a forgotten mike in your hand and that's it.
Who came up with the idea, and how long did it take to get the job started?
My friend got the idea more than two years ago, so I didn't pay much attention to it.
Then he showed me a demo application with a cross-border reach aimed primarily at the passenger plane.
At the moment, I told him I wasn't looking for an investor, but I'd like to stand up to him and save him.
Next year, it took a long time for development than we established the LTD Shippancee LTD in London for the sake of greater credibility of the whole product.
But this isn't the version you're now focusing on.
No, marketing we focused on the Czech Republic, where we are trying to catch up to the app, because it had all the birth pains and still is something to solve and improve.
We are trying to react to the feedback from customers, and we are currently not solving that much of the foreign market.
We know it's a long race, but we don't take it, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippancee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were in their way of upgrading.
The transfer arose when we said that the national segment could be far more interesting and that we were at least learning about it in the Czech Republic.
The third application of the Messiah is local, for the city.
But he can send a package to the exact address and to the other end of the world.
It works for the senders as well as the Transfer, but the difference is that as a courier you see shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator in the mobile.
Apps for couriers who want to live with them, we called Mesík Profi.
So someone can make a show by picking up a package around the city?
Exactly, the last application will be downloaded to Prague by a taxi driver, student, mother to parents' leave, someone who wants to make the trip to work.
Now that everybody's stupid with those pimps, they can collect this all the same.
You see where the orders are, you get to it, you click and you see when it has to be delivered, and you carry the shipment.
It's set cheaper than competitive services.
At this point, we are doing more web interfaces that will be difficult for companies to send shipments, they will fill in on the web, so they will create points on the map.
Then we're able to use their service every month.
Now you're applying to the project for a full commitment?
It makes it difficult for us, but we normally have it when we work so that we can use the project and develop it.
We're not hiding behind a strong supranational investor, we're two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and the other got into it with other incentives and ideas.
Now we are looking for an investor strong enough to be able to compete with us, not the Czech market, but who should go with us to the world product and become another huge player on the market like AirBnB and Uber.
The history of Titanfall 2 is intended to bring a slightly forgotten density.
This will fix the second part and the solo game in it will be according to the first information more caver than in Call of Duty.
The length will move around the standard eight hours and the filling should come from just the concept of network charging in the first part.
Therefore, it is possible to enjoy the freedom of movement, which includes, in addition to running, the possibility of using combat titanium.
In addition to the action passports, the game will contain a level focused on the reverse movement.
They'll remember the plates and include the ribs.
For this reason, for example, there are two jumps, running through the walls and a chain lock.
Sometimes, in addition, the enemies will have to be eliminated.
There will be no missing maps of the crime scene and level with special concepts.
For example, it will be possible to lift and dry up the flats and close the door.
You'll be able to manage the image of the battlefield.
The pace of the games should be swayed between the urgent action and the calmer moments for exploring an unknown planet.
We're gonna play for Jack Cooper's pedestrian dreaming about a pilot's career.
Cooper at the start of the campaign together with Captain Lastimos spent on the alien planet Typhon, which is inhabited by enemy soldiers.
And there's not even a wild beast hanging over him.
In addition, Lastimosa will have fatal injuries during the crash, and Cooper will therefore be assigned to carry out the captain of the Titan.
His dream of a pilot's career comes true as soon as he expected.
The first step, however, will be to steal the battery needed to repair the robot.
They'll also be important for Cooper's calls with the Titan.
The players will serve as a source of information about the military's past, while the robot's personal communication will create moody moments.
For example, if titanium is to replace dry matter with all the injuries that Cooper threatens at the planned jump.
The first information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 brought the Polygon server.
In addition, the result will be judged in two months and Bonusweb will bring you the first impressions of the network game after Gamecom.
Titanfall 2 starts on October 28th, which is for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ mark will come back, but the original edition remains dead.
Swedish Nordic company changes its name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of THQ publishing, in 2013, the company acquired a number of its trademarks and the right to use the logo and company name.
Nordic, for example, released Darksiders 2 Deathnative Edition or Red Faction Collection.
In addition, there are 23 more games for publishing and 13 of them have not yet been discovered by the company.
Thirty years ago, at the time I retired, my wife, after 30 years of marriage, found a 20-year-old younger man, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - first it obviously tried for a longer time, then they got together.
He's such a big guy, probably her type, because she used to walk in front of me.
She's completely crazy about him.
In those first days, even her voice changed, she had such a girl, a beloved voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she wouldn't.
But I've noticed the whole thing.
He was working regularly at half a quarter, so she always left at three to buy.
Every day she tried to see him at least.
Later, I found out they were meeting at his bar in the laundry room.
How many times I knew they were right there.
I got my keys, he was determined to get them there.
But I don't know why, after all, I've always stayed home.
I've never been able to go there, take that decisive step.
Maybe you'll laugh at me, but I believe my wife thought I was in control.
Soon I found out that I'm in control of doing what she wants.
And I really did.
Maybe I'm just such a bartender.
At the same time, my neighbors then pointed out that he knew about it.
I was such a fool that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid that if it all broke, it would be bad.
That it's going to happen to everyone in the family, she only knew something about her daughter.
So I always put it down, keep it up and down.
But one day I went to his apartment to get help with something in the laundry.
He went there with me and I told him that I got anonymous, that he was dating my wife, and that he's a witness to it all.
I asked him what he was going to tell me.
He stood there, yelled at his shoulders, looked into the ground and didn't say a word.
Then I also met his wife on the road from the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn't respond, and she didn't tell me anything either.
Nobody told me anything back then.
I'm the kind of person who's never gone too far, who's got a problem meeting someone, so find a woman.
So I didn't even think about divorce.
I've always relied on it to end one day.
I said I'd forgive her everything and life would go on.
That's not how it was.
And I've never really dealt with it.
I've got it in me today.
I used to let her know a lot about it, but I finally left it alone.
He's still living in the next house and I'm still living with her.
It's just more than my wife's housewife.
She always did everything at home - cooking, washing, cleaning.
She's working.
She was always trying to keep me from having any other reason to complain.
And it can be said that it's even worth it.
But sometimes I'd like to look at her, hug her, and she won't let go.
We go for walks and shopping together, and everybody thinks we have a happy marriage.
But she once told me she never loved me.
She liked me, but she didn't love me.
And I see that she loves him so far, she's her god.
And I don't like that kind of life.
By the time it started, and I carried it very badly, I told her once that she didn't want me to live, and I wondered what she would have said if I had finished it.
I wanted to know if she'd agree with it or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: Yes or no.
But she thought and finally said, "But there's plenty of room here."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to create a new French Islamic foundation that should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
After the terrorist attacks, France is stepping up its fight against radical Islamists and calling for help from the government and the local Muslim minority.
"If Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee their freedom of recognition," Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
The intention is to ensure that only spiritual education in France is preached in the country.
He also wants to stop financing mixed from abroad, when the teachers often come with money to spy on jihad.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to create a new French Islamic foundation which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
The new institution replaces the current French Islamic Foundation established in 2005 by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
It was already expected to contribute to the review of the financial flows between the mixes and the countries financing their construction.
Soon, however, she was affected by internal strife, and that never worked properly.
"It's a total failure," Valls noted.
In front of the new foundation, it is likely that the former Minister of Interior and Jean-Pierre Chevénment's defense, who is known as the representative of the secular state, will become the head of the new foundation.
In France, there are some 2,500 mixes and prayers, about 120 of them serving radical Islam.
Since 2012, about 80 Islamic clergy have been hosted by the French authorities from the country, and several decades later this step has been considered.
This week the German police also attacked the jihadist spiritual police.
They allegedly recruited fighters for the Islamic state.
One of them occupied an area where believers allegedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Immediately after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate on a new institution was started in France, which will replace the non-functional foundation.
All have succeeded in further terrorist attacks carried out on behalf of the Islamic state by radical Islamists.
The new foundation will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of blends from domestic sources and also to monitor assets.
But it's not clear where he gets his money, even though he's considering a few proposals.
One of them is a special fee for food halls, especially meat from defeats according to Islamic principles.
In practice, this tax would be paid by the sellers of food halls, which would be granted permission.
Some of the money would then travel to the budget of the Foundation.
A contribution of between 10 and 20 euros could also be paid by French passengers who go to Mecca.
Every year they leave France for a traditional journey to Saudi Arabia, about 30,000.
Moreover, in French blends, only ministers who have gone through education programmes at the universities should be involved.
As a result, their preaching should be in line with democracy.
The government also shuts down radical mixtures.
"We have closed them twenty since December, and the next will follow," said Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve.
"There is no place in France for those who report hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was seriously injured by an unknown shooter on Friday morning at the shopping center in northern Spain Zaragoza, says the Independent newspaper.
There was a shooting after the woman and her daughter left the garages in their car.
The man was waiting in the car in front of the shopping mall, where he also started shooting.
According to the witnesses, a man then turned his weapon against himself, says the Independent.
The woman was taken to the hospital by an unharmed daughter, who had to accept a ambulance for men in critical condition.
The act took place around 11.00 in the central part of the Autonomous Metropolitan Region of Aragonia, near local universities.
With reference to the Spanish agency Europa Press, the Independent writes that the motive was probably unresolved recent divorce of both partners.
It's a Christmas party, we're looking at the races, the bells and the chilli sauce.
This summer he wants a light, well-eatable meal, but we Czechs are rebellious and have our tastes and our heads.
And so from summer gardens smells like grilled rabbits, dolls, pork poultice.
Not too healthy, not too easy, sometimes with the exception of salad or roasted vegetables.
True, grilling is time-saving, and it's also a social matter, and nobody has to be locked up in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to how to make good spices that special cooking, their preparation is a small ritual, but there is nothing longer to cook, bake, fry or breathe.
And they're still contributing to our health.
Whether it's a home sushi or sashimi, where quality raw materials and a few well-achieved graffiti are enough to make the preparation fun and eat the very real exotic ice cream.
Like even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
There's even a time-consuming cooking and freezing of rice.
The paper can only be put into the water for a moment and then it depends only on the fantasy of the cook, how he intends to play with the fillings and supplements.
There's no race like race.
The advantage of a number of Asian cuisine is that raw materials are usually available today.
Including a pre-filled sugarcane, which is one of the basic flavors of accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can prepare it at home, but the right pink garter has a unique spicy sharpness and at the same time a pleasant taste thanks to a secret recipe, according to which it blends from several kinds of octopus and octopus.
Therefore, it is sufficient to buy a bag of suitable size, and the Annex with demonstrable antibacterial effects, which supports digestion and resistance to cough or flu, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are especially used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in serving and decorating food in the context of various celebrations and rituals.
Long ribbed banana leaves are very widespread in a number of countries in Asia or South America as "help" for the preparation of the most varied roasted, cooked and roasted foods that are packed in them like in aloba.
The banana leaf then imparts a specific taste to the food.
We are able to buy in shops with exotic fruit and vegetables, even previously cut into the shape of wheels.
But take for yourselves sheets of green silk, and then of untwisted and untwisted.
Similarly, it is easy to prepare salads from a variety of waxes, sesame and sesame oil.
That one can buy frozen again.
Who often prepares or prepares sushi, I think he'll know a lot of lunatics.
In Japan, this is one of the most important species of marine species, from which the so-called nutrient list is produced by pollination, leaching and drying - i.e. wages for sushi production.
Wakame - a dark green breed growing in the waters around the island of Hokkaido - is also fresh and dried and is as popular as the nori breed.
By the way, whoever doesn't know the mass of a vama soup, apparently Asian women use it as a cure after birth.
And at all, this variety of effects is almost miraculous.
Clean blood, enhances blood circulation, even supposedly bans hair graying and is literally filled with mineral substances.
Dried and dissolved waxes also serve as roots, for example, to taste rice.
Fresh breeds are first let loose in the water, then melt, put into the female water and cook half a minute.
Then it cools in the ice water, cuts the middle ribs and further adjusts, perhaps like a favorite salad.
However, buying it is already the easiest solution, ready, frozen.
So it's just left to wrap a roll with easy vegetable filling, easy and easy, full of healthy flavors.
It's such a long-lasting bomb.
If you resist and don't add a grilled doll.
Eat healthy, light and summer.
The Asians know how to do this.
There are a few special raw materials and a little bit of silk, and you have interesting fresh food that easily combines taste.
And it's done once or twice.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g carrots, 40 g of white rare, 100 g of green crust, 60 g of salad cakes, 60 g of raisins and 60 g of sweet chili sauce.
Squeaked coriander, black sesame spoon, chili cheese sauce spoon, 20 g manga and 40 g of garniette, some pine nuts.
Let's get some windshields ready first.
We'll wet the rice paper for five seconds into cold water.
Then we'll take her out and wait until she gets down.
In the meantime, in hot water, we will soon cook the christian exits, and in about three minutes we will allow them to cool quickly into the ice water so that they do not lose their color.
We'll put a fill of vegetables on the approved paper and pack it.
Let's make it full of white rares, carrots and salad cakes, which we put on soft noodles, mix them with sweet chilli sauce, add saturated coriander, mix thoroughly and put on rice paper.
On the banana leaf, we put Christian exits, add turns, and finish all the food, we will get a variety of vacams, cooked with a bell, a manganese plate, a black sesame and add a few pine nuts.
Britain must be satisfied with silver in a seven-week rug, Fiji's choice takes gold
The remarkable performance of Britain in the week's rugby ended with a destructive footprint on the last obstacle, Fiji defeated in the final match on Thursday night at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio high 43:7.
The Fijians gave a master's lesson in processing, compilation, motion, support, running to the lain and brutal forces - and won gold, their first Olympic medal at all.
The defeat came with the unobstructed price of the silver medal - for Britain's third day - and the British could be proud of their performance at the opening of the seven-week football tournament, defeated New Zealand, Argentina, and the South Africa Republic.
Triumphed victory over South Africans 7:5 in the semifinal the same day, may have died in the final.
However, Fiji would have won in its form a 15-member team in full health.
I mean, it's not gonna be comforting for the British, but they can be happy that at least one of them will have gold medals around his neck tomorrow: the main fan of the Fijians is Ben Ryan, former Chief of England from Wimbledon.
Great Britain has hit a piece of the road.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, they lost every game in Adelaide Sevens.
They lost the only one here.
This defeat hurts, but progress is unstoppable.
Fiji began a great deal, the British ancestors reflected for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and the other partners it was like running a series of buses in the movement and the champions of the world cup led by 5:0 when Ocean Kolinisau emerged behind the corner.
The clock showed four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing, from which she was converted.
12:0 and Britain is having a hard time touching the balls.
Great Mitchell tried to stop huge Leon Nakaraw and prevent him from scored third, but only Fijians slowed down.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua hitdown to the right corner and the British lost 17:0.
Nakarawa added another one after the return and there was still more than 1 minute... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravou then penetrated the tiny British and came to the shit he scored.
After conversion to state 29:0, the break followed.
It was like Fiji was born for the rugby 7s, while the British were still learning the transmission.
That's exactly the way it is.
In time, the British made massive changes, and the effort of the Fijians stopped... for the entire four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until the brilliant interface of Fiji Joshua Tuis was further penetrated.
Dan Norton tried to get an opportunity for Britain, threw a touchdown into the left corner on an increase of 36:7. But the game had long won the inhabitants of the Pacific islands and their fans on the rocks sang, had flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire the completely excited approach of the Fijians.
In the final moments, Mata William cooled down another attempt to win the Fijians.
A whistler called, the Fijians hugged and the British fell on the lawn completely satisfied.
Earlier that same day Fiji defeated Japan 20:5 in the semifinal, and Great Britain defeated the Republic of South Africa in the narrow semifinal - unlike one conversion.
Kyle Brown got the South Africans in the first half of the day, but Dan Norton crossed the defensive line and scored in the second half of the day under the hook.
Marcus Watson, brother Anthony of the 15th team in England, made sure of the victory - and finally the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired the fight coach with cancer to win the race
You won't find more emotional gold in these games - and that's what to say.
From the first photo to the last, during 220 phasing-outs in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another significance in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
Although the two were happy, there were three voices in the ship. When the ship was hovering down the level to hit the second Olympic gold behind it in the women's race, there was still a voice in the ship of coach Robin Williams. They are the first women in the history of British sports that have achieved such a result.
Their advantage was absolute, overall it was their 39th race, in which they remained unsurpassed.
What we see - two excellent athletes, as they fly down the water level with the elegance of labor - does not reflect the character of victory completely.
For every gold medal in the rowing, there is a battalion of helpful hands, which means a piece by piece of difference. And no hands were more helpful than the hands of a coach who did not know if he would survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it was not true.
I suffered from the cancer of the bladder that can be operated, and I underwent this surgery.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
Somehow it will change your view of the matter.
Cancer was detected in Williams in December 2013.
Fortunately, for the whole trio, it was possible to start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, and thus reduce the accident to a minimum - if that is what we can call it under such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get fast together.
It was a wake-up call.
I was in the hospital and I went to the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at the time they said a few steps was enough.
That's how it started.
The wedding itself is the way, but it was more of a matter.
Immediately after his victory, their first thoughts on Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, were less than usual, as he tried to cope with his own unrest.
Stanning, the captain of the Royal Archdiocese, who has a mission to Afghanistan, said: “This week I was with emotions at the bottom, maybe it's a little extreme, but it means so much.”
Once again, it highlights how much it means to me, how much Helen and Robin and I worked together.
So far, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anybody, so thanks to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't wish for a better person for training or a better bitch.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning didn't lose the only race in five years.
The two sat at a tremendous rhythm, which their rivals could not balance.
Even in the final 500 metres, when crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning with Glover had a very large reserve.
We've focused at most the moment.
Helen shouted, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to give up.
We had a good start, and at the same time, we didn't complain about achieving something famous.
We didn't enjoy today's fireworks, we just wanted to get along well, go out and win the race, which we did.
He'll take two years to think before they decide what's next.
Glover's getting married next week. She's a TV associate of Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to taste that moment.
I didn't mean to say it was gonna be my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to find out I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes.
I feel a lot better about it," she said.

Prison?
Rather to drive people for free, says a cabmafie Rubes' hunter to a broken suit.
Six taxi drivers and former magistrate's officer in Prague are, as the ČT said, accused.
You have recorded a series of reports in which you have discovered fraudulent practices and those that are to be in the group that will be before the court.
You've been through a couple of unpleasant hits with exposed actors.
How much is the report of the members of an organized group too much for you?
I was waiting for some sort of court to come.
I'm mostly interested in judgment.
But I don't think they should be in prison.
That's for nothing.
They should pay back all the stolen money.
And they should get them back so they can drive all people free.
That's kind of a puzzling solution.
Does this mean that you do not consider the punishment to be effective enough?
It's enough for me that some of them are so scared that they don't work anymore.
For example, one makes a ping, another weighs the pizza, and one has completely lost out on it.
The prosecutions can theoretically get two to eight years in prison.
Do you think it's an adequate rate?
Generally, I have a problem with deprivation of liberty.
I think it's a bad punishment.
To put someone in prison, especially in such a case, is nonsense.
Such people should return to the companies that took her.
For the fourth century, it was a pity that our country had been destroyed and stolen.
So let's do a good card now and weigh people for free.
I can't imagine.
It would act as a public service.
As someone goes to collect waste, they'd get a car and drive people around Prague free of charge.
No, I really think they'll finally get the condition and they'll care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Miroslav Ondříčka Film Academy in Piska and then at Tomáše Bati University in Zlina.
It belongs to people who started with viral videos and videos directly for the web in the Czech Republic.
She works as an editor for Stream.cz, where she is participating in a series of shows, and is now preparing the Prague Guide series, which is intended primarily for foreign viewers.
By means of these brief reports, Rubes advises which services in Prague should be avoided and which, on the contrary, he recommends, should be used without fear.
Previously filmed a series called How to It, City of Treasons?, Life in Luxury, And Enough! and Prague vs. Money.
They are referred to as an organised group in the proceedings.
The police have been watching her for months.
Can such a network of underwater taxi drivers be identified as a mafia?
They're such cute mafians, not the ones we know from Kmotra.
It's more of a mafia than a junior, but it's definitely organized.
It's just that they're watching each other's staffs.
The powder is all scattered.
I found that for example, the main station doesn't like Paris, Paris doesn't like taxi drivers waiting at Karl's Lázní (disco club)
Everyone just keeps an eye on their own place and every group is somehow organized.
It's probably a network.
But only seven people, six taxi drivers, and one former magistrate who warned the driver from the controls were charged.
As you're saying, the side effects didn't disappear from the street.
So what is the percentage of Prague smugglers in the taxi service according to your estimate?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst ones on the street are still.
For example, I'm talking about Alesh Ryjacz.
It's a man who's really dangerous - he rides a telescopic shoe in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he stands at Karl's bridge and drives people.
Last time I went with him, he wanted me seven hundred miles away.
His police didn't stop for any reason.
Only a few people from the whole big group were chosen.
The same situation is, however, also in other places of Prague.
Thus, seven people’s complaint is difficult to clear out the already reported Prague mess, which is likely to have much bigger dimensions.
Of course it's nothing.
It will help, but all evil will not be eliminated, that's the truth.
Are taxi drivers who steal foreign tourists still performing in the same places as you showed in the reports, i.e. at Karl's Bridge or on the Paris Street?
Yes, that's right.
These locations are located every day, and every day they violate the announcements.
He ignores both the city police and the Prague magistrate.
It's not even a cocours anymore, it's a total nostalgic.
Business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
However, some of them, even if it's only part of the group, will be brought before the court.
It's already a breach.
So I have to ask myself, do you feel enough?
If I took it as an excuse, it would be wrong because it was my goal, and it will always be to improve the Prague centre.
And even though I'm gonna feel a little better about it, I'm gonna keep on doing it.
You need to press the door on the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we should still do something to remove him.
You can't settle for that.
But it's not like that, of course it's more.
Are you still trying to confront them directly in taxis?
Sometimes I do a test ride and I have to say it's still bad.
Just last week, I caught a cabman, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He paid 560 kroner for three kilometers, although he then claimed that it was 56 kroner (he used a ten-kroner trick).
He had the claim, the cops came in, and this taxi driver was so cute, he was still following those cops and asked them when someone finally gave him the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
A taxi driver on the tax meter caught a dozen bucks and stole tourists with 357 crowns.
Is it to be said that the rigour of the underwater taxikers didn't come up even after you showed the faces of those who were counting the foolish amounts for a short ride?
Their strength is still incredible.
How'd it go with the cab driver demanding 56 crowns?
The police sent him away with the fact that they couldn't discuss the matter with him on the spot because he posted a bill.
And that will be, I think, a problem with the court (six taxi drivers and one external officer).
On the one hand, there will be a taxi driver with his bills, on the other hand, the police.
However, according to the Supreme Administrative Court decision, the magistrate may not use secret records from a taxi service vehicle as evidence at the court.
When I filmed the works of their deceptions, the taxi drivers themselves warned me about this precedent.
I've always wanted to use the pictures in the report.
Are you worried that this reality could protect them from court?
I hope every judge will understand that no taxi driver could ride six or ten kroner miles because he wouldn't live with it.
You've been talking about a trick with a ten-year-old who, especially in front of foreign customers, is being pushed by underwater taxi drivers.
Is it still up-to-date, or are they worried about using this fig tree after publishing your reports?
I think we've been popular with this trick by sending the show.
I recently went with a taxi driver, boasted in front of me that he was the honest taxi driver.
Then I noticed that on the side of the taximeter, I had a black stick attached.
When I asked him what it was like, he said to me, "You know what it is."
If the taxi drivers didn't work too well, could they be tried with their colleagues?
Is there anything that can get them out of cheating?
You've been talking about the way you think you're going to cheat, they'll always find it.
I don't think there's anything to do with them.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And they're fair taxi drivers who should do more to get them out of there.
From my experience, I have to say that the fair taxi drivers in Prague are fortunate enough.
But are they willing to go against those who undermine the reputation of their service?
They like it, but they miss it.
He can't go through with it and he can't say exactly what he wants.
When the demonstration was organized (due to a proposal for a complete restriction from the office of the primary minister of Adriana Krnáč) it was not very clear what they really wanted.
They once said they didn't protest against Uber, that they just wanted to have the same conditions as this service, and then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It turned out that they were just blocking Prague and that it was only the best possible advertising for Uber.
How do you assess the overall approach of the Prague magistrate to solving the problem of driver prevention?
It's obvious that she had to get into this when the criminal police tried to solve something.
The magistrate was short on it.
They had a mole there who was inventing information, which means that the cab department has been doing its job for a few years completely out of hand.
I hope that the officer will be charged with the final inspection of all the checks he's been trained to make himself aware of what he's done.
That's the worst thing I've ever seen.
I was even with him on a check-in trip, which I found out after their appointment.
It's been months since the last part of the series was published.
What's the response?
I'm thinking mostly about foreign audiences, than it's actually the most focused series.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I'll let them go.
And then when we go to the Old Town Square, there's a surprise that the same people who are seen in the pictures are really standing.
Infamous Prague celebrities.
Oh, really.
I'd put a plate around them so people would look at them.
Museum of Communism directly on the street.
My last question is clear.
You're driving a taxi when you need it?
Right.
I'm driving services that I don't have to pay for in cash, but with a card.
I'm using services like Uber or Elevator where there's no possibility of cheating.
But there's a lot of gossip that's fair.
I've only taken a taxi on the street since then.
The driver told me after he got into the car, "Well, you've got the courage."
I'm in a changeover for an Italian tourist.
It was written about the fraudulent practices of taxi drivers in 2005.
In the same year, the former Prime Minister Paul Bem went on a check-in ride to get dressed for an Italian tourist, and immediately on his first attempt, his driver ambushed him by two hundred.
But editor Rubes had worse experience.
The drivers of the taxi service charged him for the trip from Old Town to Václav Square 820 koruna, which is about 195 koruna per kilometer, as reported by the reporters.
The Prague Magistrate then set a maximum price of 28 kroner per kilometer.
The report also includes other surprising sums: for example, a two-kilometre journey from the street Pariská to Truhlářské stastá tourist 400 korun.
Dear rides also provided taxi drivers waiting for Karl's bridge.
For a ride to the Angel, which is two and a half miles [2.5 km] away, they'll have to take six hundred crowns.
Marble washes itself mostly with clean water, the most without chemistry and as long as possible, the better.
The impurities from him go well, although sometimes the dirt has to be put down with the scalpel, it has to be removed from action.
It's not easy and it's not fast, it's getting closer to her work by Vanessa Trostová of Oldrich in The Hague.
Cover down in front of it: the tomb is built with a bed, after which you have to go out and go again.
"The restorer should be careful, patient and unrelenting in the working environment," she noted.
In Frydlansk, it's not far from her first restoration work.
Thanks to it, for example, the stone elements of the facade in the back tract of the Frydlant Council, it also restored the statues of St. Mary Magdalena in Zatiš, St. John Nepomuck's in Frydlant, Piet in Frydlant County Street, Marian's column in Frydlant, or atlanta in front of the spa in New City under Smrk.
With the restoration of Melchior, Krystofa and Katerina from Rederna, Frydlant started in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleansed from the burden of uncleanness and the cross, the loose stone parts shall be secured against falling and moving; they shall either be thrown into the wall or to each other.
They are also waiting for treatment and maintenance of the surface.
The inscriptions on the tomb will be gold again.
"Then it begins with the yellowing of marble plates with red plated gold," said the State Memorial Care Representative of the City Office in Friedlant Vera Sobotová.
There's no record from the past that the tomb would have gone through some repairs.
At a closer look, the openings wrapped in marble columns will be opened.
They're hundreds of years old, and it's about the remains after the funeral.
He was richly decorated. Unfortunately, after the Swedish raid on the Thirty Years of War, everything disappeared.
They literally read the tomb, they noticed Saturday.
In the Church of the founding of the Holy Cross there are restaurants with a slight oversathement as home.
After the flood in 2010, it was necessary to put in order the tomb that was buried under water, restored the baptismal halls, wall paintings in the tomb and now the tomb.
"We'd also like to be part of the war in the future," said Saturday.
The church is otherwise in a very good condition, we invest money every year in maintenance and repair.
Restoration work on the refurbishment of the Redernov tomb will total 128 thousand crowns.
They'll be played with grants, the city in this part will not re-insert any of its money.
A hundred thousand crowns will come from the victory in the regional round of the 2015 Historical City of 2015, the remaining 28 thousand crowns are then the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, said Mayor Frýdlanta Dan Ramzer.
A representative decided to release the victory for the restoration of the tomb.
Expert views on future developments in selected foreign markets monitored through indices and comparisons with the Czech capital market (PX) in the one-month and half-year horizon.
Low volatility and growth prevail in the markets.
Who would have said that at the beginning of the year?
The U.S. S&P500 index, which went through 12% of the adjustments in February, is today at a new historical peak and has already attributed 7% since the beginning of the year.
Once again, the iron rule is confirmed that traders should never go against the interests of central banks, which have so far always achieved their own.
In a situation where American shares at the historical maximum are again losing volatility, which is currently the lowest since 2014, when markets grew satisfactorily and without fear due to the quantitative release of the US Central Bank and when as today's Volatility Index (VIX) remained stable below the 12% threshold.
And don't.
Although the Fed market is still preparing for the gradual increase in interest rates, the quantitative release in Europe and Japan is in full flow and last week has also joined the Bank of England, which will purchase 70 billion pounds in the coming six months.
Thus, the new wave of quantitative release is already pushing down so low results and contributing to almost complete elimination of risks and fear from the future.
How long will this state last?
That's, of course, a million-dollar question.
But at the moment there is no risk, the world economy is going through almost constant growth without higher performances, the situation on the commodity market and in China is stabilised and Brexit is basically no longer the subject, so we should probably not be too surprised if, in a similar peaceful regime, the American stock continued.
Too bad Juncker doesn't study Klaus!
I'm very glad my friend Michel Barnier took this important and demanding task.
I wanted to do this difficult work of the experienced policy, the head of the European Commission Juncker said, when the French policy (really experienced, because of the diversity of supranational political functions that we are looking for a better example of the so-called European elite) appointed the main negotiator of the European Commission for the conditions of departure of Great Britain from the EU.
Juncker's election failed the signs hope that it is in the EU's serious interest to seek with Britain the form of future friendly coexistence.
However, most British media adopted the name Barnier as Juncker's war act.
Barnier is a rock European federalist.
Great Britain hates it.
As the European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014), he was concerned about the reform of European banking law.
He captured her as he could only understand her: a closed enemy of the English concept of free market and the model of capitalism.
The representative of multilateral regulations was a co-author of the so-called banking union concept and supported everything that came from the London City Financial Centre and passed legislation over the hard financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in the dispute with London, is going to be a tough, unscrupulous, and probably even impartial negotiator.
I don't think that's good news.
How can you not recall in this context the peaceful and friendly division of the Czechoslovak Federation, which has contributed so much to the balance, overview and ability of Prime Minister Václav Klaus.
And that's why today Czechs can be the closest friends and allies to Slovaks.
It's a shame Juncker didn't learn from Václav Klaus - at least in this.
It would be for everyone!
Earthquake around Putin?
Lord Kremlu has missed his close Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin passed Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the President's office on Friday.
Let's take his place, Anton Vajno.
She informed the Russian media about this by calling the Kremlu press release.
Putin, however, indicated that Ivan's leaving at his own request.
At a meeting broadcast by the Russian television station 24, the president said he was going to come to meet Ivan's wish when he came into office to be head of the president's office for a maximum of four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for the environment and transport.
The report on the exchange with the president of the administration, now led by Ivanov's former representative Ivanov, is considered rather surprising.
Ivanov, 63 years of age, is one of Putin's closest associates.
This former KGB officer in the past, for example, stopped the role of Minister of Defence and Vice-President of the Government.
Now the chair of the President's Security Council.
Ivanov at the meeting with Putin, however, stated that a long delay in the administration of the head of state is actually a recordman.
He's been in it for four years and eight months.
In this regard, he recalled that 11 people had already been appointed for this function in 25 years since its establishment.
Bite or blizzard Uncle Shafář won't play the finals.
So far, none of the Friday tennis matches have been able to change in final participation.
As his first battle, Peter Quette lost, who suffered the Puerto Rican surprise of Monica Puig after the 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6 centuries.
The receipt was followed by the Czech lightningmen Shafáriva with the Uncle.
The owners of Williams' sisters in the first set scored after the win, however, they wasted two sets and Russia finally took advantage of the set in the short game.
The second hundred then lost the ratio of 4:6.
The semi-successful in the morning program in Rio recorded the Czech rowing: skier Ondřey Son won his semi-finals with a review when the second Damira Martin from Croatia won even after his release in almost a second.
Today's good, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I've been trying to save as much as possible, said the Son.
His opponents, unlike him, had to fight about the procedure.
So it's got some power on them, so it could be easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's gonna be easy. It's just playing cards.
Mirka Topinkova-Knapkova but she didn't walk in Snyk's blinds.
A 50-year-old bulldozer sat in her fourth position at the semifinal today and on Saturday she is waiting for the start at the B final and the fight from 7th to 12th.
The gold from London doesn't defend it that way.
For the first time, I didn't go to the finals at the Olympics.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I went to a quality race, and I put everything in it.
The rivals were just better, the Topinkova button moved in front of them.
She fought to the end and believed that she'd get to the elite six in her fourth game.
The fight has given up just before the target.
I knew the girls were balanced, that anyone could come down from the field.
I was surprised by the Chinese that she had such a finish.
And I thought I could get through the Rakushank to the final.
Unfortunately, today was a life race, she told the 2011 World Championship.
Far beyond the final gates of Rio, young shooter Filip Nepeichal, who had not been able to get out of his qualifications for the second time, this time in bed.
In it, Nepeichal occupied the 33rd place.
Qualifications were the best for the Russians.
From the first step, Sergei Kamenskii descended with 629 points, from the second Kirill Grigorjan (628.9).
Neatechal's shot had a value of 620.5 points.
In Rio, for the first time, athletes also spoke, including Czech seven-year-old Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová.
The coaches belong to the 11th place after the second discipline of the Olympic competition, the Czech recordman Eliška Klučinová is twenty-one.
The British leader is Katarina Johnson-Thampson, who jumped to an altitude of 198 centimeters as well as the second Belgian Nafissatou Thiam.
Both took care of the historically best performance within the seven-bone.
They tried to jump 201 centimeters yet, but they didn't.
German, Russian, who's worse?
When we look away from the absurdity of the questions raised, the German society has gone through a deep seberflex, which is not Russian.
In both major Eurasian nations, dictators appeared in the 20th century and came to power by regimes that were non-human, brutal and terrible.
From 1917 to 1989, the Russian Bolsheviks have contributed a great deal to the 94 million victims of Communism, which the Black Book of Communism states, whether it is daily individual repression, targeted famine, incompetent war management or non-human experiments.
In a non-Christian way, the Nazis have frozen about 6 million Jews, and the total victims of World War II are estimated at 60 million.
In occupied or abandoned territories, animals were carried out by the Germans and the Soviets.
In Germany or in the USSR, only a few individuals were guilty, but much of the nation participated in these crimes, whether actively, passively or merely by beating their heads in the sand.
It's not just the specificities of these nations, we Czechs are likewise guilty.
In Germany, the immediate end of the war came desecration, the Noriber Court.
But the most important thing came later.
When the children grew up, they began to ask: Father, Grandpa, why did you participate in such a beast?
How could you?
This brought real reflection and healing to society.
German elites have recently taken care mainly of the country's prosperity, the elimination of poverty, the welfare of their citizens.
Now they also have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but they certainly do not have to be connected back to Alaska-Lotrinska or to someone - to revenge - military attack - that's what everyone will admit.
There was no great reflection after the cold war in Russia.
The window of possible positive changes was definitely closed at the break of the millennium when the former KGB officer (sic!)Vladimír Putin came to power.
Often the criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
Putin's policy of Russia is revenge, acquisition of lost territories, humiliation of the West.
Health, prosperity, and the future of our own people are no value to the summit.
Fight yours, and strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that it is only through the decades of the despotic regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior - destined for an Asian (self) tyranny.
To whom does the growth of tension around Crimea lead?
Ukrainian army.
In recent days and hours, the situation has deteriorated at the Ukrainian-Russian border in the area of Crimea.
To whom does the growth of tension benefit?
After a longer period of relative peace, there has been another deterioration in relations between Ukraine and Russia.
The Ukrainian side's castle became part of the Crimea peninsula, which was connected to Russia more than 2 years ago and is part of its territory.
The reports from both sides are, of course, contradictory and difficult to verify independently, so we have only the possibility of thinking about the old well - known question to whom?
According to reports from Moscow, there have been terrorist attacks on Crimea on the Ukrainian side, which, of course, Ukraine rejects and, on the contrary, accuses Kreml of provocation.
For information on the arrest of members of the Ukrainian special units in the territory of Russia, the driver Savchenk's famous reply that they allegedly were kidnapped in the territory of Russia has already come from the case of a pilot.
If we were to join the Ukrainian version, what would Russia do to make the situation worse around Crimea?
The simple answer is nothing.
The escalation of tension around Crimea can only harm Russia, mainly from the West in the form of further sanctioning and strengthening the anti-Russia campaign.
In recent years, the immigration crisis in Europe has shifted attention from the situation in Ukraine.
Ukraine's leadership has already lost all credit before its inhabitants, when President Poroshenko's current support moves around 15%.
The economy of Ukraine would have long failed to be a generous financial injection by the EU and especially by the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to pay particular attention to its country again so as to justify its further requests for financial assistance and try to improve its reputation before the voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the management of the strength components are once again wanting to be seen as strong men who do not fear to stand up to the great Russia.
It is only hoped that all those who are trying to resolve the open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will finally realize their huge responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers, but all ordinary people on both sides of the enemy and stop their enemy action in time.
Bulgaria first showed inflation in eight months
According to national statistics, in Bulgaria, the monthly rate of inflation was 1 % in July.
This is the highest value in several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0,2 % was published.
The annual average inflation rate measured by the CPI index for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8 %.
The consumer price index in July 2016 versus June 2016 was 101,0 %, and monthly inflation was 1,0 %.
The rate of inflation since the beginning of the year (July 2016 versus December 2015) was -0.2 % and the annual rate of inflation in July 2016 against July 2015 was -0.2 %.
In contrast to the previous month, in July 2016, there was an increase in the roads of these consumer groups: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and usual maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
At the same level as the previous month, prices remained for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
The U.S. Secret Service was watching the Russian hacker attacks last year.
Information on Russian attacks was received to the public last month, when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was dealing with an attack on the servers of the side centre of the Democrats.
However, there is no official report on Russia's involvement in the attack.
Moscow's involvement in the attack was denied.
The report on the follow-up to the alleged Russian attack was strictly classified, as its disclosure would reveal that the U.S. secret services were monitoring and detecting a hacker attack could also be the way they did it and the resources they used.
Two Russian intelligence services participated in the attack.
New Advisory Body on Cybersecurity
The material on monitoring the Russian track was coded and access to it had only a small group of experts, wrote Reuters.
Only a small group of eight members of Congress, called the U.S. gang, were informed of public factors.
It is formed by both the Chief Chambers of Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the presidents of the two Chambers of Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and four members of the Defence and Security Committees of Congress.
The Head of the Democratic Party of Brazil announced on Thursday that he is setting up an advisory body for cyber security, which "is to prevent future attacks and ensure the first-class protection of the democratic party's servers".
In a certain salmon from Albert, there was a dangerous parasite.
The chain apologized.
On the basis of the consumer's motivation for health problems after consumption of the food Losos wilde - pieces 100 g, the date of consumption 22.11.2016, Fresco hygienics carried out control at the Albert stores in Václav Square and Na Móstka.
The verification found that charges L23012562/T4 with the date of consumption 22.11.2016, which the customer has indicated is no longer available, and therefore the product of the same charge was selected with the date of consumption 11.12.2016.
The presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex was confirmed by laboratory examination.
It's a parasitic worm of the seaweed weed.
It is dangerous to man - larvae in the body cavity or the muscle of fish are a strong allergen and a man of mature live larvae can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs, says Štich.
Customers are very sorry for the problems with this brand product.
We immediately removed the charges mentioned above from the sale and for preventive reasons we also removed all other charges of this item.
There was a doubt on the supplier's side that we were dealing with, and at the same time we let this product test ourselves, said News spokesman Albert Barbor Vanko.
If a customer buys this product, he can return it in any of the stores chain and get the money back.
The larvae destroys the cold and sufficient heat adjustment
Nekton was a salesman.
The presence of a dangerous product by the hygienics has been reported to the Prussian and Central Czech veterinary authorities.
According to the food safety server, people after exposure to parasites may be infected with anisaciosis, which results in acute abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or disease can occur undetectable, says the ČTK.
Symptoms will be delivered within an hour or two weeks after consumption of insufficiently warmed fish.
After three weeks from the start of the larval disease, the majority will spontaneously leave the tract.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to high and low temperatures, so they are killed either by sufficient heat processing of fish meat or by freezing it.
The veterinarians have now checked the salmon also with the consignee of the imported goods in the Mediterranean region.
Three of the five samples tested had parasites in them.
The consignment arrived in the Czech Republic in 1700 according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) at the beginning of April.
Dispatched, in the vast majority of the Aalh chain, has been packed to date 919 packages.
Currently, unsold goods are being downloaded from the sales outlets, SVS spokesperson Petr Peichal said on Friday.
As soon as positive samples were found, the veterinarians prohibited the dispatch of other products from the consignment.
Seventeen-year-old British wanted to run from Rakka, probably killed her by a Russian raid.
After the initial excitement and a quick engagement with the jihadist who was killed by the beatings, a stabbing came.
The expected paradise of the caliph became hell on earth for British girls, from which there was no escape.
The girl was related in contact with her sister Halimo.
She called Britain again and believed she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic state is like trying to escape Alcatraz.
They have an order to shoot without reason, quoted The Telegraph as the family's lawyer for the dead girls of Tasnim Akunjee.
The last tracks led to Rakka, from there the girl called last.
Then there's just a report of her death, but she can't be verified.
The family was communicating with her from an apartment in East London.
They discussed together how she could get out of Rakka and cross the Turkish border.
There they were hoping to meet their former student again.
But Cadiza was probably killed before she could escape because the house she was staying in was compared to the country in May, British ITV News reported.
The television added that the bomb was likely dropped by a Russian aircraft that attacked the IS garden in Syria.
You'd take the wise from the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, a family lawyer.
In the week that Kadiza thought about the escape from the territory of the Islamic State, one Rakušanka was caught while trying to escape and, according to the available information, she was publicly killed to death.
I think you've put it (Cadiza) out as a warning and decided to take care of it, according to BBC Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana and 15-year-old friends from Shamimo Begumov and Amira Abasov school were released on the way to February 17th last year.
The only thing they said at home was that they were going out.
But they went to Gatwick airport and from there through Turkey to the I.S.-controlled territory.
The girl's family according to the lawyer did everything in her power to get Cadiz back.
You'd take the wise from the sky just to get your child out of dangerous areas and this family did everything she could to get her daughter home.
But it wasn't possible without the risk of being caught by the lawyer himself.
The only positive thing he believes is that Kadiz's fate can serve as a deterrent case for other girls or even boys who are being harassed by Islamic propaganda.
"There are many cases when people went out there, realized how things were, understood how far it was from the promises of the Islamic state propaganda, and wanted to come back," Akunjee further noted.
The fate of Cadiz's associates is unknown.
But since they also calmed down, their families had to make peace with the fact that they were most likely dead.
In prison for money.
In Scotland, you can go to the grid without committing a crime.
For many centuries, the town of Inveraray was the regional center and seat of the Duke of Argyll.
From the middle of the 18th century, courts were held at the council Hall, and a basement under the shade served as a local prison.
The conditions under which they lived were sad and many prisoners tried to escape.
A lot of them, too, have been successful.
Therefore, the city representatives decided to move the prison premises to a new place.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more welcoming, warm and gas lighting to the prisoners.
It was not long in operation that it was closed for economic reasons by the end of August 1889, since smaller repair facilities were expensive and did not pay too much.
Stories of censorship and ghost hunt.
For the public, the prison opened over the centuries later, visitors can compare the old building to a new one to see how different conditions prevail in them.
The guide in contemporary costumes still reinforces the authentic experience.
There is also a torture room in which visitors can learn what forms of punishment were applied to criminals, whether it was fingering or burning marks on the body.
During the visit, tourists may be allowed to stay in one of the cells, mostly because of the photo on the memory, or to express the feeling behind the bars of the prison.
Besides, the Inveraray prison is one of the best-known Scottish sites he's supposed to be afraid of.
There have already been several groups of paranormal hunters and today the museum allows people to come and hunt some ghosts.
That night, however, goes to 300 pounds, which is estimated to be about 9500 crowns.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the village also boasts great food, surrounding landscapes and history.
"Anime" effect on Snapchat is criticised as Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by inanimate, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
The Snapchat app every day allows about 150 million users to change reality and play with the identity of ways that border with absurdity.
You can make yourself a pineapple, a dog, or a character that looks like Roye Lichtenstein.
Filters are simple tools that deform reality and generate more than 30 million improved silicones every day.
Any fault will be released immediately.
Snapchat filters in the past have been criticised by the accusation that the application promotes blackfacing or that it supports white shades of skin as an ideal for beauty.
So when this week offered a filter to users, which gave them wide eyes, curved teeth and swollen faces, some critics called it the Asian racist character - "yellowface."
And they were asked if these repeated controversial questions did not indicate a greater problem for society - a problem with diversity.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote and the news and frustration spread rapidly and Snapchat immediately indicated that the function had been canceled the next day.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was meant as an expression of the account of characters in vain, not as an Asian cartoon.
But to observers who witnessed racism, the filter noted painful stereotypes in action.
The others without a pack of comparisons with no one turned down.
Grace Spapani, a student of American art from Korea whose tweet about photos was widely shared, stated in an e-mail that the filter was "at least harmful and embarrassing."
She added that “it is difficult to argue against the comparison of the obvious Asian character and effects of the filter.
It is shown that the filter is not only about the yellowface, but that the yellow face is affected by the ugly extremities.
Snapchat is not the only company that has crossed these cultural boundaries.
American culture seems to have an endless fight about diversity and inclusiveness, from meetings in corporations around Hollywood and the facilities that we all carry in our hands.
And the huge number of young people in Snapchat - who are more racially diversified than their older partners - can mean that even more sensitivity can be expected.
“When a Snapchat filter creates an image that is offensive to some user,” said fifty-five Katie Zhu on Thursday in the interview, “it is very difficult for these things to go around today without notice, as it was before.”
Katie Zhuová, the product manager and designer who works for the Medium, decided on Thursday to delete her account at Snapchat and invited others to do the same.
In the media article and in the telephone conversation, she stated that she was convinced that racially motivated problems reflect the lack of diversity in the workforce in Snapchat.
Katie Zhuová criticized the dominant white, fully male management of the company and finished the article hash tag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's either that there's no diversity and color people between employees at the moment they decide on these things," said Zhu, who has Chinese-American origin, "or there's people working, but not in positions to feel safe or pleasant to talk about."
Other observers share her opinion - a complaint that Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its employees by having a private company status.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to talk about the racial origin of his employees, but according to the spokesperson, she recently accepted a recruit who should focus on the insufficiently represented population and on internal management of inclusion.
Zhuová adds: “I wonder if other users really need to say that it’s not okay,” with their account being cancelled.
The military officials have written a report on the IS, the parliamentary committee says
In a report issued on Thursday, the parliamentary committee stated that officials from the United States Central Command had changed the reports of the reporting services in order to provide a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the events from the country.
According to the preliminary report of the Working Group, drawn up by the President of the Republican Armed Forces Committee, the Committee on Rapporteurs' Services and the Subcommittee on Defence, a "extensive dissatisfaction" was found between the analysis of the Central Reporting Service, according to which their supervisors changed their assessment of the American effort to defeat the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as CentCom, is an army centre in Tampey, Florida, which oversees American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The press release states: “The results of the intelligence secret services approved by the senior officers of Centcom usually offered a more positive picture of US counter-terrorism efforts than those confirmed by the facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than the analyses obtained from other parts of the reporting community.”
"What happened in Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are damaged when a misanalysis has been presented to the political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Congressman and Republican of California.
The failure in running Centcom reaches the top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the continuing problems of the Central Staff in describing and analysing American efforts in training the Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although there is no decisive evidence that the senior representatives of Obama's administration have ordered the reports to be modified, the report states that the analysts had the impression that they were under pressure from the leaders of Centcom to present a more optimistic view of the danger presented by the Islamic State or IS.
"In the first half of 2015, many central staff press reports, statements and statements from Congress were much more positive than what the events actually were," the report states.
For example, the representative of Centcomu publicly stated that the main military attack on Mosul's takeover could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"This is quite clear after months of the investigation," said MP Mike Pompeo, representative of the Republican party from Kansas, in a statement.
From the mid-2014 to the mid-2015, the highest level of staff in Central US intelligence services have been manipulated with staff intelligence outputs in order to bagatize the threat of IS in Iraq.
The Republicans formed a working group after learning about the concerns of analysts that information on the reporting services concerning the Islamic State is being manipulated.
After the report published on Thursday, further examination must be followed up by a more detailed examination.
In Centcom's reporting services, further investigations are being carried out by the Ministry of Defence's Chief Inspector.
Democratic members of the Committee on Reporting Services published their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to some of the conclusions of the Working Group of the Republicans.
"between 2014 and 2015 Centcom has created a very narrow process for the compilation of the assessment of information on IS and Iraqi security components," said representative Adam B. Schiff, Chairman of the Committee and Representative of Democrats.
According to Adam Schiff, this process "has led to the transformation of the outputs of the reporting services", has damaged morale between analysts, and "has failed to take into account inconsistencies".
However, Schiff and the Democrats claim that they have found no evidence that the White House would try to press on Centcom's analysts to adjust their conclusions according to the "proposal or political situation".
Preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published in Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on the ongoing investigation of the Inspector General of the Pentagon, which was initiated following the complaints of the Centcom analysts.
Commander-in-chief Patrick Evans, speaker of the Pentagon, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the parliamentary report because the investigation of the Inspector General is still ongoing.
However, he stated that "experts sometimes do not agree to the interpretation of complex data and that the rapporteurs' community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these key issues of national security."
The investigation has an impact on the scope of the question whether the Americans are successful in bombing Iraq and Syria (a sentence now declaring an increasing number of defence representatives).
However, the last year's indictment raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can rely on the Central Staff to honestly evaluate the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of the report on the Islamic state has reflected conflicts for more than ten years, when an analyst at the Centcom Gregory Hooker's news services wrote a research work stating that the administration of President George W. Bush - despite the opposition of many analysts - defended a small unit in Iraq and spent only a little time thinking about what would follow the invasion in 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in resisting the Islamic state's reporting services.
Last year the authorities announced that the Hooker team had concluded that despite a public statement of opposition, air strikes against the Islamic state refineries had not significantly weakened the financial resources of this terrorist group, as the group had built temporary refineries and oil sales on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the findings were not transmitted outside the Central Staff.
Commander Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was then criticised last year after many legislators sought the Senate's testimony by too positive an assessment of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and replaced Gen Joseph L. Votel in Centcom.
USA won the fourth in a row in the ground hockey game, so today a decisive match will be played in the UK team
Katie Bamová in the match against Japan, who ended the match at 6:1, shot three goals, and only one day later, for the American women's team of the ground hockey, shot the first two goals of the match in which America defeated India 3:0.
Five branches in two matches are a good memory success, but Bam (27) said that she was not sure if she had ever succeeded.
"I have no idea," she said.
I don't belong to those who write down their branches.
But he knows this: The Americans at the Olympic tournament lead to the 4:0 match and are divided into the first place in the group with Great Britain, which remained on Thursday after the defeat of Japan 2:0 remained unbeatable.
Great Britain and the United States meet on Saturday in the last round game.
Both teams qualified for the quarter final and the game will decide which of the six teams will end in the first and second place.
The team in the first place will be able to avoid the strong Data that are in the lead of the second group for a while.
Whatever the end of the Saturday game, the Americans here caused their surprise ride, four years after they ended up with 12 teams playing in London.
There was Bam on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and a hockey game on the ground hockey took her first hand when she was 3 years old (her older twin sisters played in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player at all.
The 2008 Olympics avoided her because she didn't get on the final list.
Then came the year 2012, when neither she nor the members of her team were successful.
Next year, he was appointed a coach named Englishman Craig Parnham and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
In London, we didn't have the rate of work we have today.
We've made a complete turn.
On Thursday night Bam began in the first half of the shooting of a nearby branch.
India entered the game without winning in the tournament, but the team proved to be surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1.0 to the end of the third quarter when Bam took advantage of the opportunity.
She escaped on the left side of the playing field, then clicked into the middle and shot the ball into the branch to get the Americans to lead 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last branch in half the fourth quarter.
The elimination of the American bartender, Jackie Briggs, who in each of the three wins helped to one goal, was at least the first in the tournament.
He's in excellent shape.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good place now," said Parnham, but how good it is will depend on the result of the Saturday match.
Zen trampoline in the middle of the Olympic Belt
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter what time it is - it's an Olympic.
From the events in Rio de Janeiro it is felt persistent, indescribable and interested in the mediation of competition and efforts.
It's like the Olympic origin itself is a hot stove wheel that is passed from the shooter to the swimmer, the gymnast and the triathlonist.
You can't turn on the TV, read the papers, or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the front of the cafe without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the hostility between Michael Phelps and Chad le Close.
And then Logan Dooley too.
Dooley, the coming lover of women with hairstyles in their faces, is at the Olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose names will be heard in households during the main broadcast time between advertising and sponsoring spots, if he was a swimmer, a gymnast or even a Shermir.
But Dooley (28) from Lake Forest in California fights for Olympic gold in trampoline jumps.
The Olympic fire doesn't shine on all the competitions anyway.
Far from the center, there are some in the shadow sports that are not generally recognized: gun shooting, gun shooting, badminton, taekvondo.
We'll always succeed in classic swim style - and we'll probably rule for a long time.
But if I can name my extraordinary favorite, let me remind you of the ingenious magic of trampoline.
Although the jumps on the trampoline Olympic sport since 2000, when they were first mentioned in the games in Sydney, after 16 years of intervention, this sport remains almost unnoticed - many people I have questioned, not even knew it was an Olympic sport.
It can be about regional greed.
The USA never won the trampoline jump medals, and until 2012 none of the athletes got to the final.
Prices in the male category are usually divided between China and Russia and in the female category between China and Canada.
This year the gold medals from London will defend Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
The jumps on the trampoline have yet to be bold, in part because the ear of the unencumbered one will seem to be more suitable at the Clon University than at the Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert, but just a ghost coming from the country.
It has comical potential - the comic vibration of infinite reflection - but also the variety of gymnastics and diving, two sports that combine.
The word "trampoline" is derived from the Spanish word "el trampoline", which means "skokan board".
The aspiring champ jumps on a huge trampoline, which shoots them up to nearly 10 meters and performs compositions with several elements (salt, heat and combination) before finally landing on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic programme, performance, difficulties and "air times" are assessed.
He will compete in Rio with twenty athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The usual route of the Olympic road is ahead.
The gold medalists must go on, faster and even higher, sometimes to the end, elsewhere and back, up and down.
He is trying to pursue not only the target band or the starting wall, but also another line of thought: a world record or an Olympic record.
This one-thinking effort is noble, amazing, a bit fanatical - and enough to lead viewers to tears.
But I think it's kind of exhausting when you're watching the Olympics.
The trampoline jumps in this respect lead to the left.
The track of the athlete on the trampoline is heading up.
I mean, there's no movement forward.
He or she reflects itself as if they were in a state of no weight like astronauts, flying up, then down, and then again with no movement up.
Without competition and, of course, no difficulty, but during the duration of the composition there will be no fierce struggle to achieve the goal, no distance measurement, but only perfect, smooth timing and gravity.
This is just the closest when the Olympics are approaching.
Qualifications and finals of women take place on Friday afternoon, in 13 hours of Eastern Time, then male competitions on Saturday at the same time.
The NBC station will finally be broadcast within the afternoon block, which starts after both days at 14 o'clock.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they promise a peaceful, pleasant time that you will probably overlook through the other matches.
And if I have the attention only to achieve that male athletes will be the subject of loving views and distractions - as Wall Street Journal recently suggested by the US - Logan Dooley is only waiting for his new fans who are breathing.
"Protesting generation" in Ethiopia, the long-standing allies of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political changes in Ethiopia have attacked the violent resistance of the government.
Witnesses claim that many protestors were shot during the meetings with the police.
Is the war threatened in Ethiopia?
In the past decade it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a strong Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
Over the past few months, however, the country has been captivated by anti-government problems that are spreading to more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have gone to the streets demanding fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organisations, the government's reaction was unmerciful.
The witnesses claim that the police shot and killed representatives of unarmed demonstrators.
In the rolling video footage of protests that probably come from the end of last year or early this year, security forces are captured as young people beat holes after being forced to stand at the wall on their hands.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now asking for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and to take a step forward will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, the leader of the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is supported by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopia to eliminate the threat of a terrorist attack in the area, especially in Somalia, and many African countries, if any, receive such assistance from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia has developed at an effective pace.
Its infrastructure has improved in a fundamental way - in the capital of Addis Ababa is even driving a new suburban train.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia can hardly be described as a model of democracy - an organisation fighting for human rights without standing up talking about government repression - opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many of them were pronounced, imprisoned, executed, or banished far into the wilderness.
But it can change.
"When people are choking and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a break," said Seyoum Teshom, who teaches at the university in central Ethiopia.
All young people are protesting.
He's been protesting for the whole generation.
The complaint is a lot and concerns everything from land disputes after absolute control of the power of the ruling coalition.
After last year's elections, which were widely criticised, the ruling party and its allies won the last chair of the opposition held and is now controlling 100 per cent in parliament.
At the same time, there is increasing pressure on the border with Eritrea. The conflict along this inexactly marked border demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Analytics fear that separatist groups, which have been largely suppressed over the past few years, such as the Oroman Liberation Front or the Ogadens National Liberation Front, may try to use confusion and rearm themselves.
There are several factors that explain why these bitter feelings were once again burned down after years of exposure.
The first is apparently harmless: smart phones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate through social networks up to the last few years when they have become commonly available cheaper smart phones and improved the provision of Internet services.
And even though the government bans access to Facebook or Twitter, as is usually the case especially during protests, many people can still communicate via the Internet proxy that hides the position of these people.
Several young Ethiopians talked about how they met in protests.
There is further greater solidarity between Oromy and Amhary, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Arums and the Amhars are not natural allies.
After a long time, Amharic, mostly from the Christian peaks of Ethiopia, emerged in politics and commerce and used Oromas, many of whom are Muslims and live in low places.
But it's changing, too.
"We are on our way to united leadership," said Mulata Gemech, leader of the Oromo.
The biggest protests occurred in the areas of Amhary and Oromy.
Many Amharians and Oromos believe that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by the Tigers, who make up about 6 per cent of the population and control the army, the reporting services, trade and politics.
The third cause of anxiety is the death of Melese Zenawi.
Zenawi, the former leader of the rebels, was the Ethiopian president of the government for the entire 17 years until his death in 2012, when he suffered from the disease.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see the horn.
Analysts say that especially masterly he was able to detect the initial signals of discontent and use the envoys to process and gain on his side.
"The current regime loses basic knowledge," said Abdi, an analyst for the conflict.
The new President of the Government of Ethiopia, Hailmariam Desalegn, was removed from relative ignorance in order to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigris region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he doesn't have confidence in the security services controlled by the Tigers.
Many fear that further bloodshed will result.
Finally, Ethiopia experienced such unrest in 2005 after thousands of people protested against what analysts called the elections that the government took and then stole.
He followed a tough move, during which many protesting deaths - although less than in the past months - have passed rather quickly.
Development experts have assessed the leaders of Ethiopia for visionary infrastructure planning, which is the new suburban train and measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
However, it is quite obvious that the gradual growth of disputes within the Ethiopian government did not stop it.
And it comes to dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month in the Amharic city of Gondar, commercial companies owned by the Tigers and protection against the Tigers on social networks were more and more common.
Analysts say the protests are making the US and other Western allies uncomfortable.
The US government is using Ethiopia as a base for drone crossings over neighboring Somalia, although it has recently declared that the base has been closed.
While the West wants to support democracy clearly, at the same time it does not want its association to collapse in such an uninterrupted area.
"That," said Abdi, "is a very sharp edge of sharpness."
Donald Trump explains his judgment on Obama and the financing of IS as "sarcasmus"
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to bagatize the latest controversy that was waving his campaign, declaring that he did not mean it seriously when several times this week he insisted that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were "the founders" of the terrorist group of the Islamic State.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the Republican candidate to speak clearly to the American public.
He also puts into an unpleasant situation his opponent, who tried hard to defend him in stormy times and must explain that he might not have thought his remarks seriously.
Following this proposal at the Wednesday night meeting, Trump confirmed on Thursday and insisted in the discussions that he really had no intention of saying that President and H. Clinton IS had been created.
However, in a post on Twitter on Friday morning, Trump announced that he was only sarcastic.
The contribution was again claiming an old-fashioned only one day when Trump said in several interviews that his accusations were serious.
When conservative moderator Hugh Hewitt tried to calm down Trump's note by reminding Obama that he was trying to destroy the IS, the Republican candidate did not respond to the president.
The latest storm comes at a time when Trump has tried to focus his campaign on the economy, while his preferences in the pre-election investigations are decreasing.
Trump and Clinton participated in the Michigan duel this week on economic issues.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back to this topic.
On Twitter he warned again that Clinton's proposals were linked to tax increases, and he said her speech was boring.
Trump used sarcasm defense before.
At the end of July, when he raised a wave of criticism when he made a proposal that the Russians should enter Clinton's e-mails, he explained his note later: "I am of course sarcastic."
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and to mitigate them as necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing, to what extent some reports have responded to his clients to find out how they react, and then, according to the reaction, "give an explanation," said Ruth Sherman, a communication specialist who followed the language used by both candidates.
But I also think that it is in turn in its statements, and it knows that they are strong enough to explain them differently.
Because the results of pre-election research in his favor continue to decline, Trump has chosen even more scrupulous tones in recent days, instead of reducing things for general voters.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey, which was published on Friday, showed that Tump is with a high distance behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very close to her in Florida.
Trump is at all trying to avoid apologizing for provocative sayings he says, but often he blames his criticism for misinterpretation of his words or for not understanding his sense of humor.
But along with the fact that Trump has been paying more attention in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have led to an unpleasant situation of his devoted standing, which must be publicly behind him, whatever his remarks are already provocative.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York City, who is one of the most prominent members of Trump, had to defend the content of the CNN interview on Thursday.
"I think what he says is a legitimate political comment," said Giuliani, when asked the credibility of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, IS was almost unknown, a small organization that he wrongly called a novelist, and it came to be because he had withdrawn his army from Iraq.
Most of the ordinary Republicans are trying to argue that Obama's government, in which Clinton acted as foreign ministers, has allowed IS to flourish and has not been able to handle the situation aggressively in the Middle East.
Before Friday's meetings in Pennsylvania Trump continued on Twitter, he had a fire on the media because they were changing every word he said and taking an interest in him.
He spoke to the "poor, pathetic" television students who were trying to understand her and said, "She can't!"
Several Democrats have apologized to Trump for the fact that it is only another proof that he is not eligible for the presidential office.
The coffee shop has been pushed out of the price market.
The coffee shop Verb Cafe was a bustling place in Williamsburg where you could only pay cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee has been served for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed from the front of the house on the Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - a store that Verb replaced in summer 2014 - sells soap in the form of cakes.
The locals mourned it as the last loss of a growing city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea hotel is filled with and now from Verb is a merchant."
But if there's a change in New York, then it's also a reappearance.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than miles north of its original location.
The new Verb has WiFi and accepts payment cards, but there are some of the original employees working there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee's still good, too.
The manager of the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, the long-term employee of the original coffee shop, which is also the owner and executive director of the new place.
He started in Verb in 2001 and stayed until the end.
When one of his customers offered to pay for the move to a new place, he said he would do it with joy.
Rodriguez (36) left many things as they were.
Verb still has the same bakery supplier and bought the same model of espresso machine.
He even used the lights from the old Word again.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try something new.
He's started using new pretenses.
The offer includes sandwiches with ham, egg and cheese and toppings, such as capes and fried onions.
You'll also find a bowl of rice.
The coffee shop no longer supplies beer, but offers you fresh fruit juice.
After nine months Rodriguez noticed a steady stream of original strains.
"A number of original customers from Williamsburg also had to move out because of prices," he said.
Last week there was one of those clients, Rebecca Oliveiro.
Mrs. Oliveiro (34) lived in Williamsburg and went to Verb Cafe often.
She even came when the coffee shop moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I found out that what I like is coffee and culture in Verb," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, but on that day she gave her usual iced coffee a mixed chai, another news.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-term customer, has been going to Verb since 2003.
He goes before work and always orders the same thing.
“In the quarter and eight here every day, like hours, I will come and already prepare my goose with everything and butter for me,” he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add to the offer of a new set.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what he normally orders, but sometimes he puts bacon, eggs and ham on his bunny.
Rodriguez said he didn't regret that the soap shop took his old place.
The truth is, the owners of Soap Cherie offered him to make a special soap for Verb and use filtered coffee from the coffee shop as a supplement.
"I think we could still use it," Rodriguez said.
The traditional Poles also welcomed the Greenpoint café.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place where he would soon show it so that his new neighbors would feel at home.
The new place has other advantages.
Local producers of fruit juices want to pour into bottles and sell filtered coffee.
The possibility is offered to extend the café to the neighboring building.
A lot of customers are enough to get their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the coffee shop closed, his heart broke.
Mr. Whitt says when the coffee shop opened again, going in and having coffee is like coming home.
"I missed the smell," he said.
Depressive food from the time of the crisis - in "Four Meal"
Shortly after his visit to the president's office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat at the Oval Labour Office and lunched.
Butterflies President Roosevelt enjoyed selected food from the 5th Avenue, like a cow's cub and a Maryland turtle soup.
His menu for this day was more modest: eggs in the devil's way in a paradise sauce, potatoes and as a dessert of swedish pudding.
"It was an act of cooking solidarity with the people who suffered," Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message for Americans to eat.”
A couple who live in Brooklyn Heights are devoted to gastronomic history.
The last book of Andrew Coea "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane in her book "97 Orchard" tells the life story of a house on the Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work "A Square Meal", published by Harper on Tuesday, is the history of the American cuisine during the great economic crisis.
They showed their own cook solidarity and met with the reporter at a dinner at Eisenberg's sandwich shop, a little tight buffet in the Flatiron district, which has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with dried olives, Andrew (57) gave him a croc, potatoes and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a meat carbanate that, according to a couple, was excellently suited to the food discussion during the crisis.
"Carbanates were very popular," said Miss Ziegelman.
He was selling burana, liver and pheasant.
They were made from that mixture and other cheap foods that the ingredients set up.
Stop the number of bugs you'd have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe took care of himself.
"They would lie in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years prior to the crisis, the American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was given the form of a buffet of what you are dreaming.
Teams of women cooked for farm workers and for breakfast, lunch and dinner served a freshly baked cake.
They were Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" is watching how the nation coped with the fact that suddenly it was not a land of abundance.
“It was a time when food became the central, feared point for the American people,” Coe explained why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The new budget diet was equally feared: mystery foods, such as carbanates and castrolls, castrolls as "a wonderful way to use the residues," Ziegelman noted, as cooks could hide non-esthetic dishes under the layer of cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat - after many years the central point of American food - became cheaply allocated luxury.
Strange mixtures, which were to serve as calorie and food filling, had the advantage of taste or even healthy cooking.
During the research for a book containing prescriptions, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a time meal of baked onion filled with bura butter.
"It wasn't the favorite increase on the evening table," Andrew Coe said.
Jane Ziegelman stressed: "It was surreal."
Burak butter with baked onion doesn't go together.
It was typical for a lot of home recipes.
As never before and never after, domestic economists - among them Louise Stanley, chairman of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics in 1923 to 1943 - led the country’s eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, invited women to take over the budget, and jokes, such as jam spaghetti with carrots, turned into tasty foods.
The book "A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical events.
First of all, the benefits came from the government's response to its hungry citizens, as well as from President Herbert Hoover's "I'm giving myself a cake".
While publicly praising a simple Iow farm kitchen of his childhood, he served as a chosen millionaire.
"He liked to eat continental cuisine such as fish with corn sauce," Andrew Coe said.
He ate in almost a room, had a tuxedo on him.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably admit the same mistakes if his wife Eleanor didn't take him to be an example of his own stomach.
According to the book, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a houselady who was not interested in the taste at all, which led to the White House being “almost the lowest meal in Washington, but also the most unpleasantly prepared way.”
A series of eating habits from the time of the crisis took off as soon as the land was restored to its feet.
The link remained in our constant test of calories and nutritional values, says Ms. Ziegelman, and in the way science applies to cooking.
Some say that during writing the book they better understood the eating habits of Miss Ziegelman’s mother - perhaps why she could not throw away the food.
"She was really afraid of eating," Andrew Coe said.
Ziegelman noted: “People were wrong.”
There's been an accident with the wreaths.
When there were clean tables at Eisenberg, she and Mr. Coe pulled a dessert that they prepared at home: a Swedish dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called Swedish cream," Ziegelman said and added that the usual trick was to give modest recipes an elegant name.
There was no cream, just sweats, some milk, sugar, water and flour.
Everyone reluctantly threw a spoon into the dense dirt.
Surprisedly, it was wrong.
Andrew Coe added, and then again.
And as a proper owner, he said to his wife, "It would be a bit of a mess."
Europeans: Migrants go for their doses.
Most refugees who apply to Europe come for economic reasons.
Young Russians make fun of themselves.
That's what the series would look like if we turned them around.
A group of Russian artists, called 2D Among Us, is making fun of their home country.
With the help of the camera, they create collages that show funny how it would look if famous shows and movies were filmed in Russia.
Gilead has a claim for reimbursement of the legal representation costs in the case of a patent against type C yellowing against Merck
The Court of Justice has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to pay fees for lawyers who have been incurred in its patent proceedings against type C yellowing against manufacturers of Merck & Co Inc.
In June, the judgment was annulled, according to which Gilead was supposed to pay 200 million for damages for violations of the two Merck patents in relation to the very successful medicines of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the federal judge discovered repeatedly illegal proceedings on the part of Merck, besides lying under oath and other non-ethical practices.
On Thursday, Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman stated that Gilead has a claim to miss the fees incurred in connection with representation in the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the new generation’s drug market against type C glaucoma, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case comes from 2013, when Gilead and Merck complained to each other and claimed to be the owner of basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, an active component of Gilead medicines.
U.S. supported military units claim to have gained full control of the city of Manbídž
U.S.-supported military units gained full control over the northern city of Manbídz near the border with Turkey after the last fighters of the Islamic state fled the city, introducing a group of speakers on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now inspecting the city after the remnant of the radicals who were hiding in the city has left.
The units released more than 2,000 civilians who held radicals, said Reuters Sharfan Darwish from the SDF alliance and the Manbídje Military Council.
"The city is now under our control, but we are still looking for it," said agency Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent
Hillary Clinton published her 2015 tax acknowledgement on Friday, stating that the presidential candidate for democracy and her husband had a revenue of $10.75 million in that year and a real tax of 34.2 per cent.
Clinton spent $1 million on charity in 2015, mainly to the Clinton Foundation. Pastor Bill Clinton contributed to the common cash amount of nearly $5.3 million for lectures, and the former foreign ministry granted $3 million to Simon & Schuster for his book on his foreign ministry.
Clinton's co-legislator, American Senator Tim Caine from Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, published a tax confession in 10 years.
They paid a real tax of 20.3 per cent in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine are still a model of financial transparency," said Jennifer Palmieri, who helped Clinton with the campaign.
Against this, Donald Trump hides himself for false excuses and withdraws from his previous promises that his tax confession will be made public.
It is customary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax confessions, even if it doesn't save them the law.
Trump, a businessman from New York, and his lawyers quoted the audit of the US Treasury Tax Board as a reason for his refusal to publish tax recognition.
"Your move," said Hillary Clinton's campaign supporter on Twitter and linked the tax recognition of a democratic candidate.
Michael Cohen, special adviser to Trump, said on Thursday CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish tax notices until the audits are completed.
According to Trump's criticism, including the Republican candidate for the 2012 President Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party, the refusal raises questions about his net profit, charity contributions, trade transactions and other relations, including relations with Russia.
Clinton is very much on the issue, and on Friday she published a video recalling how the high status of the Republic of Trump is being forced to publish her tax acknowledgement.
On Thursday, he mentioned in his speech on economic issues in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all the other candidates did to the presidential office after decades - to publish his tax confession," he said in front of people.
Politico stated that Trump has paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and the New York Times publicist quoted a number of tax advisers and accountants who claim that this may be the case at the present time.
Federal tax rates have become the subject of the President's election.
Clinton advocates a rule named after billionaire Warren Buffett, which would ensure that everyone who makes more than $1 million a year will pay a tax of at least 30 per cent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, the Buffet at the Clinton meeting in Omaz, in the state of Nebraska, where Buffet's conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, called on Trump to meet and exchange tax concessions.
Buffett said he also went through the IRS audit and that Trump is not "fearing" the financial office, but volunteers.
Clinton's campaign issued tax returns until 2007.
Clinton, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax of 32 per cent and a combined tax of approximately 40.5 per cent between 2007 and 2014.
In 2015, Clinton’s tax acknowledgement shows that unlike most Americans, they earn only $100 in their salaries.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund from which Clinton received dividends and interest of $109,000.

Chilli filled condoms or elephant protection fire extinguishers in Tanzania
Nature defenders in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from walking into human habitats - laying condoms filled with dust from chilli.
This process has proven itself and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, along with the American Environmental Conservation Organization, promotes and educates volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania, using this non-violent procedure to protect their homes and breeds in four steps, without harming animals.
Many of them used a copy to defend themselves.
Friday is a world day of elephants dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since the time they developed this ... tool file, we have seen a change of behavior in these communities. People believe much more that elephants can keep out their fields without harming them,” said the executive director of the Honeyguide Damian Bell Foundation in the statement.
The first and second steps are on the passing elephant to light up the battery and start the clakson.
If it doesn't do it, it's going to get rid of the so-called chilli shell.
Chilli powder mixed with salt with petardo is packed into the condom, its end is absorbed so that it only looks at the knots.
After the fire, the condom will explode and the fine chili powder will spread into the air.
Most of the time there's only one fence and the elephant looks a different way.
The last option is to turn off a fire extinguisher that causes a clear explosion.
The Jewish director rushed to the Berlin hotel for removing the code for calling to Israel at the request of the Arabs - RT News
The French film director of Jewish origin caused a disturbance in the media after finding that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have a code for calling to Israel, according to the employee on the basis of "requirement" of Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, author of a documentary about the Holocaust “Shoah”, ventilated his frustration from the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German daily FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the hotel call code list.
However, the State was not mentioned between the countries where it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel was removed and deleted?
Written by Lanzmann.
Hotel Kempinski Bristol instead offers a call to Israel through its own call center.
The director was looking for an explanation and with the problem he turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received, Lanzmanna, according to his word "shocked".
The hotel employee replied that the measure was "decided after consideration of the management of Kempinski Hotels".
The director's reason for this move was even more puzzling.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they asked to be deleted from Israel's call code," Lanzmann quoted the employee in his letter.
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, the Ambassador of Israel to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the case "a great shame".
We were scared and shocked.
It's a huge shame about itself.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany and also in such a hotel chain is even more embarrassing.
No further explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," he said.
The event triggered a strong online response, people labeled it a scandal.
Some believe that the Kempinski hotel simply "lost" in the demands of Arab customers.
"Your shame," is quoted in another contribution, which indicates that the hotel, which is located on the noble street Kurfurstendamm, is located near the synagogue.
According to the journal Spiegel, the hotel itself quickly rejected any accusation by marking the event as "overview" and to Lanzman as "apologise".
"Never was a direct order issued" does not include Israel in the call code list, says Suddeutsche Zeitung, representative of the Kempinski Hotel.
He adds that the call code was added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber missiles against protesting Brazilian students
The meeting of students and the police took place in San Paulo on Thursday when the students met for a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
The police against the protestant used tear gas and rubber missiles.
The problem got worse when government order services tried to disperse the students, which ended by the police using rubber missiles and tear gas.
The demonstration was attended by several hundred students to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the government's proposals to save money is the closure of almost a hundred public schools and the relocation of 300,000 students.
Some of the participants in the demonstration were able to see how the inscriptions against temporary President Michel Temer were dropped on the wall.
The latest protest comes only a few days after the demonstrators went to the streets together to support President Dilmy Rousseff's session when the Senate in the country decided on her complaint.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian Embassy in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan has increased trade turnover by 70.9 per cent after the lifting of sanctions between Moscow and Tehran.
As the Ambassador pointed out, since the abolition of international sanctions against Iran, there has been an increase in interest by Russian companies trading in the country.
Russian companies are renewing existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Further expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, the turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period for 2015 and reached $856 million.
Specifically, Russia's exports to Iran amounted to 91.5 per cent and reached $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent to $158 million.
The growth in trade has ensured the supply of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the Ambassador said.
Dzagaryan also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iran's citizens, mostly travellers.
Furthermore, Iran was first among the top 20 countries according to the number of tourists arriving in Russia.
It is safe to say that the record numbers of tourists from Iran in Russia from last year will be overcome," he said.
At the same time, however, Iran visits a relatively small number of Russians. The Ambassador hopes that this will change.
"I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where they are in good condition the memories of the ancient Persian civilization," he said.
Scott Callum Skinner rushes home after the British get gold in the cyclist
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered the shadow of glory last night in the male team sprint at the Rio Velodorum when three VB teams defended the title from London 2012.
A 20-year-old relative from Glasgow was in the role of the brake he took as his Scott Sir Chris Hoy, and a young man enjoyed the legend when he arrived at the goal and stole a victory from the favorite New Zealand.
Britain won a surprise four years ago and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And the same trick was repeated after the end of the modest sixth in the world championship in the road cyclist in March, even though Hoy ended his career in the meantime.
The problem between Beijing and London was a payoff for Jamie Staff's specialized leading racer.
So Hindus showed up just in time.
After Hoye left, there was also a place he tried to fill out Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was a man of British coaches and searching for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes, who was with Hoy's champion four years ago, and with Skinner they achieved the Olympic record at the qualification, but took the shirt in the first round of New Zealand.
And the British trio got gold in the team sprint.
Hinds was slightly behind his wheel, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner kept the lead.
The change of strategy was a major part of the transformation when Hindus went to higher translation to slow down and allow Kenny and partly Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy was watching from his position as BBC commentator and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindus came out on stage, he wouldn't let them out of his sight.
Thirty-three-year-old Skinner, a relative from Glasgow, said, "It's a bad comparison."
I'm here to get the best out of myself and honor my name.
We created an Olympic record at the final and we beat the best.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After the triumph next to Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012, Hindus admitted that he had fallen off the track after a bad start.
The note was withdrawn later, and the British opponents had no chance of withdrawing.
There was no such problem this time around this victory.
Hindus said: “With all these British flags on the thrones, I felt like in London.”
In the last three months, we've all been together like a team.
We've lost in many world races, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for a nation that won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If it's supposed to be an indicator of progress in the last five months, then we've been waiting for a successful five days on the highway.
In the form that Kenny presented, it's not unimaginable that he would repeat Hoy's success and win three gold medals at the same time.
This would then be for Kenny - who is just 12 years younger than Hoy's day - also has birthdays on 23 March (this date appears to be sacred for British sports, this day also celebrates the birthdays of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - meant a total of six gold medals and one silver medal.
No matter how much Hoy got.
As next, Kenny will participate in a sprint that starts today and lasts for another three days.
An 18 - year - old relative from Bolton said: “I now enjoy this.
Team race is always the best.
You win with the others.
To tell the truth, winning for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindus said: "If he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knight's title."
It was the only medal competition that day, but the British were still waiting for more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doll qualified as the fastest to compete for the four-mile company race.
We're done with time 3:51,943.
The world record that fell in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and finals (2:42) take place on today's second day of the race, to which Wiggins will focus.
Yesterday before the qualifying competition, he debated with the commissioners when her decision-makers called for a measure of height.
In a similar race, women who continue and finish tomorrow reached Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milgavie the world record with time of 4:13.360.
The VB team relied on its strong team of track cyclists and controlled the mid-term Olympics and won a lot of medals.
After truly exceptional performances, which show a complete balance in Beijing and London, the expectations declined during preparation for Rio.
In the background, dramatic events have taken place, in the final order, the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April for charges of sexism and discrimination, and the termination of a career of great men such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as the first night of the race on the velodrom shows, the legendary reputation seems to be that the team of Great Britain can give a peak power with perfect timing, so it can be confirmed again.
There is no future of a factory in Portland after the energy supply contract
The future of the portland aluminium tavern in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of employees - is not because of the power plant that the company supplies electricity and that has informed about the intention of one of the owners of the tavern to terminate the power supply contract. All power supply contracts are expected to be reduced.
This step is followed by a decision earlier this year by the government of Victoria that it will not extend the granting of grants that the company maintains in progress.
The validity of a permanent 20-year grant will expire in November.
Alcoa Portland may be in danger of up to 2000 jobs.
Up to 2000 jobs - direct or indirect - may be threatened when closed.
And since the tavern consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, there may be other life-threatening effects.
Alcoa closed the Point Henry tavern in 2014, which led to the closure of the English-sea power plant last year.
Alcoa's tavern in Portland is widespread and threatens to close it.
This step follows several years of speculation about the future of the company, initially in response to the strong Australian dollar and recently due to the prices for the production of the race.
AGL, which is a large aluminium tank supplying electricity from Loy Yang A power station in the valley of Latrobe Valley, has stated that it expects some of the other three owners to also decide to terminate the contract.
Alcoa and Alumina are the joint venture owners of most of the competitions, and small commercial shares are held by the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp.
"AGL expects the portland competition to continue to function, in other words, that the demand for electricity from the tavern will continue," she said.
AGL stated that the contracts were so-called ‘insurance contracts’, which were to enter into force as of November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will actually expire in 2017.
‘AGL continues to assume that the contracts will be divided into profits for fiscal year 2017’, the power plant declared.
Any possible impact on AGL’s profits since fiscal year 2018 is currently limited due to the strong market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL stated that it had already written down the value of contracts according to its books of account amounting to $187 million “in case of termination”.
Alcoa stated that the decision to terminate the contract “has no effect on its ... ability to operate a tavern or to secure supply of electricity to a tavern.”
The US company stated that in 2010 it had entered into a contract with Loy Yang for 20 years, which was due to begin to pay as of November of this year, although it still has to explain why it has withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts are very careful when it comes to the possible closure of the portland tavern in Victoria and the Tomago race near Newcastle as a result of a weak economy in the sector.
The head of AGL Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts at the beginning of this week, said that Portland annually consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity and around 900 megawatts of Tomago.
If both companies were to withdraw from the market, this would mean a substantial reduction in demand on the market [electric energy].
It wouldn't be good for us as a manufacturer," he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the real TV show Kardashian - now is the cover of the shining Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), the model and the fourth daughter of the mother-manager of the Kris Kardashian-Jenner clan, appeared on the title page of the September issue of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, Ambassador of Estee Lauder's brand, who presented the fashion weekend in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on his Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, I want to cry in view of this title page," Kendall wrote.
The opening of the title page was followed by a bizarre (or simply continuing humorous in Kardashian?) video, in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (the bar explorers Rob and Caitly and all their favorite show business uncles, the producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest). They forgot their sister's cover just so that the scene could end with a classic twist: they were preparing a secret party.
It's a protected agenda line almost every "birthday" part of a child's television show (Seacrest says: "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the honesty of a cartoon queen in a series at eight o'clock in the morning), but Kris somehow needed to ensure that the other girls could live on this advertisement.
Because when we look at the issue of the magazine Vogue, we must have entered the new era of the Kardashians.
The older sister Kim may have pushed Kendall on the cover of Vogue (she was with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the title of the September issue of the magazine is another league.
The special issue of the magazine Vogue is the most sold year-round issue.
The issue, which reminds its fat more of the book for advertising purposes than the fashion magazine, attracts a whole range of advertisers (Fashionista estimated that from 832 pages in the last edition there were 615 pages with advertising content).
The discovery of a star that appears on the title page is unlikely, so it is not surprising that in the past two years the pictures of the magazine have escaped before its official publication.
Among the women who appeared on the cover in the past are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist or Kate Moss.
In recent years more "celebrity that make models" than "models that are celebrity" have appeared on the title page.
Jennifer Lawrence, the holder of the Oscar and the ambassador of the Dior brand, appeared on the title in 2013, a year later had the honour of Lagy Gaga.
But even though it is very unlikely that Kendall - which magazine describes as her generation's "broken model" - will fall into the first category, will be in a very good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of known people, not the stars of reality shows, or children today who know how to make well-cut videos (even though Jenner represents all of this).
They're provenly talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the title page last year, had one of the strongest years in her career thanks to the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course not everyone is excited about Jenner's success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult because of her participation in reality show.
Stephanie Seymor, the original Victoria's Secret model, criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid in June and called them "the whores of the moment".
These feelings were once again burned up by the report that Jenner appeared on the cover of Vogue.
But this dissatisfaction isn't in place.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of a glowing Vogue.
It's a supermodel in the right sense.
He's leading for Mark Jacobs.
He's selling you make-up from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling you pictures of themselves on their own payroll.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter who took pictures for the Love magazine.
And in free time, it works in reality show, maybe just as one way to see Kurtney and her kids.
Community Legal Aid Centres will reject 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable citizens are denied legal aid every year in the Community centres and are themselves about the effects that will have further financial constraints on the already overloaded services.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly people of advanced age, immigrants, the threats of workers, victims of violence and people without financial means to combat unjust immigration and so on - are rejections already when they seek free legal assistance and representation.
Community legal services, which are already so strained to crack, are about to go for further cuts.
As of June next year, this legal aid centre will lose another 30 per cent of federal funding.
The Director of Community Legal Aid Centres in Queensland, James Farrell, said that according to the latest summary report, the National Association of Community Legal Aid Centres has been found to have been denied five thousand people every year.
Mr. Farrell said the situation would get worse without cancelling the federal government's decision.
"The Community Legal Aid Centres in Queensland are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are denied the vital services they need," he said.
People who have avoided relations with the rapist, people with excessive and protective debts, families undergoing separation, workers who are unjustly released - all these people have legal problems and this report shows that they have no chance of getting the help they need.
Since June 2017, the federal government has reduced funding by 30 per cent, leading to the fact that thousands more of the people at risk from Queensland will have to face difficult legal problems without assistance.
We call on the State Representative and Senator George Brandise to immediately prevent this financial cut-off so that people can get the help they need when they get into legal problems.
In the past year, the government has been committed to ensuring the financing of legal aid up to the level of the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the community centres of legal assistance and the community of their clients and the Government of Palaszczuk must invest in this important work.
A complaint against Donald Trump's campaign after a member of the staff allegedly targeted the weapon
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was prosecuted for alleged inaction after they were informed that the Director of Operations in North Carolina in February directed a gun to a staff member while driving a jeep.
The incident was described in the court file, which was handed over by Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor for a state campaign on Wednesday at the Charlotte State Court.
Bordini said he waited months for the situation to be resolved internally before he concluded that "it won't happen".
Director Earl Phillip "has pointed his finger at the gun, put his right arrow at the gun and directed his head to Vincent in the Czech," Bordini said in a complaint.
The record states that after the complaint on local and regional management, Bordini found that at least four other people had experienced the same thing with Phillip.
"Weapon doesn't have to shoot to cause harm," Bordini said in a complaint.
The complaint comes only two days after the Republican candidate for the president called for a raise when he told the voters in North Carolina that they could imprison the owners and holders of weapons (which is corrected in the United States in the second addendum of the Constitution), if his opponent Hillary Clinton was elected and could appoint his judge.
Trump's campaign says the media pulled his words out of context and that Trump didn't watch violence.
Bordini, in the case, seeks compensation for the carelessness campaign and for Phillip for the threat of personal safety, the illegal use of violence and the causing of emotional harm.
Trump's spokesman, Hope Hicks, did not respond immediately to the comment request.
Trying to get a statement from Phillip was a failure.
WCCB, a local intelligence officer in Charlotte, announced that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
Calling his consulting company Innovative Consulting Services has not been answered in a short time.
The Republican candidate for President Donald Trump is conducting a controversial pre-election campaign.

Britain must expand the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of renewal and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but throughout the country.
For me, Heathrow is enormously attractive, just as London was 2012, when we made extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions will be able to compete from the Olympic Games.
The Olympics meant huge benefits for Startford and East End.
And we'll do it again by creating opportunities for local people and companies near Heathrow.
Only for our local communities will we create 10,000 new places of study, 40,000 new jobs and end the unemployment of young people around the airport.
Just as before the 2012 London Olympics, there will also be events that will think the extension of Heathrow is too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would laugh at the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and even in the case of Heathrow it will be shown that they were not right.
Heathrow can answer every question he has.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that involves many people and companies, not just a few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion pounds, to leave heritage in the form of skills and employment both in the airport and throughout Britain.
We have a great team on Heathrow, who, in time and with the budget set up an infrastructure investment programme of 11 billion pounds, starts with the T5 terminal - which was selected by the world's best terminal five years behind it, after the T2 terminal, which was built between the world's two most troubled wounds.
They are now ready to add a third level, which is worth 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The games in London in 2012 were a huge success in Great Britain and I am convinced that the extension of Heathrow will also be.
It's time to continue to spread the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, secure future trade and leave the legacy of skills and employment that Britain may be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the President of the Board of Directors and former Deputy Minister for Trade in the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in game on cat and mouse in advertising block
Trying to circumvent the advertising blocking programs, for companies that earn online marketing, has become a game of cat and mouse. At least it claims one of the companies that program such software.
On Thursday, that is, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertising filters on its desktop pages, AdBlock Plus on its pages published a post stating that users can update filters in their program and reblock advertising on this social network.
Facebook said on Tuesday that its desktop website will change the coding around advertising to make it more difficult for advertising filters to find out which parts of the website are advertising.
But now Adblock claims that the new codes have already been closed.
Speaking to Adblock Ben Williams in a blog post, he wrote that “this kind of war between the open source community and those who are trying to circumvent it is lasting since the blocking of the ads was discovered” and that Facebook will probably come with another own repair.
The fact that the company that owns the largest social network in the world has been involved in war only proves how big a problem has become to block advertising for industry.
According to a study conducted last year by Pagefair and Adobe, advertising filters around 200 million people worldwide - almost four times before that was in 2013.
Mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of the benefits of Facebook advertising, and every day Facebook from mobile devices visits 1.03 billion active users.
The speaker said, however, that the company goes against advertising filters on the desktops because mobile advertising filters on mobile apps for social networks and Instagram do not work.
Advertising on desktops still represents profit so high that Facebook decides to invest in it.
Facebook also said on Tuesday that it will update the ad preferences tool to give people a better control over how their ads are displayed.
On Thursday, Facebook announced that AdBlock's new filters are worrying them, as they could also block content that does not relate to advertising.
"It is not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem," Facebook spokesperson said in an e-mail statement.
Blocking advertising is an insensitive tool, and that's why we'd rather focus on building tools, such as Ad Preferences, that give control to people.
The woman was hit by a Swiss highway car
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses of an event where on Thursday mornings several vehicles were taken to the highway by a woman who probably tried to commit suicide.
There was an accident at the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight on Thursday.
The police in Vaud stated in a statement that the actor "unfortunately committed" was lying in the dark on the road and took several cars.
Clearly, the victim, a 49-year-old woman, wanted to kill herself and hit her with several cars, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been heard, but according to the police, not all of them have been identified yet. The police are calling these drivers and all the others who have witnessed an accident to log in.
A criminal investigation was opened, a "logical" step in a situation such as this, said to Le Tribune de Geneve legal representative Gilles Hofstetter.
It is still necessary to find out if any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent the attack?
This must be found by the plaintiff," Hofstetter said.
On the basis of two similar cases in the past five years, drivers do not appear to be responsible.
In both cases - one of which was the person who was on the road - it was decided that motorists cannot expect a pedestrian who walks the road in the middle of the night, as the newspapers have said.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of the charge of neglect after he struck and killed a man on the A1 motorway near Paynerne in the night of August 2014.
The court found that the victim had been drinking alcohol at the age of 22 and had been missing on the road.
The Court found that the police officer - who responded to the emergency call - was in a reasonable manner and that the presence of a man on the road was "a very exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information on the quarter incident that occurred at Morges should report to the police on the telephone numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Tolerant city.
Praha is the popular destination of the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Offices and Agency (AČCKA) expects up to 20,000 visitors to Prague within Prague Pride.
On Friday, the Executive Director of AČCKA Kateřina Petříčková announced it.
The sixth anniversary of Prague Pride began on August 8th, the festival is bringing the lives of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals (LGBT).
Last year, about 35,000 people attended the event.
"Praha belongs to the most popular destination of the LGBT community, which is for a high level of tolerance and a wide range of specialized companies," Petríčková said.
According to the survey, foreign visitors lose an average of 3100 crowns per person per day.
Gay tourists are available to support their travel special maps Prague with a complete list of Prague gays and gay-friends bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile apps etc.
"For travel, LGBT customers generally pay that they are very lucrative, are interested in staying in higher price relationships with a high standard of travel services and are losing more than others," Petríčková said.
The first Pride Tourism Symposium is also taking place during the festival program.
Experts from the LGBT transport sector from Europe, the USA and China are presenting it.
The festival will continue until Sunday, 14 August.
The main theme this year is love, but the event will also focus on several thematic areas, including families, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The festival will be the highlight of the traditional route with allegorical cars coming from Václav Square in Latvia on Saturday.
The outcome, attended by thousands of people last year, this year, will be a minute of silent remembrance of the victims of a black attack in the Orlando Night Club, where the attacker shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Matt celebrates forty years.
The invincible boxers Pat and Matt, whose effort usually ends with disaster, have enjoyed small and large viewers for forty years.
The pilot part of this evening's show by director Lubomír Beneš was premiered on 12 August 1976.
Following the creation of this animated series, which now knows viewers in more than a hundred countries of the world, were cartoons by the artist and director Lubomír Beneš, who designed for the magazine with two boxes of Mr. Oholička and Mr. Sedleč.
Beneš then called for the cooperation of dramatist Jiří Kubíč and artist Vladimir Jiranka and jointly created a film by the Kučáč.
Today's image with a yellow and red trick and a bullet and a radio was created in 1979, when he started a series for Slovenian television in the short film Prague.
The names Pat and Matt were then given in 1985, this time it was already directly for the Short Film Prague.
In 1990, Lubomír Beneš founded his own studio of the animated AIF Studio film in Prague and Curych, where other parts were created.
After his death in 1995, other works continued with other creators, many of whom were shared by Beneš ’ son Marek.
There are now more than ninety episodes of the stories of these boxers, with which all the soups under their hands, but never get angry and are always filled with optimism, ideas and custodial enthusiasm, and finally they are satisfied with their work, which puts a well-known gesture "...and it is!".
Pat and Matt even moved from television to books, to DVD and to the theatre and to the toy or other toys with Pat and Matt's image are the speed of every toy.
A story for Fiji and a two-year-old Harmony.
At the end of the week, there's a puzzle, we've chosen one sport and one of our lives for you.
They both have a good ending.
Let's see.
Fiji has achieved historic success.
What is the cause of the joy of the whole country?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and she's happy with her.
And for what things do people lose most at airports?
It's a Friday review from the world web sites.
First medals from the Olympics.
Historical success celebrates the island state of Fiji.
Ragby's selection of this joint defeated the British team in the finals of the seven-week football tournament.
It's such a first medal that Fiji won for herself at the Olympics.
Waiting for the winning of the first precious metal lasted sixty years since sending the first expedition to the Olympics.
Coach Fiji is a great credit for success.
It's ironic, though, that Brit Ben Ryan is.
The team has been running since 2013 and after the final so that the British citizen could be satisfied unlike his countrymen.
"Let's play free and easy and see if we can handle the biggest game in our history," the coach announced before the finals.
In the end, Fiji's sovereign rule and small state with 900 thousand inhabitants now has an Olympic history.
The report was brought by the French daily Le Monde.
A new friend and good luck for a little girl.
Two-year-old Harmony-Rose Ivy Allen, who's been living with no hands and no legs for 11 months, has got a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mummy, she's like me," the two-year-old girl was delighted to discover her mother for ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to take off her arms and legs and then sit together without prosthetics.
Harmony has been diagnosed with meningitis type B for a few years, with doctors giving her only a 10% chance of survival.
There's nothing I wouldn't love about her.
She's beautiful, smart, funny, and she never gives up.
He's got surveillance, too.
I've seen her introduce herself to the other children with the words Hello, I'm Harmony, and I don't have a hand, added my mother.
Look at the joy of the doll.
What do we lose most at the airport for?
CNN brings in a finding that people at airports lose the most for packaged water.
The sales chain Hudson's travel essential stores has published data in the last year, where it collects 10 products that customers in its airports stores buy most frequently.
The water was the sovereign first.
Drinks were generally very popular, in the first decade they were placed eight.
The ninth place contained a large package of M&M beans with coconut flavor.
And you can figure out who's closing the first ten?
As one of the above, you can't eat.
According to CNN, it's The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among the magazines are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
The Sovereign of the universe.
We're just going to win, they were laughing at Murray and Bond.
Eric Murray and Hamish Bond, from New Zealand, have sovereignly ruled the category of two without a sailor for seven years, and their Dominants have also confirmed in the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At first sight, the inexperienced couple moved to a smaller team after the Beijing Olympics and have been running out of competition since 2009.
At the Rodrig de Freitase lagoon, they scored 69th in a row at the quarter final.
What are we in other than the others?
We're just pretty, Murray's been hilarious during the Olympic regatta, when he was supposed to answer questions about the Dominant of the New Zealand Twin.
Frankly, we don't do anything different to each other.
We just practice hard, hard hard.
And we're always trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy, said Murray more seriously.
Their sovereignty is remarkable and because they are physically different.
Murray is almost two meters and a stochial watch, the academically looking Bond is five centimeters smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
Besides, they have a different nature.
Bond studies and deals with finance, Murray has a charity boxing game behind him, for example.
That's why she doesn't spend too much time together.
Eric's on his way to the ship basically because we can't lose.
We're just gonna win.
I have a tendency to think about what might happen, he admitted Bond, who, even at the press conference, apparently suggested that the dominant in the crew is Murray.
He always responded as the first and Bond waited for his opportunity.
But on the water, the enemy destroys the calm force.
They're running their pace, and although often in the middle of the track they're not in the lead, at their progressive acceleration, the opponents haven't found a prescription yet.
We're running on a two-mile track, and we never wanted to go the first mile up.
We're just trying to go at a pace that no one else can.
We know what we have to do to win, said 40-year-old Murray.
With his four-year-old younger partner, he won seven gold medals at the world championship.
They also triumphed in 2007 when both members were gold four without a rudder.
Just after the unexpected failure, larger teams at the Beijing Olympics decided to move to the two without a driver.
At the London Olympics, it is likely that the biggest defeat their careers opened and the Dominants confirmed it in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us, and they didn't ask for anything.
This time it was a little more fun.
We knew it would be damn hard, and we had to make sure we were mentally well, Murray said.
We know that we're all about to be thrown out of the throne.
We still have the target on our back.
But we're trying to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to the projections of the new NASA climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model for testing Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether once on Venus, the surface of which is hot, without water and the requested CO2, could have been subject to conditions similar to those on Earth.
Scientists have previously suggested that the low speed of turning Venus can explain its dense atmosphere.
According to the latest simulations, though, Venus could ever boast of a rare atmosphere like Earth and then slowly turned around.
The model also dealt with the previous Venus topography.
The planet was probably dryer than on Earth, but once it had enough water and geographical diversity to control its life and provide protection against rapid extinction.
Venus used the sun, which was 30 percent denser.
"In the simulation of the GISS Venus model, during slow rotation, exhibits its daily side to the sun almost two months at once," explained a scientist from GISS Anthony Del Genio in a new report.
This results in the heating of the surface and the production of rain, which creates a dense layer of clouds that are treated as rainforests and protect the surface from excessive solar heat.
The result is climate with average temperatures, which are actually slightly lower than at present on Earth.
The model compiled the story of Venus similar to the evolution that was previously hypothetically composed by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was probably habitable in the past -- over a few billion years -- it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans were drained and water pairs were burned by ultraviolet light.
The hydrogen escaped and remained only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly effect of greenhouse gas -- that's Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers published their findings from the new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters magazine.
Patrick Roy resigned to the Colorado Avalanche team's position
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday to his position as coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche hockey operations team, as a reason for not participating in the decision-making process on team issues.
Executive Vice President/General Manager Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed the move and stated that the club will start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years I have acted as chief coach and vice president of hockey operations for Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and decision," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
For a long and intense time, I've been thinking about how I can improve the team, give him the depth he needs, and get it to a higher level.
To achieve this, it is necessary that the vision of the coach and the vice-president of hockey operations be in line with the vision of the organisation.
It must also be able to participate in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who accepted Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his team benefits.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated for Jack Adams' championship as the best league coach during his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
He brought the team to 112 points and first place in the Central Division. However, Colorado met Minnesota in the first round of the play-off and during the last two years he had not always won the matches after the season.
The Avalanche team in the 2015/2016 season scored 39:39:4 and he missed five points to get a second wild card at the Western Conference.
Branchman Roy, who wrote down his fame, won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with Montreal Canadiens and twice with Avalanche.
Employees on the North Sea oil rig renew conversations and interrupt
The senior representatives of the parties concerned indicated that the salaries for the North Sea oil platform workers were suspended, while all the parties to the dispute agreed on a new round of negotiations.
At the stand against the Wood Group oil field service company, there was a sporadic presence on the platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"The Wood Group and the Joint Committee organisations and RMT may confirm that they have agreed to renew the current dispute resolution process," the statement states.
Starting next week, we'll have a few weeks of whole-day meetings in the coming weeks, where we'll try to look at the problems from the new angles.
According to the trade unions, their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, to protest against wage cuts up to 30 percent.
Wood Group this year reduced the rates and paid its suppliers in the North Sea by about 9 per cent less due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in the rates of companies comes after a 10% reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company claims that further discounts would allow companies to compensate for the market decline.
On the other hand, Shell cut out thousands of people's payroll and announced plans to abandon oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries due to the modernisation of its processes - immediately after the mega fusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from the low oil prices, the economic situation associated with Britain's June decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of this week, a member of Parliament from Scotland, Dave Anderson, met with committee speakers to discuss one of the biggest work accidents of the entire generation that led to the North Sea situation.
The North Sea, as he said, is vital for the economy in the region.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just for some," he said.
For comparison, in 2016, almost $1.4 billion of investments in new projects in the North Sea are expected, while the average over the past five years was about $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of star rotation in Pleiades
Kepler's latest mission of space telescope to help astronomers is to get an almost complete list of star rotation speeds from Pleiade's star cluster.
New data helps astronomers understand why the stars in the constellation revolve at different speeds, and also how the time of rotation is related to the formation of the planet.
"We hope to learn more about the relationship between the star mass, its age and even history in its solar system by comparing our results with other stars," said Luis Rebulová, a research workshop at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The Pleiade Star Cup is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many stars in the crowd are now reaching the state of adulthood and have been born over 125 million years.
Now it's turning faster.
At maximum speeds, these adult stars release huge amounts of star wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a slowing effect.
Along with the age of the star, its speed of rotation is slowing down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star so that he measures the time between the discovery of recognizable points on the stars -- similar to the sun's rays.
According to the latest data on the speeds of rotation, larger stars turn slower than less massive stars.
The rebel compares stars to dancers, making pirates slower than those.
"In the "ballet" Pleiade we see that the moving stars are slower and more massive, while those that are the fastest are usually very light stars," Rebullova said.
Because the Pleiåd Star Cup is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the quality of stars and the speed of rotation.
"The plywoods provide us with an angle for the theoretical models of star rotation in both directions, among the younger and older stars," Rebullova said.
There is still much we want to learn about when and why the stars slow down their speed of turning and so saying "hang their dance shoes on the back".
Rebulous and her colleagues have described in detail the latest speed analysis of Pleiades in three studies, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is a qualification agreement necessary?
If I didn't sign up, then the qualification agreement wouldn't be closed and after a few months I could go to another hospital?
Is it really possible to work after study without applying for special education?
I am concerned that in the area where I would like to work, there is now a job-free place in a slightly more distant hospital, but about half a year could be set free in another place where I would like to work.
So I don't know how the situation is going to solve about half that, so the question continues.
Mrs. Lenka Vlk's answer.
There is no legal obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with an employer - a hospital.
The Qualification Agreement shall be a legal institution governed by the labour law and may be concluded between the employee and the employee in order to ensure the reimbursement of the costs incurred in connection with the increase or deepening of the qualification of the employee.
In the field of health, long-term pressure is being put in place not to conclude these agreements with a view to ensuring the labour mobility of health workers and not all hospitals at the moment require this agreement.
According to Act No 95/2004, the conditions for the acquisition and recognition of professional qualifications and specialised skills for the performance of the medical profession of a doctor, dental doctor and pharmacist, while expressly validating that participation in special education is considered to be a deepening of qualifications (not to mention an increase in them).
This means that a qualification agreement can be concluded under the labour law only if the costs reach at least 75,000 KZK.
There is no legislation or obligation to apply for special education.
The law only lays down the conditions for the application for inclusion in the field of special education.
However, the doctor is permitted under the law to perform the doctor’s profession by completing the required university degree, although under the statutory conditions (under the professional supervision of the doctor with specialized skills in the relevant field).
The law provides for a situation where professional practice in another field of specialisation may be included in a doctor’s special education if its content and scope correspond to the relevant educational programme.
Theoretically, it would be possible to calculate the time worked out elsewhere, which would correspond to the situation of the farmer.
However, given that I do not know the circumstances of this case, it may be recommended to consult with the Ministry of Health (Scientific and Medical Committee) concerned, since the Ministry of Health provides legal advice and consultation services related to the inclusion in special education and its course.
The advisory service also provides free of charge the Czech Medical Chamber, which must be a member of each doctor.
Doctors from Syrian Halab ask for U.S. intervention.
The United States did not make any effort to end the siege (the constitutional part of the city by the government) and did not use its influence to defend civilians, quoted from a letter addressed to the White House of the AFP Agency.
"We do not need tears, compassion, and even prayers; however, we desperately need to create an airless zone over the East Halab in order to stop the attacks, and we need international action to ensure that Halab will not be surrounded again," the doctors said.
The Russian forces, which support the army of faithful President Bashar Asad, have announced that they will stop every day for three hours of attacks in the area of Halab in order to allow a safe passage of humanitarian convoys.
From 9:00 till 12:00 SELČ are to be stopped all military activities, air strikes and gunfire.
Although the head of UN humanitarian operations Stephen O'Brien welcomed it, he stressed the need for at least two-day precautions.
According to the AFP, 15 of the 35 doctors who act in the eastern part of Halab were already in control of the rebels.
It says that during the five-year war, witnesses were violent, cruel deaths of countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world looks at and finds how complicated Syria is, but it's only doing little to protect us.
Recent offers of evacuation of residents from the Syrian regime and Russia sound like only slightly closed threats, suffered by pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors.
Doctors reported that 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria were reported last month, 15 of them in hospitals where they were working.
The saddest thing is that we have to decide who will live and who will die.
At our emergency, small children come to us with such serious injuries that we have to choose among them those who are most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don't even have the material we need to help them, the doctors describe.
Two weeks ago, four newborns were drowned when the explosion interrupted the supply of oxygen to their incubators.
They were breathing and then their lives ended - before they could really start, they remembered.
The army loyal to President Bashar Asad, supported by the Russian forces, surrounded the rebels in recent weeks by the ruling eastern part of Halabu, was on the inside without food supplies to over 200,000 people.
Rebels who are under constant blows of Russian and Syrian flight managed to break and start anti-fungal on Saturday after three weeks.
Both sides then arrived in the city and its surroundings were strengthened.
