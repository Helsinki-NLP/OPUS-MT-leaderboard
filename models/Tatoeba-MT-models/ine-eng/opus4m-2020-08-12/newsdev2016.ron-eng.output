The former head of the Brazilian presidential cabinet is brought before the court
On Tuesday, a federal judge accepted the charges brought against the former head of the Brazilian presidential cabinet for supposed involvement in a massive corruption scheme for the Petrobras state oil company.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office said Jose Dirceu will be sent to trial for corruption, fraud and money laundering charges brought this month.
Other 12 persons will be tried, including Joao Vaccari Neto, the former Treasury of the Employers' Party, in power in Brazil, and Renato de Souza Duque, the former president of Petrobras' business services.
Dirceu is the oldest member of the Employers' Party in the government held in custody for the links to this scheme.
Dirceu served as the head of the cabinet of former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva between 2003 and 2005.
He was arrested at the beginning of August at home, where he was already under house arrest, with an 11-year penalty for engaging in a voting scheme in Congress more than 10 years ago.
The prosecutors stated that Dirceu had developed a bribe scheme at Petrobras, accepted bribes while it was in operation and continued to receive payments from entrepreneurs after it was closed at the end of 2013 for the scandal of the votes purchased.
According to prosecutors, the Petrobras scheme involved approximately $2 billion in bribery and other illegal funds.
Some of that money would have returned to the campaign fund of the ruling party and their allies.
It would also include bribery to Petrobras directors in exchange for covered contracts.
"Miracle recovery" of a student survivors of the Peshawar massacre
A paralyzed teenager after being shot four times in the most violent terrorist attack in Pakistan succeeded in a "miracle recovery" after following treatment in the United Kingdom.
Ibrahim Khan, 13 years old, was told by the doctors in Pakistan that he would never be able to go again.
At least 140 people, most children, were killed when armed men attacked the public school of the Peshawar army last December.
Mohamed, who arrived in London last month for surgery, will be expelled later from the hospital.
Exactly nine months ago, on a usual Tuesday morning, Mohamed was sitting at the first aid hour and listening carefully to his teachers.
Right then, seven armed men dressed in the uniforms of the guards enter the army's public school.
They carried hundreds of explosives and had to carry out a simple mission: to kill all the men, women and children who were on their way.
"I can't forget what happened that day," Mohammed said with a sharp look.
I was sitting in the amphitheatre, asking questions... and then I heard firearms outside.
The terrorists came in and began to kill. Our teacher was burned alive.
Mohamed describes how he took four students out of the amphitheatre while the carnage was taking place.
Then he says he heard his friend Hamza yell at him.
She said, "Oh, brother, save me."
I held his hand.
Then I was shot in the back, and he was in the head.
Most of those killed in the attack were students
Hamza died in Mohammed's arms.
Mohamed remembers that immediately after that he fainted and that the next thing he knew was that he was on a hospital bed, paralyzed from the bridge down.
Doctors from Peshawar in northern Pakistan, then Rawalpindi, near the capital, told their families that there is no treatment and that it will never go.
"When I saw him, I felt my soul coming out," says Sher Khan, Mohamed's father.
Those nine months were the hardest of my life.
But Khan and his wife, Sherbano, refused to believe that their son would never be able to use his legs so passionately.
They made a campaign and asked for help from Pakistani television, attracting the support of famous people like Imran Khan, a become political cricket player.
Eventually, they managed to raise funds to take Mohamed to the United Kingdom and provide treatment to the private Harley Street clinic in London.
The neurosurgeon Irfan Malik described Mohammed as "fearful" when he arrived at the hospital.
"It's spent the last few months sleeping in bed without being able to move from one side to another," Malik says.
He was weak, he put a lot of pressure on his back.
She wasn't in a good shape.
A vertebra from Mohammed's spine was destroyed
Mohamed had been shot in the shoulder, in the shoulder and in the back during the attack, and his lower spine had been destroyed, leading to paralysis.
During a six-hour operation, however, Malik and his team were able to re-edit the nerve endings and rebuild the destroyed part of the column.
Even Malik was surprised by what happened next.
Just a week after the operation, Mohamed got up and began to take steps and walk.
We didn't expect such a good result.
It was a miracle," he says.
In less than two weeks of operation, Mohamed is ready to leave the hospital and start the long recovery process.
Mohamed challenged fate and began to walk again
He wants to become strong and continue his studies in the United Kingdom.
But it is determined to return to Pakistan, to join the army and fight terrorism.
"I feel I still have a chance to live," he says, showing the images with weapons drawn by him next to school manuals and pens
Physically, Mohamed gets stronger every day, but the psychological trauma he's going through is unimaginable.
"My anger has not diminished," he confesses.
In my school, little children were killed.
What crime did they commit?
His mother wipes out a tear, hands him over and says, "I see my son walking again."
He'll be able to keep his life going.
Service 4G "Super Voice" from Three offers a better signal
Three uses a 4G spectrum with a lower frequency, which can cover a wider area
Mobile telephony provider Three has launched a service in the United Kingdom that says it will improve reception within buildings and rural areas without signs.
The 4G Super Voice service allows customers to make calls and send text messages using a spectrum with a lower frequency.
Other networks intend to introduce the same technology, known as "Voice Over Long-Term Evolution (VOLTE)".
This currently only works with Samsung Galaxy S5, but recent iPhone phones will benefit from it in the coming months.
Three points out that up to 5.5 million customers will have access to service by 2017.
Head of Technology, Bryn Jones said: “By the end of the year, one million of our customers will have access to better indoor coverage and will be able to use their phones in more places than they have ever been".
The sights are prepared for the pantomime season
Pantomime season is very important for theatres throughout the United Kingdom, many of them preparing for this year's season.
Now, at Christmas Theatre, some of the biggest names in show business take part.
Matthew Kelly and Hayley Mills will appear in the Cenuse - the first in the role of one of the wicked sisters, and the second in the role of the wicked.
They reveal the secrets of their pantomime at BBC Breakfast.
Steven Wilson: "If I don't do anything, I feel guilty"
Steven Wilson was recently appointed as the major winner of the Progressive Music Awards
Steven Wilson was often called the most hardworking musician in the progressive rock world.
The musical talent won three awards at the Progressive Music Awards, which took place this month in London, including the award for the best album of the year for Hand.
In his five-star review, The Guardian called the album "an intelligent, expressive and captivating work of art".
Since the 1980s, Wilson has been the engine of many music projects, the most famous of which is the Porcupine Tree rock band.
Now, before two shows with the house closed at Royal Albert Hall, Wilson launches a double LP only in vinyl format, Transience, to show the "more accessible" side of his solo activity.
He told the BBC about his love of vinyl and his program loaded and explained how comedy actor Matt Berry got to open his shows.
What does it mean to you?
I grew up right at the end of the vinyl era, and I remember that I was just waiting for the CD to appear, because the vinyl was so annoying.
You bought a record, went home with him, had a scratch, and you had to bring it back.
I love CDs, and for certain types of music, for example, classical, they're better than vinyls.
But the problem with CDs and digital downloads is that there's nothing else to really appreciate.
Having a vinyl is like having a nice picture attached to the supply.
It's something you can hold in your hand, while you're getting absorbed in verses and wrapped up in the artistic act.
I thought it was just a nostalgic thing, but it doesn't have the way to be if some kids too young to remember their vinyls like this kind of experience.
Do you have any wine you especially have?
I admit I got rid of all the vinyls in the '90s.
All the wine we have been bought again.
I started from the idea of restoring the collection I had at the age of 15, but I went beyond that.
The first disc I convinced my parents to buy was out of the Blue from the Electric Light Orchestra.
If I still had the original, it would have had sentimental value, but unfortunately, it's somewhere through a charity store.
Steven Wilson hopes the album will be a doorway to possible new fans
Why did you launch your new Transience compilation on vinyl?
This was originally conceived as an idea for the Day of Discourse Shops, but I missed the opportunity.
My house of speeches suggested to gather some of my shortest and most accessible melodies.
I've come to be easily obsessed with the idea of doing some kind of "introduction into Steven Wilson's music" and I kept the project intact so that it could only be launched on the vinyl.
Who buys the vinyl also receives a variant downloaded to the high resolution.
Are you worried that the album won't show your music in its true light?
No, because, although I focus on longer music, there's something I've always appreciated more than anything: the melodic part.
There is a lot of progressive rock that focuses on the technical complexity rather than the melodic side.
Pink Floyd, the most famous progressive rock band of all time, passed the time test because they always put emphasis on the melodic and the atmosphere.
What are you preparing for Albert Hall's shows?
I don't want you to reveal too much.
The directory will be completely different in each of the nights.
In the first place, there will be a version of the show Hand. Wase. which I had this year, but steroids, with a few guests.
The second night will be rather an incursion into my history, it will be more oriented towards the fans who have been following me for years.
How did you choose Matt Berry to open your show the other night?
And me and the others on the tour team are big fans of [the comedy series from Channel 4] Toast of London, to the point where we give the whole time mentioned from it.
I also thought to listen to Matt's music, so I bought his album, Music for Insomniacs.
I talked to him about our common love for Mike Oldfield and asked him to sing at the Royal Albert Hall.
I think I'm extremely lucky to have him in the open.
You dropped albums from such groups as XTC, Tears for Fears and Yes.
How much does this affect your own music?
I'm not consciously inspired by this, but inevitably, when you deconstruct these classic albums, they stay in your mind.
My last solo album, The Raven That Refused to Sing, was, without a doubt, the most progressive old school album I ever created.
I don't think it was a coincidence that I remixed King Crimson, Jethro Tull and Yes almost all year before.
The current album, Hand. Wase., it's much more open, because I was working on Tears for Fears and XTC.
You are often described as the most busy progressive rock musician.
Is that how you feel?
You can delete the progressive word.
I think I'm probably one of the most obsessed people in today's music world and I'm not saying that with pride, because, please believe me, it's a curse.
I think I inherited this from my father, who has a ethics of incredible strength.
If I don't do anything all day, I'm starting to feel guilty.
That's why working on remixes was a gift, because it means I don't have to just do my music all the time.
The music industry is a hard place to make a career.
Now I wouldn't recommend this to anyone as a profession.
I work every day and I'm not rich, but I live well.
I love what I do, it's a privilege, but if I were lazy, I don't think I'd survive.
Transition will be launched in the United Kingdom on 25 September.
Steven Wilson will play at the Royal Albert Hall on 28 and 29 September, as part of his European tour 2015-2016.
A new contract brings jobs to Skytrans
The new Skytrans re-engaged part of the airline's staff who lost their job when the old Skytrans failed.
Skytrans, a restored company in northern Queensland, has awarded it a $25 million contract to transport the natural gas company's employees to QGC, which meant that 18 crew members recovered their jobs.
Skytrans, a company owned by the Wild family, became very active in January after the Newman government rewarded the subsidized routes that constituted a large part of the airline's business.
Falmiment made several communities face an isolated potential, and Warren Entsch, a national-liberal federal parliament for northern Queensland, was the representative voice of criticisms of the national-liberal government.
Another company, Collings Aircraft Holdings, relaunched the Skytrans brand in March.
Michael Thine, executive director of Skytrans, said the airline contract with QCG has already created jobs.
"We have managed to re-engage 18 Skytrans staff members as pilots and crew members," he said.
We are also pleased to have a new staff, with direct logistics experience in managing flight operations for QGC clients.
In just five months, we got married with 100% labour force, 78 staff members being employed in Cairns and now in Brisbane.
The contract aims to extend Skytrans’s flight operations from its headquarters in Cairns, which serves the York Head and the Torres Strait, and to include a base in Brisbane.
Skytrans will operate 18 return flights a week for QGC personnel and for entrepreneurs from Brisbane to locations in Chinchilla and Taroom, on his Dash-8 flights from 36 places, starting on Monday, October 26.
Tony Nunan, QGC Executive Director, said Skytrans received the contract following a tender procedure.
"We are pleased that this contract will contribute to the expansion of a company in Queensland," he said.
The Skytrans contract maintains its high-quality and consistent flight services to support our operations and projects.
Liberal parliamentary and fresh Mummy Kelly O'Dwyer gets the advice to make a bigger reserve of milk to avoid missing votes in the Chamber
Looks like there's gonna be more women in the office.
Malcolm Turnbull's new government will be invested on Monday and there are strong signs that more women will occupy the portfolios.
One of the visions of the government's rise, Kelly O'Dwyer, has received counsel to make a bigger reserve of milk for her newborn to avoid breast-feeding taking part in her Parliament's duties.
The advice comes from the government-sponsored officer, Scott Buchholz, who later consulted his Labourist counterpart to find out what is the most appropriate approach for a nursing parliament, in accordance with the regulations in force.
Liberal Parliamentarian Kelly O'Dwyer and her daughter Olivia.
In accordance with the regulations in force - the set of rules governing the behaviour of parliamentarians in the Chamber - the nursing mothers obtain a vote in Parliament.
This means that their vote is considered valid even when they are not present in the Chamber.
But Whip didn't know about this exemption until he consulted the opposition officer Chris Hayes on this issue.
Things got worse on two occasions, when O'Dwyer was unable to participate in a division meeting and could not fulfill his obligation to give a speech because he had just begun breast-feeding.
On one of these occasions, her team was asked if the parliamentary thought of making a bigger milk reserve instead of breast-feeding.
Scott Buchholz, Parliamentarian of Queensland, is responsible for government discipline.
Later, the two resolved their dispute.
Both refused to comment when contacted by Fairfax Media, but separate sources by Buchholz and O'Dwyer told Fairfax Media that the representative of the Higgins division was angry when she was told to make a bigger milk reserve instead of breast-feeding her daughter, Olivia, born in May.
This is revealed even when new Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is working on the construction of his new cabinet.
Buchholz, the Liberal National Parliamentarian of Queensland, was promoted under the responsibility of former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, as part of the negative effect of the trial of censorship in February of this year.
O'Dwyer, in image by Amanda Rishworth of the Labour Party and her son, Percy, is one of the three moms in Parliament.
The former disciplinary officer, Phillip Ruddock, was removed only a few days after Abbott faced a motion of censorship by which he wanted to be removed from office, being replaced by Buchholz.
Another supporter of Abbott, Andrew Nickolic, liberal of Tasmania, was also promoted and appointed responsible for accompanying discipline.
Nickolic recently held the first page of the papers, after discovering that he had sent Turnbull a message in which he was asking him to refuse to challenge Abbott's leadership.
In August, O'Dwyer returned to Parliament for the first time after her daughter Olivia was born in May.
It is one of the three parliamentarians who have become mothers this year.
The spokesperson for the Labour Party, Catherine King, said on Wednesday that the vote for nursing mothers was introduced when her son was a baby.
"Now she's [seven]," she wrote on Twitter.
The disciplinary officer should have known.
O'Dwyer was promoted in the cabinet at the end of last year and can be promoted under Turnbull, who said Wednesday that he wants more women in his office.
"No one wants more than me to see more women in power, influence, in Parliament, in the ministry, throughout the country," the prime minister said in front of reporters in Parliament.
Abbott included a single woman in his first cabinet and, after the pressure sustained to increase female representation in the Coalition, promoted a second woman in the cabinet after the stay of December.
Five things the business environment wants from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull
Malcolm Turnbull: How will markets react?
Mal Maiden, an editor at BusinessDay, examines the impact Malcolm Turnbull could have on Australia's business sector.
On Tuesday, lobbying groups in the business sector did not know how to manifest their enthusiasm more strongly when Malcolm Turnbull took over the country's freshness as prime minister.
The main reason is that a large part of what many of them would have wanted to see was abandoned under Tony Abbott's leadership.
Or simply came into a suspension negotiated due to Abbott's political "crash-or-crash-through" style.
The representatives of the interest groups spoke at the union about their hope in Turnbull's ability to satisfy the public interest, to reach a political agreement and to do things well.
So what exactly does the country's largest companies and their representatives expect from our new prime minister?
ChAFTA will be a first test of Turnbull's ability to exceed negative advertising.
Turnbull himself set the free trade agreement with China as an initial objective.
In his first speech in which he announced that challenge on the media, the Free Trade Agreement between China and Australia (ChaFTA) represented the central point of his attack on Labour leader Bill Shorten.
In a speech in August, Turnbull criticised the "revolving outbreaks of economic chauvinism" by the Labour Party regarding the problem and expressed concern about the racist temptation of the critics.
"In the context of ChaFTA, the winners are, numerically, much more than losers," he said in the same speech.
The business environment hopes that he will win this debate.
Don Argus, the legendary business environment representative, stressed that this is an essential point, supported, among others, by the Australian Business Council (which represents the largest 100 companies in the country) and by James Packer, the billionaire in the gaming industry.
The business environment wants to conclude this agreement, and it will be a first test for Turnbull's ability to exceed negative advertising and negotiate with the whole Senate.
The Minister for Small Enterprises, Bruce Billson, supports the recommendations of the Harper Analysis.
This could lead from the beginning to certain differences with the business environment.
The impact assessment shall apply in the case of large mergers and other contracts to decide whether consumers will suffer due to lack of competition.
It is called "effect assessment" because it takes into account not only the actions and intentions of the company but also the effect it will have on competition and the market.
The way in which this evaluation is drafted is extremely important for the outcome.
Harper's analysis of the competition law recommends a change in the impact assessment, which will make it harder for large companies to remove smaller operators from the market.
The government led by Tony Abbott was by the Australian Business Council and by the great retailers.
Turnbull now makes it clear that he wants the entire cabinet to think about what he'll do next.
The CAA has jumped to the point of saying that if Turnbull follows Harper's recommendations, consumers will need to pay higher prices.
It is ironic that the whole business environment is the one that advised the new Prime Minister to have greater respect for the cabinet processes, which Turnbull seems to do by letting Bruce Billson, the Minister for Small Business (which is on the side of Harper's recommendations) support his arguments in front of his colleagues.
Mediterranean diet could help prevent breast cancer
Spanish researchers have followed women between sixty and eighty years of age.
Those who eat mainly plants, fish and olive oil have reduced their chances of breast cancer.
Terrence Howard puts the multiplication table under the question mark
Terrence Howard is of the opinion that I fully understood arithmetic.
The negative person in the Empire said to Rolling Stone magazine that he doesn't think once he's equal to one.
"How can it be equal to one?" he said.
If once I do one, it means that two doesn't have value, because once it doesn't work.
Once I do two, because the square root of four is two, so what is the square root of two?
It should be one, but we're told it's two, and that's impossible.
Terrence, we don't really understand what you mean.
Not surprisingly, Howard's professors did not agree with his theory, so he resigned from Pratt Institute, where he studied chemical engineering.
"I mean you can't close your eyes when you know something's wrong in yourself," he explained.
Howard found the term "Terryology" for his parallel approach to mathematics.
The actor confesses that he spends his time cutting and reassembling perfumes, wires, magnets and plastics to illustrate his theory "once" and other similar theories of his.
He told the magazine that he and his ex-wife, Mira Pak, spent up to 17 hours a day creating these illustrations.
Editor Rolling Stone described Howard's creations as "carcasses with infinitely more complex, two-dimensional and three-dimensional shapes, linked to copper wire or magnets".
Howard says, among other things, that he hopes to receive the US patent 20150079872 A1 (“Systems and methods for improved construction sites”).
The actor in the "Following an Idol" also says that Pitagora Einstein and Tesla would "take her mad" if she saw Terryology.
"You know," he says, "I've been wondering since I was three or four years old why does a ball take shape around?"
Why doesn't he become a triangle or a square?
I understand why.
Howard added that he hoped to change the whole course.
"This will be the last century in which our children will learn that once they do one," he said.
They won't need to grow in ignorance anymore.
Twenty years from now, they'll know that once they do two.
We're about to reveal a new truth.
Real universal math.
We'll check it out in about 20 years.
Ariana Grande imitates Britney Spears at Wheel of Impression
On Tuesday, during the show "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon", Ariana Grande perfectly imitated Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.
The 22-year-old pop star sang little at Fallon's Wheel of Impression, playing "Mary Had a Little Lamb" as Spears, then displaying his vocal qualities with the song "The Wheels on the Bus" sung with the voice of Aguilera.
In turn, Fallon did a good job imitating Sting and Aaron Neville.
The two also interpreted versions of "I Can't Feel My Face" from The Weekend.
This week, Grande's name has always appeared in the press.
On the same day it was also at "Good Morning America", where it opened the show with the incident of the gogoache lens.
Taco Bell hopes that the "Cantina" restaurants where it will serve come to become urban points of interest
Would you like to spend an elegant evening in town?
Taco Bell is an option.
On September 22nd, the Mexican-style fast food restaurant chain will open a new location in the Wicker Park area of Chicago, offering a menu of tapas aperitif, a fresh one painted by a local artist and even alcoholic drinks.
It is the first test location of the Taco Bell Cantina restaurants in the chain, which addresses young people, concentrate in increasing numbers in the city centers.
Taco Bell, which has nearly 6000 restaurants in the United States, has its roots mainly in suburbs and is associated with cheap, fast-prepared food such as Doritos Locos Taco, extremely popular.
With an average Taco Bell payment note of USD 7, the company used drive-through services and fast services to attract the number of customers needed to make a profit.
But Taco Bell says that in order to address the new generation who "seek the most central urban environment in which to live, work and have fun", testing locations must follow a different model, with smaller spaces and more expensive options.
To make a drive-through, you need a field.
Can you imagine what it means to buy an acre of land in an area like Wicker Park?
"Don't allow it," said Today Neil Borkan, a Frenchman named Taco Bell, who will operate the location in Chicago.
At the location of Chicago, the new menu will be prepared along with traditional Taco Bell offers, in an open kitchen, where "you will see the food at your own expense" before being prepared, he told Associated Press Meredith Sandland, the head of development at Taco Bell.
The new location will also serve frozen wine, beer and alcoholic beverages, following the recent example of many of the Taco Bell competitors.
Now, seventy-five of the Starbucks cafes offer “nighttime” menus that include beer, wine and tastings.
A thousand of the approximately 1900 Chipotle restaurants offer alcoholic beverages.
The company said another location Taco Bell Cantina will open in San Francisco next to AT&T Park this month, replacing the drive-through service and parking with an interior court and a window for sale.
These changes in location, atmosphere and attachments indicate that the fast food restaurant chain wants to attract other types of customers outside those looking for fast food late at night.
Taco Bell decided for the first time on a higher quality cooking line in 2012, when he opened Cantina and more expensive burritos menus to compete with Chipote, the project was supported by an advertising campaign focused on the protein content of new preparations.
If they succeed, the Cantina restaurants will be another step towards a higher level.
Taco Bell said he intends to open 2000 restaurants in the United States by 2022.
As Sandland said for AP, "a few hundred" of them will be like "Cantina".
They kissed the phones in the middle of the night: Elton John makes Putin's court
Russian President Vladimir Putin phoned Elton John on Monday night only a few days after the British artist publicly said he wanted to meet the Russian politician to discuss the anti-gay legislation together.
The British gay singer, declaredly, tried unsuccessfully to get an interview with Putin while he was in Russia in November 2014, one year after challenging protests in this country and supporting two concerts in 2013, during a period of agitation in the state's history, after the adoption of controversial laws banning "gambling" in the minority.
In 2014, at St. Petersburg, the British artist criticised these laws and made the following statement in front of fans: "Although I'm gay, I always felt welcome here in Russia".
If I wasn't honest about what I am, I wouldn't be able to compose these songs.
They don't mean gay propaganda.
They represent the way I express my life.
If we start punishing people for that, then the world will lose humanity.
Last Saturday, the artist devalued that he wanted to meet with Putin to discuss this controversial issue.
So far, there is no clear information on the telephone discussion between the two personalities.
Cocos "song" all over the ANRP file
The businessman Dorin Cocos tried to save himself from a crippling sentence, "sing" all in front of the judges and detailing how he had given millions of euros to former members of the ANRP Commission.
Yesterday, heard at the High Court of Cassation and Justice in the case in which the son or Alin Cocos, the former head of DICOT Alina Bica and the former members of the Central Commission for the Establishment of the Disbursements in the framework of the ANRP, Dorin Cocos was struck as a spark of sincerity.
He acknowledged all the charges and told the judges how he helped businessman Gheorghe Stelian in the case of damages from the ANRP, in return asking him to be judged more quickly and to take into account his collaboration.
Thus, Cocos has shown that it has known Gheorghe Stelian since 2006 and that it has been engaged in this after several real estate transactions.
He stated that Sergiu Diacomatu met him in 2010, and he told him he was working at ANRP.
Later we found out that (Diacomatu, n.r.) is vice-president, and because Gheorghe Stelian had a file at ANRP, we asked him to help us.
I promised him two and a half million euros, the money I told him I'd give him in several tranches.
I also promised political support to remain in office.
"Diacomatu told me when he was helping me, but he needed support," Dorin Cocos said in the courtroom.
He said he later came into contact with Crinuta Dumitrean, who was then head of the Central Disbursement Commission, which promised him 800,000 euros.
For Gheorghe Stelian's second file, I knew he wanted over 300,000 euros.
Diacomatu already had political support, I gave him five million euros.
To Dumitrean's crinut a million euros, to Dragos Bogdan, I gave him 800,000 euros.
I'm just saying that all this money I gave him was in transit to make sure the file was solved.
"That's what I said: to fix the file, to pay off," said Cocos.
Asked why he had done these things, Dorin Cocos said he received eight million euros for the positive resolution of Gheorghe Stelian's second file.
I received, for the second file, eight million euros to solve the problem, but I only stayed with 1.2 million euros.
In 2013 we also met Alina Bica.
"I've never talked to this about money or land," Cocos said.
He further showed that "it was of note that all the members in the ANRP understood themselves before the sitting."
We didn't have the emotions that they wouldn't give a positive vote.
All the functions were political in ANRP, but I personally didn't help Diacomatu.
"I told him that I only helped him politically to calm him down," Cocos concluded his statement.
Ponta brings the European Court of Justice to the DNA
Prime Minister Victor Ponta was at the DNA yesterday, just five minutes ago, while he filed new documents in the file "Turceni - Rovinari".
Victor Ponta fled the DNA with a document from the European Court of Justice
Convinced that the case prosecutor will receive him for a discussion on the side of the file where he is being researched for fraud in private subscriptions, complicated tax evasion and money laundering, Victor Ponta went on his own initiative to DNA, although the documents he had could have been sent by the lawyer.
It wasn't like that, but the prosecutor didn't have time, the prime minister was leaving after five minutes, while he left more documents to register.
I wanted to file the European Court of Justice decision of 3 September, which explains what is happening to service contracts.
I say we've done business, the prosecutor says we haven't done, the European Court of Justice has told us to see each other's business, because, as long as the taxes were paid, it's okay.
"From the point of view of the European Court of Justice, which is mandatory, certainly, for all European Union countries, we do not have a case here," said Prime Minister Victor Ponta, at the time of DNA release.
The bridge further stated that, from a point of view, the decision of the European Court of Justice should apply if we are members of the EU.
Until then, the prime minister expects the prosecutor to read the decision of the European Court of Justice and call him back to the hearings, but also to give him a response to his requests, including the withdrawal of the file.
John sees his mandate without television
In Romania today, there is no legal provision to force you to watch TV.
And you don't even have such a device, since you pay your TV tax once with your bill to energy.
But if you're the head of state, things change radically.
Because, in practice, it is understood that the position of the President of Romania is also included in the list of day-to-day realities.
President Iohannis kneels daily in a total silence in the office or from Cotroceni
Only that, to the surprise of even the closest people to you from the Cotroceni Palace, Klaus Johannis refuses to have a TV in the presidential office.
And after you don't watch TV - on any program, not even on RTL or Pro Sieben - the president doesn't listen to radio stations or read newspapers.
Moreover, it does not even receive "negative monitoring" which, for example, the predecessor or a priority request.
Instead, Johannis is happy to receive only the report that puts him in a positive light.
And besides this informational self-insulation, in which the only break is access to the facebook, much more serious is the lockdown to which, by its passiveness, the head of the imposed state is all the activity of the Presidential Administration.
And that because, although it's been so bitter since its installation in office, Johannis hasn't signed more than half of the employees of the Presidential Administration's statements of loyalty yet.
Which becomes a more serious problem, both from a human and legal point of view.
Peacemakers and peacemakers
Those in the president's office are already clear that no one and nothing can wipe out the "feng shui" from the head of state.
Where there is peace and peace.
What's right, just after nine o'clock without a minute (no more, no less!), in the morning, when the former Sibi's edyl demands the presence of the officials.
A habit that probably didn't get rid of from the time he was running the city's headquarters in Cibin.
And about the fact that Johannis doesn't want television in the office, there are countless legends already born, being already people from the Cotroceni Palace who have come to turn to the version that the president would try to avoid monitoring it.
Especially that he doesn't have any radio.
Only that, at this rate, he's going to meditate as soon as in the dark, because lighting devices can also hide audio-video recording techniques.
Just fine.
Another strange thing from the Cotroceni Palace is the delivery to the head of state only of the president's "positive monitoring" activity.
I mean, if there's any good news about Klaus Johannis or his wife, the head of state will receive her continuance.
If not, no!
And more interesting is that "negative monitoring" was banned under conditions where, for example, Traian Basescu was recognized not only as a result of the night-time broadcasts on the television in which he was criticized, but he called every morning, with priority, negative news.
That doesn't mean mice have helped him something, but that's what the gesture counts!
And at least he can never have an excuse that he wasn't well informed from alternative sources.
Not outside, not confirmed
Now, until the end of the day, the mystery why he doesn't want to look at Klaus Johannis on TV.
Until then, however, it would be more important to resolve, whatever the formula, the contractual situation of hundreds of employees from the presidential administration.
Which, in order to be able to work here, are obliged to sign a declaration of loyalty to the head of state in charge and who must bear its signature.
Only that, since December and so far, Klaus Johannis has not signed for confirmation at least half of these statements, although this had to happen within 30 days.
So hundreds of employees, representing more than half the staff at the Cotroceni Palace, have an uncertain situation now.
Because, legally speaking, if the head of state doesn't personally sign the statement, they should be out.
Only that all of them didn't get a negative opinion!
So, in a sense, I can come to the inspectors of the Court of Auditors, who will find that, over half a year, hundreds of people have received their salaries at least somewhere on the legal side.
This until the president decides whether to remove or confirm his position, his decision is strict.
Authorities have stated that a teenager launched an attack on Pope Francis during his visit to the United States
The ISIS-inspired plan of a teenager to attack Pope Francis during his visit to the United States was rather "in aspiratory" than operational, confirmed a police source for Fox News on Tuesday.
The 15-year-old boy was arrested in the Philadelphia area in August when law enforcement authorities filed the plan.
The plan is the same as that mentioned by Texas Representative Mike McCaul, President of Internal Security during an interview on Sunday, said a source for Fox News.
"We monitor very closely the threats against the Pope for his visit to the United States of America," McCaul at "This Week" from ABC said.
Pope Francis was not mentioned as the specific target of the plan in a bulletin.
Joint information from the FBI and the Department of Internal Security of 14 August, which states that the adolescent was planning to use more attackers, firearms and explosives, with the aim of "a foreign dignitary during a high-level event".
The Bulletin states that the minority has radicalised through social networks.
It is possible that the adolescent suffers from a mental illness, said a source of law enforcement authority for Fox News, but without giving exact details about the young man’s disease.
Also on Sunday, McCaul recognized the potential for an attack by a so-called "one-stop-shop" at the level of the entire nation and mentioned that he was informed by the Secret Services regarding a "strictly secret location" for the visit of the Pope.
And with this comes a great security risk... but as the time approaches, I think we'll all be very vigilant and protect him when he gets to the United States.
Matt Dean from Fox News made this material.
The skeleton dating from the medieval period discovered in the tree suffered a violent death, experts say
Irish archaeologists have revealed fascinating details about the strange skeleton dating from the medieval period, found at the root of a 215-year-old tree.
Colloney's Faulk, Sligo, fell during a storm this year, taking out the macabre look of a skeleton caught between its roots.
The Irish National Monuments Service brought experts from the Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services to excavate and analyse the remains, thus discovering an exciting story.
"He was murdered violently," said Marion Dowd, director of the Sligo-Leitrim Archaeological Services, for FoxNews.com.
On the top of his chest he has knife wounds. He still has one in his left hand, which suggests he's trying to defend himself.
The skeleton is a young man between the ages of 17 and 20.
Radiocarbon analysis shows that residues are between 900 and 1000 years old.
"We cannot tell if he was killed in a fight or in a personal dispute," says Dowd, noting that the body was buried after a Christian ritual, with his head headed west.
"Probably buried by family or community," she added.
Dowd said for FoxNews.com who planted the tree didn't know about the grave.
"It was just a coincidence, the context is an unusual one," she said.
There are historical documents attesting that there was a church and a cemetery in the area, but today there are no visible traces of them.
There is another unusual aspect of the discovery: the height of the young man.
"He had 1 meter 77," says Dowd.
For the early medieval society, that means a lot.
The federal government spends $1.5 million to study what babies think about food
The National Institutes for Health (NIH) spent almost $1.5 million studying what young children think about food.
The project, called "The Way I Feel Babys and Little Children Food" is being carried out by the University of Chicago and has so far established that small people are not prepared to eat lentil foods by other people or by other people.
According to the project's financier, "adequate nutrition is important for health and longevity, but many Americans do not have nutritionally healthy diets".
There is evidence to suggest that the first diet models of infants and young children have lasting consequences for the health of their whole life.
The prerequisite for this study is that there is no research on how babies are fed.
“Despite the complexity and significance of the food selection, psychologists for the development of the child have been a little surprised to learn how babies and young children perceive, learn and understand food, the financier said.
The current proposal applies methods of cognitive development to test social impacts on the choice and consumption of food in infants and young children.
Researchers say about babies that they have "limited knowledge in the food sector".
Children between three and six years of age "know more about food than babies and young children", but they are "extremely mofturous consumers".
An actress who played "Star Trek: Voyager" is accused of indecent exposure in Tennessee
An actress who played in the TV series "Star Trek: Voyager" was arrested in the east of Tennessee, being accused of being exposed to children.
Several media channels report that Jennifer Ann Lien, a 41-year-old actress who played Kes' role in the television series, is charged with two indecent exposure offences involving children under 13 years of age, according to the arrest report.
The officers of the sheriff's office in Roane County brought the arrest warrant on September 3rd to Lien's home in Harriman, where they said they found an empty one under a roof on the couch.
Officers said Lien refused their requests for clothes.
The chief of police in Harriman, Randy Heidle, says that Lien was charged with several counts, including that of worse physical damage after the April incident in which Lien entered a police car with a personal car.
He still doesn't know if he's a lawyer.
Police identified the murder victim found in the Epping forest
A man whose body was decomposed was discovered in a tourist forest was identified.
On 9 September, Hidir Aksakal, 53 years old, was found near Hollow Ponds in the Epping forest in northeast London.
The man of Turkish origin lived in Margate, Kent, and had close links to the Green Lanes area in Haringey, north of London.
Last time he was seen in Green Lanes in the morning of Monday, August 17.
A postmortem analysis proved he was killed, and the detectives say his body was probably in the Epping forest for weeks.
Inspector General Jamie Piscopo of the Metropolitan Police said: “Mr. Aksakal was very well-known at the local level as Boxer Cetin and we hope to find information from the Green Lanes community that will help us investigate.
Hollow Ponds is an extensive and popular tourist destination, where there is a café and a lake for boat walks.
It is also surrounded by streets with heavy traffic.
We are asking all those who have been in the area in recent weeks and may have observed some unusual activity or suspected to come and talk to us.
Super Chief: Six Women Jail Between Maternity and Service
Unlike any other country in the world, with the exception of Papua New Guinea, in the United States of America there is no centralized policy on the maternity leave paid.
Two weeks ago, when the Executive Director of Yahoo, Marissa Mayer, announced that she was pregnant with twins, but was going to take a very short maternity leave and work in her spare time, the 40-year-old woman was widely criticized for encouraging a culture that awaits the superwoman or nothing.
But Mayer, she herself a symbol of the top woman, is guilty of unrealistic expectations?
How do other women's leaders handle it?
Seema Patel, a lawyer and deputy director of the Office for the Application of Labour Standards in San Francisco, just got a job in the government in Washington DC a few years ago, when her boss surprised her with an unexpected advice.
"I don't know anything about you," her boss told her.
But if you're going to make a family for the future, get yourself a break from now on.
Patel's employer was the federal government, and she didn't even get a maternity leave paid as part of her contract of employment.
At that time, Patel was single and very focused on her career, and the family was the last thing she thought about.
But he listened to her boss' advice.
She avoided using her medical leave days for four years, so when she became pregnant with her first child, two years ago, she was confined to three months of paid leave.
Six months ago, when the second child was born, Patel was no longer able to implement the same strategy.
The four months of leave he took were entirely unpaid.
Patel says she didn't feel any rejection from her colleagues, but she has a problem with the structure of work.
"I find it very discouraging for anyone trying to have a family," she says.
Send a message: Your country does not value you as a parent.
Karen Choi, Vice-President of the Capital Group asset management firm, says that any employed woman who is also a mother should be commended.
Choi, who has four children, one of whom is a six-month-old baby, describes the juggle between the quality of her mother and her job as "a constant battle".
The secret to not sneezing is having "an incredible family with you" and a bona fide and a babysitter, to accept that there are things that will not be the best (“not everyone can be Martha at home”) and just go through it.
Choi says she took an ever-increasing maternity leave for each child, starting from two months and half for the first and ending with six months for the last.
That makes her an exception, especially in her field of activity.
When your child is sick, he has fever, vomiting, and you stay up all night to take care of him, and you know that next morning you have to take the other kids to school, then go to work...
Then it becomes very complicated," she says.
However, her company supported it and noted that the performance of her investment portfolio was not suffering at all.
When she went into the finance industry after college, about 20 of her college colleagues chose the same way, she said.
Today, about 90% of them have given up.
The women who quit their job, then start again have the same chances at top paid well, she says.
It's hard to stay: "In the short term it's a sacrifice, but in the long term the results are seen."
Anyway, her children helped her make sense of this sacrifice, because all four of her children are girls.
One of the things that helps me move on is that I'd like to be a model for them.
The idea of being an example for her four children is what motivates the scientist and Professor Kelly Posner, aged 48.
Children know that their mother is helping to save human lives.
Posner, founder and director of the Centre for the Evaluation of the Risk of Suicide at Columbia University, says it is important for women to know that they can have a "great goal" in terms of career and to fulfill it.
It's very important for women to think they can have a vision.
Most people can't believe this," she says.
He once made a presentation in front of 200 people, including government officials, in Italy during a web site, when she was pregnant in eight months.
She also helped technology, she says, because she can stop the car and answer the phone after she takes the children or answers an e-mail from the walk.
The bond between motherhood and an applicant career has been helped by an optimistic personality, inclined to solve problems, she says. The ability to bring things to a successful end even when this seems impossible.
Jennifer Epps-Addison, 33 years old, the executive director of Wisconsin Jobs Now and the mother of two children, says that making motherhood and career work together only through private help networks, such as bonds, is wrong.
"You should not be lucky or win the lottery to succeed," she says, describing the failure of the system to support women and families - mentioning very small salaries, the poor health system and the lack of a paid maternity leave.
"As a society, we don't care about each other," she says.
We can't even guarantee the recovery of mothers just born.
Epps-Addison, who was pregnant while attending law school, gave birth to her baby while she was receiving the scholarship.
With a husband and a child based on the medical assistance provided by the scholarship, the labor leader was able to take a maternity leave of just two weeks, then return to work.
Lisa Mosko, a fashionist and mother of two children, says that fewer and fewer women will abandon their profession if they benefit more from social support, in the form of day care services from companies, maintaining programs established by common agreement and accepting that effective work does not mean staying over the program.
In the face of the constraints of logistic order, says Mosko, there is the additional pressure to activate in an area where being a mother is sometimes synonymous with the epitome of lack of taste (“mommy dress” is one of the most serious insults).
"The image is part of our job - it lifts you up or pulls you down," she explains.
Moscow's "permanent negotiation" for its multiple roles to function harmoniously means to keep its appearance and a beautiful bag in its hand, from which to sometimes fall a toy-two.
If he remembers that men are also fathers, society could allow women to do more.
People don't judge men that they're not good fathers to the extent that they judge women who are mothers.
Shola Olatoye, president and executive director of the New York Housing Authority, who deals with the homes of over 400,000 New Yorkers and has over 11,000 employees, says motherhood and career does not mean talking about "balance".
The notion of balance is a bit inappropriate.
It's more like a balance sheet," she says.
The mother of three children, one of whom has only three months, just took a maternity leave seven weeks after she was born this year.
"It was a very important period for the agency," she explains.
She knew that seven weeks would not be enough, but her husband managed to get her paternity leave, and she managed to have a flexible program, which means to leave early or late, so that she could breast-feed her child.
Olatoye, who runs with her friends every morning that ends at 06:00 (“ cheaper than therapy”) is still breast-feeding.
At the service, he tried to create an environment "friendly to parents", in which the delay due to a child is allowed, and the response to e-mails should not be sent unannounced from the office.
"The concept and the notion of family has changed and changed very much," Olatoye says.
"The family is very different from what it was 25 or even 10 years ago."
The job is the one that needs to be adapted.
Russian humorists say they cheated Elton John on a call from Putin
For cynics it seemed too nice to be true: a phone call from Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, to Sir Elton John, the singer and activist for the rights of sexual minorities, in which to discuss the rights of homosexuals.
Unfortunately for John, it was not true: despite an exuberant post on Instagram in which the Russian leader's appreciation for addressing him on the issue immediately became clear that anyone who would have called him on Monday night would certainly not have been Putin.
The Kremlin had already said he didn't know about that conversation.
And on Wednesday, two famous Russian humorists admitted that they, not the president, were foreign voices at the other end of the conversation.
"We thought it was unlikely that Putin would want to meet with him or call him, or at least not too soon," Vladimir "Vovan" Krasnov, who imitated Putin, said while his colleague, Alexei "Lexus" Stoliarov, became president's spokesman, Dmitri Peskov.
"Then it seems Elton John was really waiting for this phone, so he immediately thought that it was really a conversation with the right people we were giving," he told Komsomolskaya Pravda.
He said, "Thank you, it was the surprise of the day."
This day and this conversation were the most wonderful and most enjoyable of my life.
In order to complete John's plight, the two announced that they would publish a recording of the conversation on a popular Russian night show.
John's representatives did not make statements about the farce speculation.
The story is based on comments made by the singer during the weekend, in which Putin criticised Putin for his attitude to homosexuals while the LGBT rights army in Kiev, particularly a Russian law adopted in 2013, banning the spread of "propaganda for non-traditional sexual relations" among minors.
"I would like to meet [ Putin], let's talk," John told the BBC, saying that, although the idea was "probably unrealistic", it still deserves an attempt.
Then, Monday evening, the singer expressed disbelief to some observers when she posted a message on a social network, saying Putin answered his critics by taking the phone and calling him.
He said he "waits eagerly to meet [the president] in front of him to discuss the equality of LGBT in Russia".
Unfortunately for John, Putin was not the one at the end of the other line, but Stoliarov and Krasnov, known for phone records of many Russian and Ukrainian celebrities and politicians.
Stoliarov, who speaks well English, played Peskov's role and claimed to be the interpreter of the two.
When asked about the possibility of a conversation, true Peskov told reporters Tuesday that Putin would be "ready to meet Elton John and answer all his questions", but that no such request was received from the singer at Kremlin.
The Kremlin had reason to question the authenticity of the post from Instagram, he added, "especially because it is not written in full in correct English".
We don't think Sir Elton John would have written as well as grammar mistakes.
Even before the Russian duet declared its public light, local media channels were already suspected of John being the victim of a joke.
Some users in the online environment identify Krasnov as guilty, known for the farce made to the politicians with the phones they record and post on his YouTube channel as Vovan222.
Phone calls in a joke to public people, then publishing registrations have become a real phenomenon in Russia in recent years.
Stoliarov, who is considered by many as the initiator of the genre, has developed his talent to make the farce of Ukrainian politicians.
He was interviewed on the phone on Ukrainian television, imitating Anton Geraşchenko, the direct adviser to the Interior Minister Arsen Avakov.
He imitated Geraşchenko so well that last year he spoke to former Dnipropetrovsk governor Ihor Kolomoski, better than six hours in several days.
Krasnov became known after the 2011 parliamentary elections, which led to massive street protests following massive fraud reports.
As Arkadi Dvorkovich, the councillor of then President Dmitri Medvedev, convinced the president of the electoral committee, Vladimir Churov, that Medvedev intended to fire him.
In addition to numerous Russian celebrities, among his victims were former President of the USSR Mihail Gorbachev, chief of Kiev and champion of Vitali Klitschko and Russian Sports Minister Vitali Mutko, who tricked him into apologizing for the behavior of his athletes.
Last year, Krasnov would have called Belarus President Aleksandr Lukaşenko, becoming the son of the retired Ukrainian leader, Viktor Ianukovic.
It was so convincing that the person from the other end, whose voice looked like Lukasenko, offered him asylum.
John's initial statement that he would like to discuss with Putin caused a huge reaction in Russia.
Lawyer Vitali Milonov of St. Petersburg, who contributed to the law on "propaganda", told The Guardian that John should not bother Putin with a "so important subject" and was ready to meet him with the singer to explain Russia's position.
The Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper opened an online survey for readers, where 39% of respondents felt that Putin and John should meet, and 22% thought that such a meeting would damage Putin's reputation.
A new study shows that more people die from air pollution than malaria and HIV/AIDS
According to a new reference study, more than 3 million people a year die prematurely from outdoor air pollution, more than malaria and HIV/AIDS together.
The main cause, particularly in Asia, is wood and coal burning for housing heating and cooking, but research reveals that an equally alarming reason is agricultural emissions in Europe and the US, where they are the main cause of these deaths.
The report warns that if measures are not taken, the number of deaths - already equivalent to six deaths per minute - will double by 2050.
"These projections should signal an alarm to public health agencies around the world," said Professor Michael Jerrett, an environmental expert at the University of California, who was not involved in research.
Most of the deaths caused by air rain are caused by tiny particles, which can be inhaled deep into the lungs.
They cause heart attack and stroke, which are responsible for three quarters of the 3.3 million deaths a year, while the rest are caused by lung cancer and respiratory diseases.
The research did not include the effects of indoor air pollution, for example from cooking fires, which are estimated to cause another 3.4 million deaths per year.
The new study, published in the Nature newspaper, is the first to highlight various sources of outdoor air pollution and estimated the number of premature deaths caused by them, taking into account road traffic, fossil fuel-based plants and other sources.
Researchers have used a detailed computerized model of the global atmosphere to assess the impact of air pollution on the various populations, including new information on how pollution affects the people of China and India.
One third of all premature deaths were the result of the use of smoke-extinguishing fuels, such as wood and coal, for the heating of dwellings or cooked, and the use of dirty diesel generators for electricity, all being recognized dangers.
This domestic energy consumption accounts for half of India’s 645,000 annual deaths and one third of China’s 1.4 million annual deaths.
However, research has found that ammonia agricultural emissions have had a "remarkable" impact, according to Professor Jos Lelieveld of the Max Planck Chemical Institute in Germany, which conducted the research.
A fifth of deaths at the global level are caused by these emissions, mainly from wheat, birds and pigs and from excessive use of fertilisers.
Ammonia reacts with exhaust gases from traffic and industry and produces tiny particles, the main cause of the deaths due to air pollution in the US, Japan and Europe.
"For London, agriculture is the main source," says Lelieveld.
Throughout the United Kingdom, 48% of the premature deaths were the result of agricultural pollution.
Traffic pollution is still an important factor in developed countries, causing one fifth of the deaths, despite measures against polluting vehicles.
This has caused only 5% of deaths at global level, but the number could increase as more and more cars appear on the streets in developing countries.
Central air pollution, in particular coal-operated ones, has been significant at global level, causing one of seven deaths.
In the United States it is the main single factor, causing one third of the 55,000 deaths annually, compared with 16% in the United Kingdom.
Natural air pollution, especially in arid and dusty regions, has caused nearly one fifth of the deaths at the global level caused by air pollution.
This source is a major factor in some arid countries, responsible for 92% of the deaths in Egypt and 81% in Iran.
"The addition between the high pollution rate and the large number of inhabitants is saying the word about public health, but there is nothing more known about the sources of pollution responsible for premature deaths," Jerrett says.
The results are surprising and important for the protection of public health at the global level.
It is now assumed that all particles are as toxic.
However, if the fuel burning causes are more toxic, as some scientists suspect, the percentage of premature deaths that can be attributed to agricultural emissions would be lower.
Even so, says Jerrett, "the discovery is very valuable... because agriculture has not generally been seen as a major source of air pollution or premature death and because it suggests that much more attention should be given to agricultural sources, both by scientists and political leaders."
Dr. Oliver Wild, an atmospheric specialist at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom, said: “The study itself underlines the need to control air quality, in order to avoid these deaths, especially in very populated areas of Asia.”
A statement by Victor Ponta tensions and more relations with Hungary
Budapest asks Ponta to stop lying, the Roman Prime Minister speaks of attitudes that bring to mind Nazism
Relations with Hungary, already tense after the announcement of building a border guard with Romania, after the Serbian border, have experienced a new degradation following statements made by Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who accused the authorities in Budapest of treating refugees "with beating and incarceration".
Hungary's diplomacy reacted strongly by talking about "extreme and false" claims, but Victor Ponta did not give up any more and accused government officials in the neighbouring country of being "a shame" for Europe.
Noted that it's not for the first time when Ponta is trying to tension Romano-Onging relations by statements made at delicate times or with an electoral character.
It all started with a statement made Monday by Victor Ponta, in which he tried to argue that Romania cannot receive more than 1,800 refugees.
Your problem with our logistical ability to treat those people like some people, not like our Hungarian neighbors, with bats and inscriptions.
I don't agree with that.
Mr. Basescu put himself in the forefront of an ugly and horrible feeling that exists in all societies, namely a feeling of xenophobic.
It's very good to have a debate, but it's our job to solve the problem.
"We will treat those people as we do," said Victor Ponta, quoted by Truth, Monday.
It is not clear what Victor Ponta was talking about when he spoke about the integration of refugees, but Cehia was recently in the centre of criticism after writing numbers on the hands of migrants on several trains, in a gesture that recalled the procedure used by the Nazis to identify Jewish prisoners from the concentration camps.
Peter Szijjarto appreciated, according to the Hungarian MTI news agency, taken over by Magyaridok.hu, that the internal political crises that have shaken Victor Ponta's position make him make the statements "extremist and false".
The Romanian businessman from Budapest was summoned to provide the explanations, Mediafax reports, quoting MTI.
"Mr. Victor Ponta has recently made inappropriate statements about how Hungary manages the immigrant crisis," the Hungarian Foreign Ministry states.
Levente Magyar, Secretary of State for Foreign Trade and Foreign Affairs in the Hungarian EMI, expressed the "surprising" in connection with "Victor Ponta's constant attempts to save his moral position by anti-regulating lies", underlines Budapest's diplomacy.
"I don't want to respond to the challenges that came from some Hungarian government representatives - but read the report below and you will understand the indignation that I feel, as a European man and citizen, the face of the attitudes and attitudes that Europe saw only in the 1930s!"," wrote Ponta, on his Facebook account.
He argues that, like other European politicians, he has the "duty" to draw attention to and sanction the "constant behaviour of high-level government officials in Hungary" who are "a shame to the culture and values of the European Union" by "anti-Semitic attitudes", "treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now in the refugee crisis!"
"The gimped scarcity, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, political decisions are nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which those refugees fled!", accused Ponta, claiming that he believes in "solidarity, rational and sustainable solutions, and above all European values", and "what we see in the last days in Hungary is in total contradiction to these goals and values!"
During the series, Ponta was invited to Antena 3, where the main subject was Hungary.
If Mihai Gadea called Viktor Orban the black sheep of Europe, a dictator, Ponta wondered what would happen if the Georgian military took and shot or killed some children or women, in a speech in which he made several references to Nazism.
In the dispute, UDMR president Kelemen Hunor also intervened, who considered that the Roman authorities should not have a "sensitivity approach" regarding Hungary's intention to build a border guard.
UDMR leader claims that this solution must be understood not to be directed against Romania or the Roman citizens, he claims that the guard might even help our country not to become an intense route to migration by migrants who will reach the Schengen area, according to Agerpres.
First of all, I want to stress, say, that we do not have to marry, take this whole thing as something against Romania, and don't have to use it to make relationships worse anyway, not too good between the two governments, because it's not the case.
I think any sentimental, visceral approach is wrong.
"We need to see the rationale, see why we have arrived here and we need to know and say this, that it is not against us, it is not against Romania, Roman citizens and it does not impede free movement between the two states within the EU," Kelemen Hunor said.
The news ignored in 2012 Russia's offer to infiltrate Bashar al-Assad from Syria's leadership
Russia has now proposed more than three years ago the intrusion of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as part of a peace agreement, according to an official high stake involved at that time in the negotiations with the doors closed between the western states and the Russian Federation, writes The Guardian.
Finland's former president and Nobel Peace Prize winner Martti Ahtisaari said the Western powers have not benefited from the proposal since.
Since 2012, tens of thousands of people have died and millions more have had to flee the country, giving birth to the most serious refugee crisis since the end of World War II.
Ahtisaari interviewed the representatives of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (USA, the United Kingdom, France, the Russian Federation, and China) in February 2012.
It further stated that during the discussions, the Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churchin offered a plan that included among others and the proposal addressed to Assad to give up power at a given time after the start of the peace negotiations between the regime and the opposition.
It proposed three things:
One--we don't have to arm the opposition.
Two - we need to start a dialogue between Assad and the opposition immediately.
"Three - we have to look for an elegant way to withdraw from Assad," Ahtisaari said, reporting the position of the Russian ambassador.
However, he said Ahtisaari, the United States, Britain and France were so convinced that the Syrian dictator was about to fall, that they ignored the Russian ambassador's proposal.
"It was a missed opportunity in 2012," Finland's former president continued.
Russia has officially firmly supported Bashar al-Assad throughout the four-and-a-half years of war, insisting that its intruder cannot represent a proposal in any peace agreement.
Assad thinks Russia will never abandon him.
Moscow has recently begun sending troops, tanks and military aircraft to Syria, in an effort to stabilize Assad's regime and to confront the extremists of the Islamic State.
Antenna 3 live programme will be available at cost
Antenna 3 informed its viewers on Tuesday that from 1 November the program or live will be available online at cost on the basis of a monthly subscription.
In a "telespector writing", the Intact Trust news post states that "we are doing this with a strange heart, wanting to stay with us at this new stage, imposed by market conditions".
According to the same message, the subscription will be 1 euro per month "for those of you who follow us online", promising that the TV will be of very good quality.
Antenna 3 argues that "all these live broadcasts from the country and abroad, campaigns, day-to-day news have been and are possible through a constant, assumed financial effort, which has assumed a permanent retnology and focus on quality".
We managed to support ourselves, under conditions where offline and online distributors have contributed nothing for the content offered.
The announcement comes under conditions where the news television program is accessible on the basis of subscription and online Antena Play platform, where otherwise the most frequently exclusive and recording of Antena's broadcasts were accessible.
Reports show that animal populations and marine plants have been halved in the last 40 years
The scale of the crisis facing marine animals and plants is documented in detail in a study that states that marine species from all over the world, including those essential for human food security, are in a decline that can be catastrophic.
Unprecedented pressures from several directions at the global ocean ecosystem level combine and create a wave of difficulties for almost all marine survivors, says the report "the living blue planet" of the WWF.
Coral reefs are subjected to serious declination risks (WWF) Some marine habitats, such as mangroves and seaweed, which depend on many other species, have recorded a significant decline, while entire fish populations with commercial value, such as macro and tuna, have decreased vertigino with three quarters by the 1970s, the report shows.
Many coral reefs, usually described as tropical forests of the oceans because of their huge biodiversity, could be threatened with extinction by the middle of this century if ocean acidity continues to deteriorate as a result of increased levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, causing a directly proportional increase in the level of carbonic acid in the sea.
"Healthy seas are an extraordinary source of beauty and natural wonder and are also a basis for the functioning of the global economy," said Louise Heaps, chief marine policy adviser at WWF-UK, who contributed to the report's conclusion.
"By overfishing, damaging coastal habitats, and without solving the global warming problem, we are sowing seeds of an ecological economic disaster," says Dr. Heaps.
The report, based on a review of the scientific literature published, but also on the Indices of the Living Planet, a database maintained by the Zoological Society of London, is one of the most detailed studies on marine life ever undertaken.
Almost 20% of the total mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005 (WWF) It researched a wide variety of marine species, from fish, sea turtles and sea turtles - a worm-like animal with warm skin - to marine plants such as mangroves and algae.
The report found that algae have decreased by approximately 30% in the last century, while total mangrove areas have decreased by 20% between 1980 and 2005, mainly as a result of bed fishing and other forms of aquaculture.
During a single generation, human activity has caused huge damage to the ocean, catching fish faster than it can reproduce and also destroying their banks.
Deep changes are needed to ensure an abundant ocean life in the next generations," said Marco Lambertini, Director General of WWF International.
Some of the most dramatic declines have been recorded in fish species for commercial profits.
For example, 58 populations of 17 species belonging to the Schrombidae family - macrou, tuna and sardines - have decreased by 74% between 1970 and 2010, without any signs of recovery, says the report.
We are in a race of fishing that could end with people being deprived of a vital source of food and an essential economic engine.
Overfishing, the destruction of marine habitats and climate change have serious consequences for the entire human population, and the poor communities, based on the sea, will be hit as quickly and as strongly as possible," Lambertini said.
"The collapse of ocean ecosystems could trigger a serious economic downturn and could undermine our fight to eradicate poverty and malnutrition," he continued.
Professor Ken Norris, ZL’s scientific director, said: “These alarming figures show how fast they change plants and animals in the oceans and are a clear warning of the problems we could face as a result.”
Sea grass: deep seaweed, which captures the rich sediments in minerals and stabilizes the bottom of the sea.
Over the last century, the cover area has decreased by 30%.
Mangrove: their existence is known in 123 countries, almost half of the total area representing only five countries.
Nearly 20% of the total mangrove areas disappeared between 1980 and 2005, mainly because of human invasion.
Coral reefs: some of the richest and most productive habitats on earth.
A quarter of all marine species live in coral reefs or near them, but three quarters of them are currently threatened and many may disappear during this century if the acidity of the ocean continues to deteriorate.
Deep-sea habitats: very little is known about the deepest areas of the ocean, but the decline in fish catches in these inaccessible locations over the last 40 years suggests that they are also affected by marine changes at global level.
Steven Gerrard denies the charges of racism that would have been brought to him by his former teammate at Liverpool, El-Hadji Diouf
In a passage from his autobiography at "My Story", serialized by Daily Mail, Gerrard criticizes the Senegalese player saying that "he is not really interested in football" and that he is the colleague who liked "the least" in the 17 years spent at the club.
In response, Diouf would have responded to the Senegalese radio station Groupe Futurs Medias, with cited sentences attributed to the attacker, who would have said that "Gerrard never liked the people of color".
Gerrard's lawyers denied any charges of racism brought against him.
In his most recent book, Gerrard, who made himself public even before his bad opinion about Diouf, criticised the attitude and degree of professionalism of his former colleague.
"I don't want to waste my time thinking about El Hadji Diouf, but I have to mention his ironic seasons at Liverpool as an example of how things can go backwards," he writes.
"It seems to me that Diouf is not really interested in football and that he does not care at all about Liverpool," he continued.
For example, the way he spit a huge and viscous flag into a Celtic fan in a Uefa Cup game from Parkhead in March 2003 is proof of his contemptuous and rancourous behavior.
Diouf turned out to be a controversial figure all the time that was spent on Anfield, his most famous night being Celtic Park.
The former Senegalese was interrogated by the police after the spitting episode and amended with the counter-value of his salary for two weeks at the club, the amount of 60,000 pounds being given to a humanitarian organisation at the election of Celtic.
In his previous autobiography, published in 2007, Gerrard describes Diouf as lazy and selfish.
"His attitude was completely wrong," Gerrard then wrote.
I didn't feel that he was just willing to make every effort to help Liverpool get back to the top.
Diouf, who is now playing at the Malaysian Sabah club, criticised Gerrard in public and attacked Gerrard's old friend and teammate Jamie Carragher.
In 2012, Diouf named Gerrard "egoist" and claimed that no one from Anfield likes the player who led the team to win the Championships League in 2005.
Diouf is also quoted as saying that Gerrard is "jelos".
He said: “Gerrard is just jealous of me.
He didn't touch the results I had in football.
When I came to Liverpool, I came with the Chief's status, and he lives there.
I am respected in the world of football, the greatest experts in football have framed me among the first seven players at the World Championship and among the first 100 players of the century.
Many big players don't have a feeling of belonging.
Wherever I go in other countries, I'm revered, while Gerrard is killed every time he leaves his hometown Liverpool.
From the hero to the professional dancer: Alek Scarlatos' fast path to "Dancing With the Stars"
In this season of "Dancing With the Stars", Alek Scarlatos not only plays the role of hero in uniform.
It is also a young, attractive and athletic guy, equally discreet and modern, say producers.
"There are many categories and we are always looking for the most popular moment," said Deena Katz, the executive co-producer of the ABC show.
I swear he'll find his prints after that.
It's beautiful.
He's got something special.
Before he competed in the famous show - but only a few weeks before - Scarlatos arrived in the international press after he had taken an attitude to a major danger.
He and the two friends from his childhood, Spencer Stone and Anthony Sadler, have housed a man armed with an AK-47 in a train full of travelers who were going from Amsterdam to Paris.
The three have stopped what could have been a mass murder by a potential terrorist.
After that, 22-year-old Skarlatos, a senator in the National Army, who grew up near Sacramento, received a phone call from President Obama, a message on Twitter from Donald Trump and a dinner with Arnold Schwarzenegger and was decorated by the American army and the French government.
Although a few local assessments may have been anticipated - on Friday, at Sacramento, there was a parade in the youth's honor - there was not expected to be so many positive reactions or the invitation to participate in "Dancing With the Stars".
"Not in a million years would I have thought that I would receive this offer," Skarlatos confessed on Saturday, in a break from the dance repetitions with his partner, Lindsay Arnold.
Everything seems new and crazy to me.
Even though before the show last month he recognized that he was "lightly excited", he did it as a professional at his first Foxtrot, getting points that brought him almost to the front of the competition.
Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tonoli and Julianne Hough, who formed the jury, said they offered one of the best performances in the series.
Katz and the executive producer from "DWTS" Rob Wade said they wanted to keep a free place in the show for the last hundred meters invited competitors, as is the case of Scarlatos, who grew up in the public eye.
In this case, Katz heard about the three American friends on vacation who dropped a gun attack on a 500 passenger train and immediately thought about inviting one of them to the dance competition.
He searched the social networks, found family members and sent messages to Scarlatos.
When he appeared at "Good Morning America" to tell the incident during which Stone and other passengers were injured, Katz worked with the ABC watch programme to avoid going through all media bars.
He supported the "five-minute plea", then waited patiently to find out if Scarlatos would agree to participate in the "DWTS".
"For a while everything was very uncertain, because this is so different why he does," Katz confessed.
A little while ago, he was fighting in Afghanistan, and now we're asking him if he's got a dance boss.
Scarlatos, who is in a short vacation from the National Guard, didn't even see a whole show until recently.
He hesitated to participate, mainly because he didn't want to be alone.
The show couldn't invite all three friends.
But the producers had an ace in their hand: Noah Galloway, a war veteran, with their hands and feet amputated.
They encouraged Scarlatos to call Galloway, the favorite fan and finalist of the past season, and ask him about his experience.
That was probably the critical point, in addition to Katz's continuous "hunting" and "incessant messages," she said.
"Noah is a wonderful guy and I wanted to know how the army will be seen and how the image of my friends will be protected," Scarlatos said.
He told me I should go.
So, after that conversation, I accepted.
Scarlatos, a great sports and history lover, never danced until then, and Arnold confessed in interviews that he was trying to make him relax again and give up his military position rather rigidly.
But Katz says it is confident that it will adapt and that viewers will react positively.
He'll get a lot of love from the beginning, because people are proud of him and what he's done.
"How can you not support him?" Katz said.
But that'll only take a few weeks.
To go further, you have to dance.
Scarlatos, who is a fool and wants to become a cop, says that, so far, he has had fun in this completely unknown environment.
The program was the hardest fight, and it was necessary to travel frequently to Los Angeles between the times when it was celebrated in the media and the various premiere ceremonies.
He said that at the end of August, when he returned to the United States immediately after the train incident, he just wanted to relax with his family.
"This lasted about a day and a half," he said.
In total, I stayed at home for four days.
There is a risk of reaching a person who attracts media attention, but is not used to being in the light of reflectors, executive producer Wade said.
And the show wants to make sure that the competitor manages and has fun.
"The pressure is high and we want participants to have a pleasant experience," Wade said.
"I don't want Alex to ever say, "Aoleu, what did I get into?"
Let's keep his fists to have fun.
McRib from McDonald's coming back.
The time has come for those waiting all year long for the pork sandwich in the form of mini-coasts to enjoy.
But is it harder to find this year?
CNBC reports that only 55% of the country's McDonald's franciselles offer this season specialty.
Last year, 75% of the restaurants served McRib sandwich.
"Approximately 8000 restaurants participate in McRib's 2015 promotion," McDonald's spokesman Lisa McComb said in an e-mail for The Times.
In the United States there are just over 14 300 fast-food restaurants.
But according to McComb, individual French owners decide whether or not to serve McRib.
"Participation is not significantly different from last year," McComb says.
Owners/operators are free to offer the menu they think their local customers want.
And if you still wonder what a McRib is, McDonald's tried to explain his ingredients last year, with a video showing reality.
According to the video, McRib sandwich is prepared from pork, water, dextrose and preservatives.
The sandwich will be available by the end of the year at McDonald's participating restaurants.
There is also a website with locations where McRib (unaffiliated at McDonald's), which can be useful.
People can report on the website if they discover restaurants with McRib and can find the nearest place where this sandwich is served.
However, a quick search on the site shows that the nearest restaurant with McRib de Los Angeles is located in Sebastopol in Sonoma County, discovered last Saturday by Aidan Briggsonian.

Keith Richards understands that new recordings of Rolling Stones would be prepared
Keith Richards is again in the light of the reflectors with a new solo album and an appearance in a documentary, but soon, the other members of the Rolling Stones team might join them in the studio.
Richards announced that he and the others at Stones - Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood - met recently in London and made "clear plans for registration", as he says.
On Tuesday night, Richards spoke in the iHeartRadio ICONS series to reporter Jim Kerr.
A possible new album from Stones would be the first LP of the band after "A Bigger Bang" in 2005.
But the team wasn't completely inactive.
In recent years they have had many tournaments at the stadiums and played in several small concerts in L.A., including representatives at Echoplex and the Theatre Foundation.
Finally, they reinterpreted the 1971 classic LP, "Sticky Fingers".
Richards was particularly busy this year, working with the documentary "Keith Richards: Under the Influence", scheduled to be launched on September 18 on Netflix.
This year, he released the solo "Crosseyed Heart", his third solo in a five-decade career.
Randy Lewis of The Times described Richards' new album in a previous interview with the guitarist: "Always Richards' voice is a kinder instrument than distinguished...."
But Richards gets excited about all the 15 songs of the album and that always meant the rock 'n' roll.
In an interview, Richards says the team will most likely enter the studio after the South American tournament from the beginning of next year.
He did not give any other details, but judging by the last concerts, the band is still very full of life.
Toronto Film Festival: Jason Bateman on Childhood, Maturity and "The Family Fang"
Jason Bateman has already gone through a few difficult transitions in his career, with a discreet charm that made them seem much simpler than they actually were.
Some child actors in television shows such as "Silver Spoons", as adults, have reaffirmed their role as an inexpressive character in the television series "Situation of Crisis" and in films such as "Chiefs of Disaster".
The first film he worked as director was a very acidic comedy "Bad Words", in which he also played.
The film was nominated at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2013.
Bateman returned to Toronto this week with "The Family Fang", the second film he directed, an ambitious tonal film, adaptation of Kevin Wilson's 2011 popular novel. The script is written by David Lindsay-Abaire, the winner of the Pulitzer Prize, and in the film he plays Nicole Kidman and Bateman, as brothers with problems.
The film has a festival looking for American distribution.
Many reviews of the book considered it a comedy with powerful emotional tent; the film reinterprets the story, placing more emphasis on its dramatic, darker side.
In an interview given to our publication on Tuesday, Bateman says he has always considered the book more a drama than a comedy.
"I've never seen that book," he confessed.
In the book, the subject and topics are very dramatic and very human.
I thought Kevin was dealing with a very sensitive subject in a very funny way.
So that was always the order in which I saw things, a drama with moments of frivolity and comedy and eccentricity.
The world premiere of the evening month benefited from an introduction by the program director of the festival, Kerri Craddock, who expressed his particular enthusiasm for the sitcom "The Hogan Family" since the late '80s and early '90s, to which Bateman worked. "I haven't met too many fans "Hogan Family", Bateman said the second time he went on the scene.
However, the few episodes he directed from that sitcom brought Bateman, now 46 years old, to Directors Guild at the age of 18.
The story of his new movie has a family called Fang in the center.
Parents, Caleb and Camille (Christopher Walken and Maryann Plunkett), are artists with an average reputation, best known for the way they use their children, Annie and Baxter, in their shows, for example by putting in place a bank robbery with academia or by playing the role of very weak street musicians.
At maturity, Annie (Kidman) and Baxter (Bateman) are trying to find their own identity.
Annie is an actress with some reputation, although she's rather famous for public scandals than for performance, and Baxter is a novelist and journalist who tries to get famous.
When Caleb and Camille disappear in mysterious surroundings, Annie and Baxter suspect it's just another trick of theirs and try to discover the truth about their parents and find new truths about themselves.
I don't think it's hard to see what the story of the kids who want to evolve in adult life is reflected directly and deeply in Bateman.
"My childhood was a very atypical," Bateman confesses.
I started acting when I was 10 years old, with parents as managers, and this movie has many elements that overlap with the way I grew up.
So I couldn't see the story as a superficial and fun.
"It's a story I feel connected to and understood in depth," he added, "and although I didn't try to add my personal experience to it, I knew very well how to show this film in order to represent children with a non-traditional childhood."
The project started with Kidman, and she made the film, which obtained the rights for Wilson's book.
After Wilson refused to write his own adaptation, Lindsay-Abaire was co-signed, who adapted his own play "Treasure to Reality", in which Kidman played.
Bateman confesses that he accepted the opportunity to film and play in it.
(Kidman, currently on the stage in London in the production of "Photograph 51", did not participate in the month's premiere.
The audience of the book was in public.)
In Hollywood Reporter, David Rooney called Bateman's film "a clever and caustic adaptation" which "gives the kind of clichés much too exploited by the dysfunctional family and sometimes dissipates the mission of a lifetime to understand their parents in ways that can be funny and sweet, incisive and usually very dark".
In Variety, Justin Chang called the film "a very harsh portrait" and mentioned that Bateman "proves visible progress and greater maturity as film director with this smart structured but never too narrow or mechanical adaptation".
After the month screening, when Bateman and Walken came up on the scene for the question session, the public ovated the multi-bit Walken long.
About Bateman as director and actor, Walken said during the question session that "I was impressed every day.
I didn't come to believe the ease with which he changes the work of film director, which is very difficult, and the actor in the scene.
His concentration is really amazing.
In a certain scene of dialogue, Bateman sits on a ladder in the family house behind the frame, hiding in the armpit, just a shadow from the profile, while Kidman is closer to the room and sees more clearly.
It's not hard to imagine the Bateman actor talking to Bateman about the fact that he can't be seen.
"It seems incredible to me to film," Bateman said.
All my decisions come from this, I never take them to benefit me as an actor.
Having a privileged position to be responsible for creating the whole public experience, not just one instrument in that orchestra, being an actor, is a complete thing.
No matter what that... actor wants a plan.
During the question and answer session, Bateman confessed that after reading the script, he immediately thought of Walken for Caleb's role, but also of composer Carter Burwell for the sound column.
Known mainly for the long-standing friendship with Coen brothers, Burwell also composed the sound column for two other films present at the Toronto festival: the animation film "Anomaliesa" - a story about love and isolation directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson - and "Gangsteri de legend", Brian Helgeland's interpretation of the 1960s gangster twins, Ronnie and Reggie Kray.
Burwell composed the sound column and for Todd Haynes's "Carol" movie.
"The work with long or obtuse tones seems very interesting," says Bateman, giving more explanations Tuesday.
To navigate through those tones and guide the harmonious and somehow elegant audience from one to the next, during the film.
Carter built his career and an incredible reputation as a person who can navigate among the most complicated tones.
With "The Family Fang", Bateman took another bold step, both director and actor, in a career dominated by reinvention and determination, a mix of comedy and drama, light and dark.
As Bateman confessed when he finished introducing the film to the world premiere of the month, "Well, unfortunately, it came out exactly as I wanted".
The festival wants to be in Oscars about the history of Boston Globe research on pedophiles priests
Did you win $240,000 at the lottery?
An X-LOTTO ticket worth over $240,000 is unclaimed for a month.
The unregistered X-Lotto extract ticket was purchased from the England Farm Shopping Centre at Montague Rd on Saturday, August 15.
Along with the winning ticket sold in South Australia, another 16 winning entries have been registered throughout Australia, which have shared the estimated X-Lotto single-fund prize of $4 million.
SA Lotteries asks all those who bought X-Lotto tickets from England Farm Lotteries Kiosk to check them as soon as possible.
The winning numbers from the X-Lotto 3555 extraction on Saturday, 15 August, are 36, 23, 12, 6, 28 and 26.
The additional numbers are 43 and 27.
Kath Venables, the manager of the English Farm Lotteries Kiosk, says he is looking forward to receiving the good news that the one who won the biggest prize has checked the ticket to X-Lotto.
"We've tried to spread the news out of suspicion, because a person is our winner and has no vague idea," she said.
Criminal detectives are searching the house on Beadell Street, Burton, where the last time the missing man Daniel Hind was seen.
Hind's sister Chelsea Hind said it's frustrating to wait for information about her missing brother, especially because the police offered two different versions of his trip the night he was last seen.
Her family asked the police to search the apartment from her brother's disappearance.
"I hoped they'd explore the house, we weren't informed they'd do it," she said.
Ms. Hind said that her family also wanted those who knew what was going on with her brother to talk and tell the truth to the police.
"We just want to know where Daniel is and what he did that night," she said.
We're four kids and we have a lot of other family members and half of us think he's alive somewhere, and the other half I think he's not.
Anyway, we want him home and end the story.
By 2022, Bulgaria will add 635 kilometres of highway
By 2022, the Bulgarian government plans to build 635 kilometres of new highways and repair 17,000 kilometres of existing main and secondary roads.
The completion of work for Hemus, Struma, Maritsa, Cherno More and Kalotina motorways, all of which are part of the pan-European transport corridor, is among the priorities of the approved shoe infrastructure development plan on Wednesday.
The plan aims to create a sustainable rail infrastructure in Bulgaria and integrate it into the European transport network, but also to ensure increased safety on rails and efficient road transport management, the government said.
Bulgaria is a transit country for the trafficking of cultural goods in Syria
According to the Interior Minister Rumyana Bahvarova, Bulgaria is a transit country for the illicit trafficking of cultural goods stolen from the Middle East due to its geographical location.
During a speech held Wednesday at a conference on the fight against the kidnapping of the Syrian cultural heritage, Bahvarova recalled that Bulgaria's national legislation was re-established to fit the new context, placing emphasis on banning cross-border trade in Syria and Iraq.
Bahvarova, quoted by the Bulgarian Press Agency (BTA), said that the efforts of the competent units of the Ministry of the Interior, in particular the Directorate-General for the "Fighting of Organized Crime" (GDBOP) focused on preventing smuggling and the illegal sale of Bulgarian cultural objects.
He said Bulgaria is a country with a rich history, which recent studies have put on the third, after Italy and Greece, in the top of the traffic in cultural objects and goods.
Bulgaria's Interior Minister has further shown that trafficking in cultural objects and the destruction of historical sites in areas such as Iraq and Syria is a phenomenon that has become widespread, being described as a crime of extreme war.
He stressed the need for concerted and decisive measures to stop the deliberate destruction of history.
Director General UNESCO, Irina Bokova, mentioned that the filming of illegal archaeological excavations in Syria demonstrates that the country is affected by a robbery on an industrial scale.
The participants at the Wednesday conference acknowledged that Syria's cultural heritage is seriously at risk and that the international community must join in order to stop the illegal trafficking of cultural goods from the war-torn country.
Rockettyne Aerojet says the program for the new AR-1 engine could be modified
On Tuesday, Rockettyne Holdings Inc Aerojet stated that it is expected to finalise the new AR-1 rocket engine by 2019 to replace a Russian engine that will soon be banned, but the date could be modified if it does not receive enough funds from the US government.
Vice-President Aerojet, Julie Van Kleeck, refused to make statements about the fact that Aerojet offered $2 billion to purchase the United Launch Alliance (ULA), a mixed company with equal action for launch of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co.
Analysts say that the amount proposed is a strategic move of Aerojet to pass its Blue Origin rival, a company owned by the founder Amazon.com, Jeff Bezos, which develops a new engine that ULA wants to use for its new Vulcan rocket.
ULA says the Blue Origin engine program is about two years ahead of the Aerojet AR-1 engine, a statement that Aerojet contradicts.
The work on the new engines became priority after US legislators approved a ban on the use of Russian RD-180 engines for the launch of military or spy satellites, after the annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region by Russia last year.
Van Kleeck claims that Aerojet test hardware for the engine, which is designed with three-dimensionally printed parts to fit into both the ULA Atlas 5 rocket, now powered by the RD-180 engine, as well as the new Vulcan rocket that a ULA develops and costs about $1 billion.
The aircraft says it will be less costly and less risky to integrate its engine into the Atlas 5 rocket than to develop a brand new engine and a brand new rocket, as ULA is currently considering.
Van Kleeck says that Aerojet planned to start testing engines on a large scale in 2017, followed by obtaining the certificate in 2019, but the date could be delayed if the company does not receive sufficient funding from the Air Force in contracts expected at the end of the first semester of the fiscal year 2016, which starts in October.
It further states that the entire company was impatient to see how the Air Force would share a funding of approximately USD 160 million among rival competitors.
He also said that Aerojet was planning to try other private funding options for the engine, but did not offer details.
The Air Force competition is a public-private partnership and each of the bidders must provide a third of the funding, and the Air Force covers two thirds.
Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, and Blue Origin, both private companies, have self-financed the engine creation process and say they are not looking for real government funding.
AB InBev brewing company plans a $275 billion merger with SABMiller
Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), the world's largest beer producer company, has approached SABMiller's rival company (SAB.L) with regard to a takeover that would form a colostrum that would produce a third of the world's total amount of beer.
Such a merger would have a market value of approximately USD 275 billion at current prices and would combine AB InBev's domination in Latin America with SABMiller in Africa, both representing markets with rapid development, but also their beer factories in Asia.
"The real attraction is Africa, where AB InBev is not present, but also several places in Asia and Latin America," analyst Andrew Holland from the General Society said.
AB InBev and other top beer companies are trying to enter new markets and strengthen their weak spots in North America and Europe, where consumers prefer increasingly the beer produced by independent players or wine or spirits.
SABMiller, a company located in place of two worlds and the producer of over 200 beer brands, including Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell, said on Wednesday that he was informed of the intention of AB InBev to make an offer to him, which must take place by 14 October at the latest, according to British law.
AB InBev, controlled by 3G Capital, a private capital fund managed by a group of Brazilian investors, confirmed the approach.
3G, renowned for its policy of reducing the costs of marketing socote, has previously orchestrated the acquisition of Burger King, the Ketchup producer Heinz (KHC.O) and Kraft Foods.
An appropriate source of SAB mentioned that it is too early to say what it will do, as they have not received any offer.
"At this point, we are in the stage we wait and decide," the source said.
The speculations regarding a merger, which would most likely raise concerns about the breach of competition rules on markets such as the United States and China, have been going on for several years.
The time of approach, after more than a decade of acquisitions by AB InBev, follows a decrease of approximately 15% of SABMiller’s share price from August.
"This is exactly the moment they were waiting for," said analyst Phil Gorham from Morningstar.
From a financial point of view, for the first time in many years, it makes sense.
AB InBev will have to pay at least 40 pounds (62 USD) for SAB Miller's share, perhaps even 45 pounds, according to analysts, which would mean a total price of up to 130 billion USD, which would also include SABMiller's debt.
This would be the most significant M&A transaction in 2015, which is already announced a record year after the 2008 financial crisis from the point of view of the amount of the transaction, and one of the biggest purchases in 1980 then.
SAB shares approached 19.9% at 36.14 pounds, giving them a US$90 billion stock exchange capitalisation.
AB InBev shares reached 6.4%.
The rivals Heineken (HEIN.AS), Carlsberg (CARLb.CO) and Diageo (DGE.L) suspect that SAB could seek another merger as defence strategies, as it happened in the previous year when it was offered to buy Heineken, but failed.
Since then, it has combined its African bottle of cool drinks with the Coca-Cola (KO.N), and in recent weeks there has been a suspicion of a combination with Diageo or with the Australian Coca-Cola Amatil (CCL.AX).
The overall market share of AB InBev, the Budwieser producer Stella Artois and Corona, was 21.1% in 2014, while SABMiller was 15%, according to experts in the Plato Logic industry.
AB InBev intends to report net debt to gross profit (EBITDA) twice from the current 2,5.
It is possible to reach the target in 2016, the closest realistic date to which the transaction could be completed, so that it would have a way to borrow to finance a purchase.
When he bought Budweiser's company, Anheuser-Busch, in 2008 with 52 billion USD, the biggest purchase of ice money in history at that time. he let the report grow more than 5 times.
A climb like this would allow him to accumulate a debt of 100 billion.
Family controlling AB InBev owns a little more than half of the company, while the two main shareholders from SABMiller are the manufacturer of cigarettes Altria (MO.N) and the Santo Domingo family in Colombia.
On Wednesday, Altria refused to make statements on the fact that they were addressed by AB InBev, but on 9 September, its financial director, Billy Gifford, said in an analysis conference that he regularly evaluates investment in SABMiller and that "this time we consider that the maintenance of assets is in the interest of our shareholders".
The Santo Domingo family could not be contacted immediately for statements.
Neil Dwane, the head of European investment, equity, at the Global Investors Alliance, which holds shares in both companies, says that AB InBev has faced increasing pressure to return excess cash to shareholders.
ABI pays a very high price, but the accumulation of income from small debts is about 15%.
But we believe that the profit obtained from this purchase would be a disappointing percentage, of 8%, after 10 years," Dwane said.
In any combination, there are significant weights related to the infringement of competition rules, especially in the United States, where companies hold around 70% of the beer market.
"The savings that could be made in distribution operations are large and the footprints related to the infringement of competition rules are even greater," said Erik Gordon, professor at the Ross Business School at the University of Michigan.
Such a transaction would allow Molson Coors to obtain 58 per cent of the company's shareholding held by SABMiller in accordance with the operating agreement governing it.
A change of control at SABMiller would automatically give Molson the right to obtain another 8 percent and appoint a new executive director of the company.
Molson, based in Denver, would have the right to the first and last bids for the rest of 50 percent.
A spokesperson for Molson refused to comment on whether the company was interested in an invitation to tender, but Molson's actions grew by more than 12 percent, at their highest value.
Any merger could also need to sell shares in China, where market leader is the association in participation of CR Snow a SABMiller with China Resources (0291.HK).
Heineken, Carlsberg or Tsingtao from China could be potential buyers.
Plato estimates that, after surrenders, the combined group could hold 28% of the global market.
AB InBev is advised by Lazard, and SABMiller is advised by Robey Warsaw, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley.
Pakistani police accuse a former Air Force pilot of helping Qaeda
The Pakistani police arrested a former Air Force pilot who had subsequently donated funds to the Taliban and Al Qaeda, reported on Wednesday police officers to Reuters, in a rare case targeting those who support financial activism.
Suspect, Syed Sheaba Ahmed, was detained in the southern town of Karachi.
It paid for the treatment of wounded Taliban militants at a hospital in the eastern city of Lahore, the police said.
He also influenced two militants involved in a May attack on a bus with members of the Muslim minority and the Islamic minority, which killed 45 people, reported to journalists the senior police officer Naved Khawaja from the Department for Combating Terrorism of the province.
It will be accused of financing terrorism, Khawaja said.
"Ahmed has financed the Afghan Taliban more, we are still doing research to see if he has provided financial assistance through his business or behind him is someone else," the officer said.
"Ahmed also provided further financial assistance to AQIS," he said, referring to Al Qaeda's organization from the Indian subcontinent, a branch of Al Qaeda founded a year ago.
This arrest is a rare success for the Pakistani police force, which faces activism, corruption and crime.
After the Taliban in December massacred about 150 people, mostly children, at an army school, the government swore to drown the activism.
There have been severe attacks, while the army has also gone further in tribal regions outside the law on Afghanistan's border.
But the militant groups remain a threat, and many of them come from Pakistani cities under the control of very weak police forces and with insufficient funds.
Ahmed, 52, used to preach at a mosque in the good area of the Karachi Army Housing Authority.
His public predictions were moderate, but particularly encouraging radicalism, police said.
He studied at the Pakistani Air Force College in the city of Sargodha and left the Pakistani Air Force in 1998, said another security officer for Reuters under anonymity.
He later went into the paint and chemical industry.
Rapper Rick Ross rejected the application for copyright for "Everyday I'm Hustlin"
New Yorker Rick Ross cannot claim copyright for the words "Everyday I'm Hustlin'," a U.S. judge ruled, refusing to complain against the LMFAO band, who sold shirts with a similar verse, "Everyday I'm shufflin'".
In a decision issued on Tuesday by the Miami Federal Court, district judge Kathleen Williams said Ross's slogan, the prominent part of his 2006 debut hit, "Hustlin'", is a short expression for which the courts have mentioned several times that they cannot receive copyright.
Williams' ruling weakens the process of violating the copyright that Ross, whose real name is William Leonard Roberts II, tried against LMFAO in 2013.
Ross claimed that the Los Angeles electropist, composed by Stefan Gordy and Skyler Gordy, copied Hustlin' for their famous 2010 song, "Party Rock Anthem", which contains the verse "Everyday I'm shufflin'".
The hip hop star said the LMFAO song is "a clear attempt to capitalise the fame and success of the Hustlin song".
He also gave Kia Motors to use the song "Party Rock Anthem" in an advertising campaign.
In his complaint, Ross claimed that LMFAO violated his copyright, selling shirts and other products with the slogan shufflin'.
In Tuesday's ruling, Williams says "Hustlin'," as a song, is protected by the law of copyright.
But Ross's three-word slogan is composed of ordinary words and cannot have copyrights, she said.
The judge compared it with other famous verses in music from the past, such as "you get the right one, uh-huh", "holla back" and "we get it poppin'", saying it is "a short expression, which all courts unanimously declared it impossible to place under copyright".
The judge did not decide whether the LMFAO song is an unauthorised copy of Hustlin's.
The process is scheduled for October.
Ross and LMFAO lawyers could not be contacted immediately for statements.
The case is William L. Roberts, II et al. v. Stefan Kendal Gordy et al., U.S. District Court for Southern District, Florida, No.

Dr. Carson approaches Trump in the most recent presidential poll of the Republican Party
According to the latest presidential poll for 2016, news politician Ben Carson is approaching bomb leader Donald Trump in the republican preliminary elections.
Carson got 17 points last month, while Jeb Bush dropped seven points in polls.
After supporting 27% of Trump in the most recent CBS/New York Times poll, Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, reaches the second place with 23 per cent, followed by Bush, television viewer Mike Huckabee, Senator of Florida Marco Rubio, each with 6 per cent.
Support from the Republican voters in the preliminary elections increased from the beginning of August to the beginning of September for Trump, Carson, the governor of Ohio John Kasich and former executive director of Hewlett Packard, Carly Fiorina.
Support for the last two, however, remains at the same number.
Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida and the one leading the Bush family standards, dropped by seven percentage points in one month, while the governor of Wisconsin Scott Walker dropped by eight points.
In the last survey, Walker's support is 2%.
Carson drew more support than Trump among college graduates (29% vs. 21%), while Trump is ahead of Carson in the preferences of non-university voters (30% vs. 19%).
Trump is more supported by men than women, while women prefer Rubio more than men.
37% of respondents to the poll said they are determined what candidate to support in their state's preliminary elections.
Those who said that I know who they're going to vote with support of Trump twice as much as Carson.
It is still too early to say for 63% of the Republican voters for the preliminary elections.
The results of the CBS/NYT survey conducted between 9 and 13 September will be made public on Tuesday, before a republican presidential debate.
Carson's rise in this survey reflects the view of Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders in front of the leader for the nomination of democrats to the presidential, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
The latest follow-up to CBS' presidential nominations shows that Sanders climbed 10 points and 22 points in Iowa, New Hampshire, respectively, among the preliminary democratic voters.
A leading ethics specialist says sexual robots should be banned
A leading ethics specialist in the robotics industry has launched a campaign that calls for a ban on the development of sexual robots.
Dr. Kathleen Richardson, a robotic expert at the University of Montfort in Leicester, England, warns that sexual robots could contribute to the systematic demise of women and children.
"Sex robots seem to be an increasingly important subject in the robotic industry, and the models from which they are inspired - the way they will show, what roles they will have - are very disturbing," she told the BBC.
Richardson explains that her campaign against sexual robots is not against sex but against exploitation.
Technology isn't neutral.
It's inspired by class, race and gender.
Political power inspires the development of technology," she said to Washington Post.
That's why we can do something about it.
These robots will contribute to increasing the degree of sexual exploitation.
Although sexual robots that are now made are still relatively primitive, Richardson is concerned that they are the first step towards something far worse.
It's a new and emerging technology, but we have to stop it from happening.
The industry certainly seems to be moving forward.
A few years ago, True Companion, the company that produced convulsive dolls, launched Roxxxxy, the "first sex robot in the world".
However, the concern about the potential dangers posed by artificial intelligence is not unusual, even among major industry representatives.
Even this spring, the executive director of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk, wrote about “the risk that something really dangerous will happen in five years.
In an interview with BBC last December, physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking warned that "the development of complete artificial intelligence could mean the end of the human race".
Great Britain Takes the First Refugees From Syria - RT UK
The following days, Britain will receive the first refugees who have fled the Syrian war, Interior Minister Theresa May announced.
They will receive assistance under the extensive re-installation programme of the government.
Asylum-seeking refugees arrive from camps at the border with the war-stricken country.
These are the first of the 20,000 refugees planned by the United Kingdom to receive by 2020.
In a speech in the House of Commons, the Interior Minister said the government "works fast" to ensure more arrivals.
In the process of receiving vulnerable refugees in the United Kingdom, it is imperative that the assistance and support they need and deserve be already developed.
I know that honourable members and the general public want to find out more about the number of persons and the date on which they are estimated to arrive.
May mentioned that the government must also make more plans to ensure that refugees have adequate provisions when they arrive.
I need to stress that the level of expansion requires careful and meticulous planning to ensure that everything is going well.
Me and the Syrian Refugee Minister Richard Harrington, we will continue to keep the camera up to date in this regard.
But I am pleased to tell the Chamber that we are waiting to take place the first wave of refugees in the next few days and we are working quickly to plan more arrivals in the coming weeks.
Prime Minister David Cameron drew the wrath of parliamentarians and militants when he revealed the government's refugee plan, many being of the opinion that the figure was too small.
In September, Cameron told the House of Commons that the United Kingdom "will rise to its moral responsibility" and receive 20,000 refugees from the camps in the Middle East until the next general election.
He added that refugees would not automatically receive complete asylum, but a humanitarian status that would allow them to apply for asylum after five years.
However, critics noted that the figures meant only 12 refugees per day, and former Liberal Democratic MP Paddy Ashdown said the measures were "directories".
Further, Ashdown has revealed that children included in this scheme will be deported when they are 18 years old if they do not receive asylum.
In addition, the views and important public personalities condemned the measures in turn.
In a common letter, great names such as Benedict Cumberbach, Colin Firth, Jamie Oliver and Keira Knightley said the response to the crisis is "too little, too late".
"It is a responsibility that must be shared with our European neighbours, not simply thrown on the shoulders of the countries close to the conflicts that take people away from their homes," she wrote.
Rubla Rehabilies on Global Insecurity Fund - RT Business
The Russian rubla was consolidated on Wednesday, trading 65.66 against the US dollar and 73.98 against the euro at the Moscow Exchange at 10:00 GMT.
In general, the Russian currency won seven percent of its lowest of 71 rubles for a dollar on August 24th.
Analysts say that the return of rubble was due to the investor's reaction to the current global market disturbances caused by China's weight, the potential increase in the US Federal Reserve's interest rate and the excessive reaction to cheap oil.
Brent's quotas increased by 61 cents on Wednesday, reaching $48.36 per barrel.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) traded 72 cents more, at USD 45.31 per barrel.
MOST CITIZENS: Most likely, the interest rate will increase in the United States by the end of 2015 - US Fed
"It is possible for volatility to say its word, fueled by uncertainty about China and by the rise of the federal interest rate, which will continue to give a ton for oil and rubble prices," said Rabobank's Bloomberg Piotr Matys, an expert on monetary policies in emerging markets, established in London.
Experts also indicate another factor that explains the strengthening of the Russian currency.
The main Russian oil companies Lukoil and Rosneft, whose contracts are linked to the US dollar, started buying rubles.
The global markets are waiting with their mouth for the decision of Thursday of the Federal Reserve, whether it will increase or not the interest rate.
The markets consider that what could be the first growth in the US interest rate in nine years will not happen and traded at higher rates on Wednesday.
NASA and the United Kingdom work together on the drone traffic system
NASA is already working with the US government and with companies such as Google, Amazon and Verizon telephone company to develop a database that allows drone pilots to reserve airspace blocks for flights.
Nothing has yet been established at EU level.
Cooperation comes as a result of a very widespread unrest in terms of the possibility of an air collision between small drones and commercial aircraft.
A new Forrester report describes the potential negative effect in green.
"Imagine thousands of drones operated by hundreds of companies delivering products or catching data in urban areas with high density, such as New York City, Chicago or San Francisco," the research mentions.
Without a common set of technological protocols and air rules, chaos could be installed.
According to this O'Cathain, Baroness of the House of Lords, the concern was amplified on the basis of reports on events at the limit of the production of an accident and drone operation over football stadiums, near nuclear power stations and Eiffel Tower.
"In the last two years, over 400 calls made to the metropolitan police have been linked to drone incidents," O'Cathain said.
Which is the solution: the construction of a system that follows all drones, especially those flying at a height of less than 150 metres, whether driven by commercial or amateur pilots.
"As many small drones operate commercial flights at low altitude, beyond the pilot's visibility level, or even fully autonomous flights, a certain air traffic management infrastructure is needed to separate flights, in order to ensure the safety of complex operations, such as the delivery of urban collects," she said.
According to NASA, this drone traffic management system will include services such as airspace design, methods to avoid unfavourable weather and wind conditions, congestion management, route planning and redirection using similar methods with rules for road traffic, such as signalling and belts.
They are expected to have a functional prototype by 2019.
The drone industry is going to explode in the European Union over the next few years.
"We already see small and innovative SMEs in the United Kingdom using this technology with significant effects in the energy, agriculture and the media industries," says Lord Tariq.
More than 670 licences for commercial drone operations were granted only in the United Kingdom by the Civil Aviation Authority in 2014.
The European Commission considers that the drone industry could generate 150,000 jobs in the EU by 2050.
Disce button: why does Facebook want to know what's bothering you?
"A Look Back" works similarly, collecting the most important moments (on Facebook).
But what will this mean for many users inside the virtual Facebook borders, who are now more than the population of any country?
First of all, of course, an empathy button will allow Facebook to understand you better.
The huge amount of Facebook - about 240 billion USD after the last statistics - is due to the unimaginable amount of data about the consumers it owns.
Every interaction, postage, appreciation and friendship you make are gathered and build a remarkable picture of a complex, in a permanent update, about your person and your preferences.
This is primarily valuable to advertising agents, who can use all this information to choose carefully what people will see on Facebook ads, by selecting those who are most interested in their products.
An empathy button adds another set of data and certainly opens a door for another type of advertising agent to use the platform.
While a sports company is looking for people who "appreciate" a national football team, charitable organisations and promoters want to address those who, for example, "empathize" with the refugee crisis.
Also, it will probably change what you see in News.
Facebook uses incredible algorithms of smart and sophisticated to restrict that huge universe of content that you could see in the smaller stream that you actually see.
This algorithm depends essentially on what you considered interesting in the past and, above all, what you liked.
There is no doubt that there is fear on Facebook that many interesting, but unhappy posts do not enter the algorithm, because people don't feel that they should be appreciated.
However, if Facebook understands more about what upsets you or makes you feel unhappy, it might decide to remove this kind of post from News.
Facebook has conducted experiments in the past to understand how what you see in News affects your emotional state and, above all, how this is transmitted from one person to another.
Academic environment representatives call this "emotional pollution" and, although it sounds left-handed, it is probably just a simple Facebook attempt (and published, with their agreement) to understand better the way their platform works and if I can adjust the algorithms to distribute more elements.
What's going to happen to the empathy button remains at Facebook.
The really exciting thing is the way a single company decides to add one button to its services can produce so many speculations.
The reason why this happens may be that the decisions made by Facebook - whether it involves the visible buttons we see or the invisible algorithms that work hidden - have profound consequences for us today.
Now we're spending a significant part of our lives in the digital world, which we're accessing to find anything, from love to comfort or a new job.
On the other hand, Facebook is a company and yet another leading a constant struggle for survival in the ferocious Darwinian world of technology and social networks.
The decisions that you make, including with regard to the new buttons, will be considered the most appropriate to remain in the race.
I think a lot of people can empathize with this and they'll soon have a button for this.
Biometric arms can anticipate crises in people with autism
In the course of ten years of research in America, Dr. Goodwin and his team have determined that body signals can anticipate these changes, sometimes violent, before they occur, thus giving assistants the opportunity to take appropriate measures.
The autism kids we work with can't tell us what's going on.
I can't say that his head hurts or that "here's too much noise" or "I don't like this professor."
If we want to understand them, we need to see what that means to transmit their body, and we need to do this in a mild and non-intrusive way.
For example, simple color display in an application can show the level of agitation. The red can be used to warn about behavioral changes, and the blue for lack of interest, giving the assistant the understanding that the person is bored and needs stimulation.
Data from hugs can be collected in time and saved on a secure server, helping caregivers understand the overall picture of how the person responds to various situations and what would be the most appropriate intervention.
I have to say very clearly that we do not read the mind.
Biometric sensors aren't magic, they need a man to be interpreted.
He added that his team would work with producers to further develop this technology, to be specific to autism.
The research was appreciated by Jane Carolan, Director of Customer Services of the Wirral Austic Society, who will present technology at the Autech 2015 conference on autism and technology from Manchester on 1 October.
When you work with people who suffer from severe autism, as we do, you see the spectacular difference that can bring to their quality of life the assistance technology. Now, iPad applications give, in their own words, a voice to people who have never spoken.
The robots help the autistic kids learn to play hide-and-seek.
"Who knows where this innovation could lead us," she says.
Assistive technologies can really change life and we feel that they are part of our mission, as a charitable organization for autism, to ensure that everyone has access to this information and is also part of the discussion of how we want to support people with autism in the future.
France will attack Isis in Syria "in the coming weeks"
In the coming weeks, French warplanes will launch air attacks on the targets of Isis in Syria, the government announced on Wednesday, just a few days after President François Hollande said the intervention was a "necessary".
France will launch the first air attacks on the jihadist group The Islamic State in Syria "in the coming weeks", defence minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Wednesday.
French air forces are conducting reconnaissance missions in Syria on 8 September, and attacks will follow "in the coming weeks as soon as we have clearly identified targets," Le Drian said for the French Inter radio station.
Le Drian said in parliament on Tuesday that the Islamic state made "very significant progress" in Syria, especially in the northern region of Aleppo.
"In the town of Mare there is an extremely strong offensive, and if it succeeds, it could destroy what we still call the Free Syrian Army or the Syrian national coalition or what remains of it," he said.
France is part of a US-led coalition that for one year bombed the Isis positions in Iraq, but Holland changed its strategy last week to expand the actions in Syria, under the conditions of political pressure accumulated on the basis of the jihadist threat faced by France.
The United States of America, Canada, Turkey and the Gulf States have already been involved in attacks on the Isis militants in Syria.
Blocking feature of iOS 9 ads will make the phone even faster
The latest version of iOS 9 is launched Wednesday and contains many new features.
One of the most useful for iPhone owners - and worrying for online editors - is the ability to easily block ads while browsing the web.
The new feature will allow users to download third-party extensions that block cookies, ads, pop-up windows and other types of advertising while using the Apple Safari mobile browser.
On the test, it was found that, after blocking the ads, news sites such as the New York Times are loading twice as fast, according to Reuters.
The blocking of advertisements also helps users to retain the use of data and battery autonomy.
Users will benefit from several advertising blocking options, including 1Blocker, Blocker and Crystal applications.
AdBlock Plus, a popular desktop blocker, has launched its own iOS web browser that limits ads; its creator intends to launch an extension for Safari in the future.
Individuals using advertising blocking software experience a few constraints.
Advertisements are still displayed in applications (this is where Apple earns money on iOS).
More and more media sites, including Hulu and The Washington Post, are trying to prevent their visitors from using such block features.
However, their use on desktop computers increased to almost 48% in the previous year.
The development of these raise great challenges for online media, which is largely free of charge to consumers and is supported financially for many years by advertising.
One report says that blocking advertising could cost online editors nearly 22 billion in revenue generated from advertising only this year.
To enable blocking of ads in iOS 9, users need to download an application for blocking ads, then access Settings -> Safari -> Content Blockers to activate an extension for blocking content.
Obama talks about terrorism and the crisis of immigrants with the king of Spain
President Barack Obama happened on Tuesday to King Felipe VI of Spain at the White House, where the two discussed various issues, but which probably fell to the importance of international cooperation.
Obama and the King have addressed the issue of the fight against the Islamic State and the growing crisis of immigrants in Europe - who already face hundreds of thousands of people who have left their country of origin to go west.
"Spain has tried very hard to deal with this problem in the past, with North African immigrants who are often involved in very dangerous travel, and the problem of human trafficking," Obama said.
Of course, the problem has worsened over the past few months.
Obama also stressed the importance of cooperation, especially in the context in which the Spanish territory of Catalonia will vote in the elections that will take place this month.
"With regard to foreign policy, we have firmly committed ourselves to maintaining relations with a strong and united Spain," Obama said.
The Supreme Commander further told King Felipe that he would like to visit the country before the end of his term of office in 2017.
"We receive you with open arms," Philip replied.
First lady, Michelle Obama, gave the Queen a tour of the White House and had a tea discussion.
That was the first visit of the royal couple to the United States of America from the throne.
After they left Washington, they were going to make a visit to South Florida.
Alfred Woodard joins the Luke Cage series team
The famous actress Alfred Woodard joined the future distribution of the Netflix Luke Cage series from Marvel. He will be an antagonist of Mike Colter, who plays the role of the superhero who gives the title of the series.
Woodard will play the role of Mariah Dillard - "a local politician from Harlem and the cousin of Cornell "Cottonmouth" Stokes recently announced, played by Mahershala Ali - who intends to bring an era of change on the streets he has grown up", says a press release.
Her personal life and career are given over to her by Harlem's newest hero, Luke Cage, but also by the infamous actions of her cousin, Cottonmouth.
"Alfre has an incredible, unique and frightening presence on the screen, which makes it perfect for the role of the community leader in Harlem," says Jeff Loeb, executive producer and President Marvel Television.
We are pleased that an actress as famous and talented as Alfrede has agreed to join us in this adventure.
The show will have the premiere in 2016.
Cheo Hodari Coker will write the first two episodes and will work as showrunner and executive producer.
Woodard, aged 62, is known for TV Hill Street Blues, St. Elsewhere, L.A. Law, desperate wives and lawyer's office, but also for films The Devil's Advocate, Mystery Obsession, The Family That Preys, 12 years of slavery and Annabelle.
Luke Cage is one of the four Marvel series from the Netflix francisan.
Also, Jessica Jones and Iron Fist will soon be broadcast, but also the second season of Daredevil.
"Scream Queens" and "Empire" have the world's first in the same day
Fox predicts many positive results ahead of two of his expected series: Scream Queens and Empire.
The first season of Queens and the second of Empire will be broadcast on all Fox International channels one day after the internal premiere.
According to Variety, the strategy is a trend applied to high profile series, as global social networks traffic ensures success.
"Hollywood realizes how important it is to value the common voice of sincere international fans, especially for the series that is very much talked about, such as Empire and Scream Queens," Fox International channel president Hernan Lopez said, according to Deadline.
"We can't wait to broadcast these very interesting series to fans all over the world," Lopez continued.
Telespectors we serve every day bring the success of a series to the premiere and throughout his life cycle.
The next season in Empire, in which they will play famous sights such as Mariah Carey and Vivica A. Fox, has the premiere in September.
The new Scream Queens series, in which Emma Roberts and Ariana Grande will play, will be broadcast the second day in September.
Members of the British royal family will participate in the world premiere of the movie "Spectre"
Prince Harry and Dukes and Dukes of Cambridge will take part in London next month at the world premiere of the most recent film with James Bond, "Spectre".
The Kensington Palace announced the news on Twitter on Wednesday, appointing the premiere of the Royal Film Performance for Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund.
According to a press release by producers, "Spectre" is the third Bond film selected as RFP from 1946.
In the past, for the royal premieres were selected and "Don't Die Today" (2002) and Casino Royale (2006).
This year's event takes place on October 26th. at the Royal Albert Hall in London and will be a charitable one, which will result in the benefit of British film and television industry employees.
The premiere will also include actors from the film distribution, including the main actor Daniel Craig, Christoph Waltz, Lea Seydoux, Ben Whishow, Naomi Harris, David Bautista, Monica Bellucci and Ralph Fiennes.
Director Sam Mendes and producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson will also go on the red cover with members of the royal family.
"Spectre" will be broadcast in US cinemas in November.
There are rumors that Christie Brinkley and John Mellencamp would be together
The model Christie Brinkley and the musician John Mellencamp were seen taking dinner together for months, raising the rumor that the two would have a romantic relationship.
The two met to have dinner at Bowery Hotel in New York City, where the photographers surprised Brinkley with joy and smile.
The 61-year-old supermodel was seen wearing blouses, tennis and a yellow jacket, while the 63-year-old rock star was dressed in broken blouses, pants and boots.
Last year, in October, Mellencamp would have been seen again with his girlfriend, whom he separated and with whom he had a constant peace, actress Meg Ryan.
Mellencamp praised the message star for you at Today's NBC, saying it was "an angel that was sent to me and I am very happy".
He added that "nothing ends until it ends".
In August, Brinkley's youngest daughter, Sailor Brinkley Cook, took pictures of Seventeen magazine, walking on her mother's tracks.
The arctic tanning wheels are big enough to win a caribou
Many studies have highlighted species that have become more vulnerable because of the increasingly warm climate, but global warming has proved to be a blessing for others.
One of these species is the Arctic herb.
According to researchers at Dartmouth College, the warmer temperatures in the Arctic region allowed the tensions here to appear earlier and grow further, leading to the development of their population.
In a new study, researchers from the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding at Dartmouth, experts in the Arctic region, used their observations from the field to illustrate the effects of temperature changes on Arctic earthworms.
Their analysis anticipates an increase of 50% of the survival rate of adult pregnant women in the condition of an increase of 2 degrees Celsius of temperature.
These are small, but they are important members of the Arctic trophic chain and of the ecosystem.
The new analysis - detailed in a new work published in Procedures of the Royal Society B - aims to help biology better anticipate how a growing population could affect the species with which they feed, the birds and insects that feed with them and the plants that they pollinate.
To build their demonstration, scientists from Dartmouth combined their field results with the results of laboratory experiments that investigated how temperature influences the development of the insect and the predisposition to be hunted by predators.
Although increasing temperature makes the tensions more vulnerable to colopepters, it also provides early springtime and makes the development of their larvae faster and more efficient, which is certainly an advantage.
More ticks mean a larger population, which can only be developed to the extent that they can support the food sources of insects.
The ability of pregnant women to transform their improved survival rate into an improved breeding rate depends on their ability to provide their blood for food.
Antidepressants taken during pregnancy do not affect the child
Three new studies have shown that the administration of antidepressants to pregnant women has no effect on the neural or behavioral development of their children.
Studies have shown that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) present an increased risk of postpartum bleeding, but researchers have said that depression is a higher risk for women and children, and therefore should be treated.
"These studies add a growing set of evidence regarding the safety of antidepressants during pregnancy," said John Thorp, deputy editor-in-chief of the International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, who published all three studies.
Although there are some increased risks, so far the evidence seems to show that the risks of untreated depression are higher than those raised by antidepressants.
The Norwegian Institute for Public Health coordinated a study on the development of the motor vehicle of which the mother was treated with SSRI, analyzing the data of 51,404 children in the Norwegian cohort study of the mother and the child, investigating the effects of using SSRI for the development of the engine capability at the age of 3.
Researchers have found that 381 mothers used SSRI during pregnancy, and 159 of these have been treated with drugs for a long time.
Although exposure to SSRI was associated to some extent with a delay in engine development, researchers wrote in the study that the association "was not as significant as giving the latter a clinical importance".
A group of researchers from the Adelaide University of Australia conducted a data review for 49,000 Danish birth cohort women to discover the effects of SSRI administration on the behavior of children up to the age of 7.
The study found that unresolved depression in pregnant women was associated with an increased risk of behavioural problems.
In 210 of the children whose mothers were treated with SSRI depression, there was no increased risk of behavioural problems compared to the 231 children who were more prone to behavioural problems such as hyperactivity, lack of attention and socialisation problems.
The same group of Australian researchers also found in a separate study that mothers are more likely to bleed after birth if they are treated with SSRI.
Analysis of medical data from 30 198 who were born in a university hospital in Adelaide between 2002 and 2008 showed that the risk of postnatal bleeding increased by 5%, between 11 and 16%, if women were treated with SSRI.
The risk of severe bleeding or postnatal anaemia has doubled, researchers reported.
Researchers have said that although the study linked SSRI administration with increased risk, there are a large number of variables - from medicines taken during birth to the limited amount of information that researchers had on the specific medical conditions of women - that could have an effect on the potential for bleeding.
"It is possible that women who took antidepressants at an advanced stage of the pregnancy were those with the most serious stage of the disease, and this is the reason for the increased risk of postnatal bleeding, not antidepressive," says Dr. Luke Grzeskowiak, professor at Adelaide University.
Based on this study, we do not recommend that women stop treatment of depression during pregnancy, but should be closely monitored to reduce the risk of potential bleeding.
Matthew is charged with murder in the case of the murder of a student at Virginia Technical University
The man charged with the murder of Hannah Graham from the University of Virginia was charged with the murder of a student from the Technical University of Virginia who disappeared in 2009, the authorities announced Tuesday.
The big jury in Albemarle, Virginia, accused Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr. of murdering Morgan Harrington on Friday at the age of 33 from Charlottesville, officials say.
Matthew is also accused of kidnapping with the intention of rape.
Each head of the prosecution receives the maximum life sentence.
Harrington, aged 20, disappeared from a concert in Charlottesville in 2009, and her body was discovered three months later.
Her parents say the news of the prosecution brought relief.
"For six years we have been working resolutely and unbeatable for this purpose," says Gil Harrington, Morgan's mother.
I'm glad to know that when you take someone's life, you have to bear the consequences for what you do.
For Jesse Matthew, the dominoes of the consequences began to sit down.
Police say there is a medical link between Harrington, Graham and a 2005 sexual abuse in Fairfax County.
In June, Matthew was found guilty of this later and is waiting for the sentence in this case.
Stay in prison in Charlottesville.
Jesse Matthew charged with the death of a student at the University of Virginia
Harrington went to U-Va. on October 17, 2009. Together with his friends, to a Metallica concert.
The group separated when Harrington left John Paul Jones Arena from Charlottesville to go to the bathroom and couldn't get back.
Last time she was seen trying to take a cab around 8:30 in front of the arena.
Harrington was dressed in a black shirt with Pantera.
After her disappearance, Harrington's bag and mobile phone were found in the arena parking lot.
The family and friends began an extensive search for Harrington, a graduate of pedagogical studies, who wanted to become a teacher. Metallica people wrote about her disappearance on their website.
In November 2009, the shirt he wore was found next to a number of Charlottesville apartments.
Then, in January 2010, her body was discovered in an isolated lan, a farm in southwestern Charlottesville.
In the period of Harrington's disappearance, Matthew worked as a taxi driver in Charlottesville, but it is not clear if that period overlaps with the date Harrington disappeared.
Police say a significant advance in the Harrington case was represented by Matthew's arrest in the case of Graham's disappearance last year.
Officials who knew the investigation said these cases were related to DNA evidence.
The investigators have not made public at the moment the details of the new evidence that they have decided to put Matthew in charge of Harrington's murder.
Defence lawyer Douglas Ramseur, who represents Matthew in Graham's case, refused to make statements.
The notice of the prosecution comes two days after the completion of one year after Hannah Graham's disappearance in September.
This case is similar to the Harrington case: both were young students who disappeared when they left town in Charlottesville.
Graham, 18-year-old, from Fairfax County, was seen walking with Matthew in a mall in the center, near the U-Va campus.
Matthew was arrested for that case a few weeks later, after a national search.
Graham's body was found in October.
In July, Matthew will be tried for qualified murder in Graham's case.
In the early days of Graham's disappearance last autumn in Charlottesville, Gil Harrington represented a constant presence at meetings and sightseeings for the missing student from U-Va.
Harrington says that he endured for her daughter speculation and criticism in the media that has to be reduced to the silence of the new charges against Matthew.
"At all this time there have been discussions of the kind "Why wear a short dress?" and "And look for it with the candle?" but this kind of questions and judgment are not valid when it is clear that we have to deal with a predator on the hunt," Harrington added.
In the case of Fairfax County, Matthew was convicted of sexual assault against a youth in 2005.
The woman, who was 26 at the time of the attack, told the jury that, one night in September, while she was returning home from the store, a stranger came behind her.
He took her to a remote area, beat her and chained her to her neck, then attacked her sexually.
"I thought it was over, that I had to scream all the time," the woman confessed.
I was afraid I'd die.
Matthew took her away suddenly, said the woman.
One prosecutor told the jury that Matthew might have been afraid of the lights of a car entering a nearby parking lot.
He was sentenced years later, after DNA tests linked him to this case.
Matthew will receive his sentence in October.
Matthew will come to trial for the first time in the Harrington case in Charlottesville on Wednesday afternoon.
Dan Harrington, Morgan's father, said that he was most likely to come to Charlottesville on Wednesday and visit the bridge where his daughter was last seen.
"At least today we took another step," says Dan Harrington.
Is Jon Snow dead or not?
Actor Kit Harington gives us an indication
Actor Kit Harington gave an important indication of the fate of the character or of the Games of Thrones series, Jon Snow, who was killed at the end of the four season.
In an interview given to Dutch magazine Humo, he said he knew what duration the contract or HBO post had, according to Digital Spy.
Asked how many seasons he'd show up, he said he couldn't talk about this topic.
Let's just say the show will be part of my life for a while, I'll probably be over 30 when it's over.
But one thing is certain.
"When I leave the Games of Thrones, then there will be a time when I will get involved in long-term film projects," the actor said.
The show comes back to the small screens in the spring of next year.
The Fans Games of Thrones launched a wife after the end of the four season, when the character Jon Snow was stabbed and launched various theories, according to the car will somehow be read to life.
Moreover, the Romans created an event on Facebook, called the "Poman of Jon Snow", 40 days after the end of the season, which left over 36,000 supporters.
Good news for Romania from the European Commission
The European Commission decided on Tuesday to receive payments for Romania under the "Economic Competitiveness" and "Media" programmes, both interrupted at the beginning of April 2015.
According to a communication from the representative of Romania of the European Commission, following this decision, around EUR 120 million will be transferred to the Romanian authorities in the next period.
I am pleased to announce the release of these payments and I appreciate the efforts made by the Roman authorities to improve the management and control systems within the two programmes.
It is important that the Roman authorities have been involved in identifying weak points and solving problems.
"I express my hope that the measures taken will significantly reduce the risk of future errors and irregularities," said European Commissioner for Regional Policy Corina Cretu.
"The extremist declarations made by Mr Gianni Pitella are incorrect," the Hungarian diplomat's chief responded.
Peter Szijjarto asked European Socialists to stop the "campania de lieuni" at Hungary's address.
Referring to the statements made by Harlem Desire, the French Secretary of State for European Affairs, on the castle built by Hungary, Szijjarto stressed that Budapest "supports a common European strategy on immigration", but insisting that national borders should be protected.
Romania wants to hit the rugby World
Romania's rugby nation is ready for a big surprise at the World Cup that will start Friday in Britain.
The "Stars" proposed to win two victories in Group D.
"We want two victories, with the teams of Canada and Italy," said Mihai Macovei, the captain of Romania.
The national "tricolor" is part of Group D of the World of England, alongside France, Ireland, Canada and Italy.
Romania's first match since the 2015 World Cup will be played on September 23rd, next opponent to be France.
The Refugee Crisis: IAI No Solution
The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, announced that Thursday would take a decision on the possible convening of a European Union summit on migration in Europe.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austrian counterpart Werner Faymann called on Tuesday, next week, for a European Union summit to resolve the refugee crisis.
In a joint press conference in Berlin, Merkel said that Germany, Austria and Sweden cannot manage the refugee crisis alone.
The German executive chief expressed his support for the recent decision taken by Berlin to impose border controls on the massive flow of asylum seekers, stating that the measure aims to facilitate the registration of refugees.
In turn, Slovakia - which opposes the European Commission's proposals to redeploy refugees among Member States on the basis of compulsory quotas - has made a statement for the organisation of an extraordinary EU summit.
EU Interior Ministers, meeting in Brussels on Monday evening, failed to adopt a new proposal for an emergency redeployment of 120,000 refugees among the Member States of the European Union, presented on 9 September by the European Commission.
The first point of the plan, represented by the mechanism for the urgent relocation of refugees, provides for the rapid redeployment of 54,000 refugees located in Hungary, 50,400 in Greece and 15,500 in Italy.
Charlie Hebdo, new controversial cartoons
The satirical French publication Charlie Hebdo once again provokes controversy, after publishing a series of charges that undermine the response of predominantly Christian European countries to the wave of immigrants from the Muslim countries affected by war.
In the most recent number or, the publication has drawn attention again, as well as criticisms on social networks, Reuters writes.
One of the drawings highlights a fascinating image of Aylan Kurdi, the Syrian boy who was killed, whose body arrived on one of the beaches of Turkey, after an unsuccessful attempt to cross the sea by boat, by his family, from Syria to Greece.
Charlie Hebdo's drawing shows a child in short pants and shirts, with face down on the seaboard, next to a billboard that offers two menus for children at the price of one.
"So close to success," is the message that goes hand in hand with the drawing.
Another drawing, also the work of a caricaturer who survived the attack from the Paris editorial office in January, is accompanied by the message "Dovada that Europe is Christian".
The drawing depicts a character like Jesus, who walks on water, while a smaller character wears short pants with his feet up in the water, the first saying "Christians go on the water", takes the second "Muslim children" away.
The French magazine became a symbol of freedom of expression, after an attack by the Islamist militants in January, as a result of repeated threats after the martyrdom of the prophet Muhammad.
A chain of supermarkets present in Romania, drastic amendment in Russia
The French supermarket chain Auchan was fined with over $370,000 by Russian officials, accused of breaking food security.
Anna Popova, head of the Russian consumer protection agency Rosnejnadzor, said that the amnesties totalise over 25 million rubles, i.e. $372.000, is reported by the Associated Press, quoted by US News.
However, the reasons for these amendments were not specified, and Auchan did not make any comments.
The French supermarket chain is also the target of the accusations of the Russian Agency for Agriculture, which argues that some meat products have been found to be infected with bacteria such as E.coli and Listeria.
Food controls come within a period of tension between France and Russia, on the subject of the extension of European Union sanctions and France's decision to withdraw an understanding on the provision of Russian Masterships.
The Roman Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to the news that Hungary could raise a metallic fence on the border with our country.
The MAE appears to have been briefed on this decision and that it is not a political gesture.
MAE shows, in a communication sent to the newspaper Ziare.com, that it was informed by the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs about this intention with little time before it was announced to the public.
On the other hand, the MAE has informed the relevant decision-making factors in Romania in relation to this situation in good time, as a matter of urgency.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers that raising a guard between two Member States of the European Union and being strategic partners is not a political right gesture, in accordance with the European spirit.
This position has already been communicated to the Hungarian party, it appears in the communication.
Hungary plans to build a metal fence on a border segment with Romania, in the context of the immigrant crisis, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, quoted by Mediafax, said on Tuesday.
"The measure is necessary because traffickers who transit Serbia change their routes, there is a likelihood of heading towards Romania," the Hungarian diplomacy chief explained.
"The guard should start from the border point between Hungary/Serbia/Romania and continue at a reasonable distance if the migration pressure moves to Romania," Szijjarto explained.
At the end of August, the press reported that extra-Community immigrants crossing the Serbian territory on their way to the European Union were trying to bypass the fence built by the Hungarian authorities through its eastern tip, at the common border between Serbia, Hungary and Romania.
In this context, extra-Community immigrants have discovered that they can attack the fence through Majdan/Rade (Serbia) - Baba Veche (Timis, Romania) - Kubekhaza (Hungary).
The Hungarian government has allocated 22.2 billion forts (EUR 71.8 million) to build a controversial metallic fence at the border with Serbia, at a distance of 175 kilometres, and for special centres needed to accommodate immigrants.
The Guard initiative is criticised by the European Union and Serbia.
No need, you'll stay there.
The writing with the unsuspecting body of Cornelius Vadim Tudor will not be filed in the Senate of Romania, despite the desire in this sense expressed by the politician's widow.
According to a communication submitted by Ziare.com, the Permanent Senate Bureau discussed a request by Doine Vadim Tudor on Tuesday concerning the approval of the uninsulted body of former Senator Cornelius Vadim Tudor at the Senate headquarters.
"From the receipt of this letter until the moment of analysis, in the Permanent Bureau, the uninsulted body has already been deposited at a cult lake and will remain there, the Permanent Bureau appreciating that it no longer needs to be moved from there to the Senate of Romania," the Senate said.
Senator PNL Teodor Atanasiu has argued that this request "is not in accordance with Romania's geographical position somewhere in Europe".
He also broadcasts Agerpress, senators kept a moment of recollection in memory of former PRM leader, at the proposal of UNPR Senator Serb Mihailescu.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor died, Monday night, around 6:30 p.m.
The president of the PRM went to the Emergency Hospital of the Army's Cardiovascular Diseases.
The European Parliament will be buried on Thursday from 12:00 to the Ghencea cemetery, and will be part of military honors.
Are refugees coming to Romania?
The first of the granite towns, asked about the accommodation
Mayors of the Arad-Jewish border areas are questioned by the Border Police and Police in these days about housing places for potential refugees who could reach Romania, but also for gendarmeries, if they will be mobilized at the border.
The town of Nadlac, Vasile Ciceac, said he had meetings on this subject.
Discussions were held with farmers in the area, which asked them to report on the presence of any foreigners near the border.
I had discussions with border police, national police and local police, but also with farmers in the area.
We all need to be more vigilant in the next period.
"I have asked farmers, who have worked in this period on Arab lands, to be attentive and report any movements," the Edel said.
Immigrants' crisis in clocot in Hungary: Blinds and water tunnels at the granite
It, like other mayors in the border area with Hungary, said that the police had requested information on accommodations available in the event of a refugee wave.
We were asked how many people we can find.
We don't have room for refugees in the community.
We believe that such special centres should not even appear at the border, because they are more difficult to control here, migrants are trying to escape, because they are not interested in staying in Romania.
It would be best to establish such centres in more remote areas of granite," said Mayor of the Iratosu municipality, Papp Atila Iosif.
On the other hand, the mayor of the Dorobanti municipality, Vincentia Almasi, said he had been asked about both shelters for refugees and intervention forces, in case they were mobilized in the area.
The police were interested if we could make the case and the gendarmies.
We could find places on the Cultural Road, but for refugees we have no option to stay.
"We have been asked about the length of the border with Hungary, probably working on an action plan," Vincent Almasi said.
He added that at the local police station, "starting on Tuesday, since Hungary sealed its border with Serbia, it has been established permanently".
"There is always a policeman at the post, and locals know they have to inform if they notice any stranger in the area," the Edel said.
Prime Minister Pilu's representatives said that they can accommodate up to one hundred people on the Cultural Road, providing information to the police at their request.
The mayor of the city of Curtica, Nicolae Aanite, also said that there is room for accommodation in the former local public finance office, but there is a need for repairs.
Also a former Border Police barracks could be threatened to host refugees.
The representatives of the Arad Police Police Press Office did not offer an opinion on the question of primarys during this period, only confirming that "in the Arad Jewish border areas, patrol activities have been intensified".
Commander of the Army Club announced radical measures against the Becali Star
Commander of the Army Sports Club, Colonel George Boroi, announced a series of radical measures to be taken against the Star of Gigi Becali.
Although the two parties negotiated an impasse, Boroi argues that the Army will have its own football team, which will take over the historic palmares of the "Rose-Blues".
The team that won the Cup of Champions is still on the break.
"It's not a historical break, it's just a competitive break, because we don't have a team, but things can change from next year," Boroi said at Sport.ro.
At the same time, he announced that the process of requesting damage from Becali's team will continue.
The period referred to by the ICCJ decision is very clearly established.
We had to recover the damage from FC Steaua, the team that used the Steaua brand without the owner's acceptance - CSA Steaua.
It also appears very clearly the continuity of the section, which was actually permanent at the Army Club.
"So the Bucharest Star football team, in one form or another, but in another, in a legal form, must exist as a continuation of the performances it has so far in palmares," George Boroi says.
Becali's star and the Army Club are in wars open since the end of last year, when the Supreme Court decided that the soldiers are the ones holding the "Star".
Simona Halap crashed at the US Open: First Declaration of Romance
Simona Halap crashed at the US Open, as even the world's second players acknowledged on Wednesday.
The number two WTA has devalued that it has suffered a muscle enlargement, and at this point is a specialty treatment.
I suffered a little stretch and I'm doing a treatment.
"I hope to be back as soon as possible," Halap said at a press conference.
Simona Halap has evolved in the last two U.S. Open matches with an appreciable band of sizes across the left thigh, accusing muscle problems.
Immediately after returning to Romania, the Constantanca made a visit to the sports medicine clinic alongside which she cooperated with a good piece of time.
After the special investigation, Simonei was prescribed treatment.
Halap would be back in the competition next week, when he plays in China at the Guangzhou Tournament.
Region "collapse" by millionaires
This year, millions from Asia-Pacific will form the group of the richest people in the world, thanks to the accumulated wealth in China and India, showing a study published Wednesday by Capgemini and RBC Value Management.
According to this document, in 2015, the accumulated resources of the millionaires in Asia Pacific will exceed the total of $15,800 billion registered in 2014, as well as the funds of the millionaires in North America, which currently represent the richest people in the world, with a accumulated wealth of $16,200 billion, AFP transmits.
The study states that the Asia Pacific region already has the largest number of very rich people, named in the financial jargon High Net Worth Individuals, HNWI, with 4.69 million such individuals in 2014, a girl of 4.68 million in North America.
HNWI are the people who can invest at least a million dollars, regardless of the value of the property and other properties.
"In the future, HNWI wealth is expected to grow more in Asia Pacific than in any other region of the world, most of the new assets are expected to come from emerging economies of China, India, Indonesia and Thailand," is shown in the study by Capgemini and RBC Value Management.
The report estimates that China and India account for almost 10% of HNWI's global wealth and are responsible for 17% of the global growth of new assets after 2006.
China, the second world economy after the US, had in 2014 a total of 890,000 million dollars in accumulated wealth of 4,500 billion dollars, increasing by 17.5%, respectively 19.3%, compared to 2013.
In turn, India has the fastest rate of growth of the number of millionaires, 26.3%, up to 198.000 people, while their accumulated wealth grew by 28.2%, up to 785 billion dollars.
"Dorel" mounted the reverse semaphorus
At Suceava, workers have mounted a camouflage on the ground, so instead of being encouraged to wait four seconds, passersby receive the "h" message, which I don't know how to decrypt.
Don't bother them, no matter how much everybody goes through the red, informs the truth.
Everyone goes through the way he cuts his head.
Two guys were to be taken up by a car because they passed the red.
"Routiera politicians should be here to help, until the world gets used to," a woman said for the source quoted.
The Semaphorus was recently mounted in front of the Great Market in the center of Suceva, but passersby do not seem to care for it at all, with more than the information received seems to be incomprehensible.
After 6 comes 8, followed by an L, instead of a 9-8-7 series.
If "Dorel" did his job properly and found someone responsible enough to give him the ok to finish the job, then it would not have reached this absurd situation.
The Head of the Street Administration and Systematization Service of the Suceava Primary Road recognizes that it was a girl when the traffic light started to work, but did not realize that something was wrong.
We put them in use, but we didn't realize it was a mistake.
"Even I was the girl when they were put into operation," said Stefan Vasincu, promising that the problem would be remedied in the shortest time.
Thank God it can be remedied, because there are situations where "Dorel" has made the ruins irreparable.
For example, when he worked at the Giurgiu-Ruse pipeline, "Dorel" missed the forage cold that escapes the tunnel from under Dunare, it is not known where, probably on the ground, it was not found, as even the Minister of Economy, Mihai Tudose, supported.
Police put the guns with water on the immigrants
On the main border of Hungary with Serbia, Hungary's border was used, Wednesday, water tunnels and tear gas against immigrants.
Although Hungary has closed the granite with a gimped sarma guard and has introduced severe measures against illegal immigrants, including the arrest, at the sarbo-ungara granite, they have continued to gather refugees, writes The Guardian.
Water tunnels were put into operation when immigrants managed to penetrate through the sewer fence through the crossing point at the Roszke border.
Hungarian police argue that the action of the tuna was a control measure of the crowd, who throws bottles of water.
There are no reports of possible injuries, but some people shed tears after the use of tear gas.
The publication of Elena Enikos writes, at the same time, that two German companies refuse to deliver Hungarian gimmata.
The country has already raised the fence on the border with Serbia and Tuesday has announced its intention to raise one on the border with Romania, a strong initiative criticised in Bucharest.
German companies maintain that the gypsum is very dangerous and causes cuts that can be infected.
It is used to secure prisons or military facilities, but it should not be used against people looking for shelter, supporting companies.
In parallel with the border crossings of Hungary, Croatia has mobilized to make it available to bus immigrants to transport those present at the border with Serbia.
The Croatian Ministry of the Interior confirmed that buses were sent to the border to take immigrants to reception centres.
373 people entered Croatia from Serbia, of which 73 children, were shown by the Ministry.
Tsipras, on Greece's drama - why it agrees with the third agreement with the EU
The declared objective of former Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was to save the country from increasing austerity and change its fundamental relationship with the EU leadership from Brussels.
Finally, the Syrian leader from Greece made a third loan agreement for this country, which also involves several years of austerity and reform, according to Euronews, who is conducting an interview with this country.
Now, however, Tsipras calls on the Greeks to re-trust their prime minister's mandate in elections that support their political position.
Our aim was to reach an agreement, not an exit from the euro area or the demise of the euro area.
"Now, for the first time, the possibility of restructuring the debt for Greece remains open," former Prime Minister Ellen said.
Now, we have an agreement that can be described as a strict one.
"But I knew from the beginning that any compromise would have been concluded in the form of an agreement," Tsipras added.
It is of the opinion that the financing part of the agreement is a great success for the elen government, showing that all the country's financial needs are covered by 2019.
"Alexis Tsipras also says that Greece "surely needs reforms," stating that it must start with state reform.
Tsipras announced his resignation on 27 August, thus opening the way for early elections in September, after 7 stormy months in front of the Athens Executive, the period in which a third bailout loan was approved for Greece.

Activist from Star Trek, in prison for undressing in front of children
Actrita Jennifer Lien, known as Star Trek, where she played for three seasons, intrudering on Kess, was arrested for indecent exposure to children.
The incident that led her to prison, where she was from September 3rd -- the bail was set at $2,500 -- took place in front of his house in Tennessee.
The seer started arguing with a neighbor, Carey Smith, because of one of his children complaining, Mirror reports.
At one point, during the dispute, the actress raised her shirt, showing her the bust, because then, before going into the house, she would put her pants down.
When the police came, Jennifer refused to dress.
More than that, it threatened to kill the cops and was driven heavily to the car.
It's not the first time the actress at the age of 41 has problems with the police; in April, she was also arrested, then blaming herself even for the attack.
Jennifer entered the skin of Kes in 1995, after which she appeared in "American History X", a film in which she also played Edward Norton.
She quit acting in 2002, when her first child was born.
She's married to the writer and film producer Phil Hwang.
They're taken in a Western machine gun.
You don't support terrorism anymore!
Syrian President Bashar Al Assad gave a rare interview to the Russian press, in which he talks about refugees and accuses the West of supporting terrorists and "takes a look" at immigrants.
"The West complains for them and the West supports terrorists from the beginning of the crisis, when he said it was a passive revolution," said Assad, in an interview given by Russia Today.
The leader of Damascus argues that his Western counterparts say about the situation in Syria that he is a terrorist of the Islamic State, "but because of the Syrian state or regime or the Syrian president."
As long as this propaganda follows, there will be more refugees.
So it's not about Europe not accepting them or hugging them as refugees, it's not about not dealing with the cause.
If you're worried about them, don't support the terrorists.
That's what we think about the crisis.
"This is the core of all refugee issues," the Syrian leader added.
Assad continued the charges against the Western states and the treatment they showed to the refugee girl.
It is as if the West is now crying for refugees with one eye and is seeing them with a second eye, because those refugees have actually left Syria because of terrorism, in principle because of terrorists and crimes and in the second place because of the results of terrorism.
"When you have terrorism and destruction of infrastructure, you will not have the basic living resources, so that many people go because of terrorism and because they want to get their way somewhere in this world," Bashar Al Assad says.
"If we ask any Syrian today what he wants, the first thing he would say would be 'We want security and security for every person and every family'," the Syrian president stressed, adding that political forces, whether inside or outside the government, 'should join around what the Syrian people want'.
The President of Syria is of the opinion that his country's dialogue should continue "to reach consensus", which cannot be implemented "unless we break up terrorism in Syria".
"I would like to take this opportunity to ask all the forces to join against terrorism, because it is how we, as Syrians, want them through dialogue and political action," Bashar al-Assad said.
He also spoke of one of his country's allies, Russia's president Vladimir Putin, arguing that, in the context of the crisis in Ukraine, it was transformed, from a friend of the West, into his enemy.
Bashar al Assad compares the situation in Syria with that in Russia, accusing the West of falsifying reality in both cases.
Notice what happened in the Western press after the hit in Ukraine.
What happened?
President Putin was transformed from a friend of the West into an enemy and was characterized as a tar.
It is portrayed as a dictator who suppresses the opposition from Russia and who has come to power through non-democratic means, despite being elected in democratic elections, and the West itself has acknowledged that the elections were democratic.
Now, they're no longer democratic.
"This is Western propaganda," said Damascus leader.
Not least, it included Russia on the list of friendly countries - and regional partners - with which Syria is prepared to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, alongside Iran and Iraq, "because it faces the same type of terrorism".
Instead, Bashar al Assad criticised Turkey, another neighbouring country, as well as President Recep Erdogan and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who said that "I can't even make a move without coordination with the United States and other Western countries."
Moreover, Syria's president accuses the "international coalition", led by the United States, of fighting terrorism: "In fact, when this coalition began to operate, the Islamic state began to expand".
In other words, the coalition has failed and has no impact on the field.
At the same time, countries such as Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Western countries that provide cover for terrorism, such as France, the United States or others, cannot fight terrorism.
You can't be with and against terrorism at the same time.
"But if these countries decide to change their policies and realize that terrorism is like a scorpion - if you put it in your pocket, it will understand you - then we have no object to cooperate with all these countries, given that it is a real and not false coalition, which fights against terrorism," said the leader of Damascus.
Toomna?
Not a word.

The sky will also be in the east, where meteorologists announced 27 degrees in Botosani, 25 in Suceava, 23 in Pietra Neamt, 26 in Iasi, Vaslui and Bacau, 25 in Focsani and 26 in Galati.
In the rest of the country 30 degrees were announced at Targu Mures, 28 in Sibiu, 26 in Ramnicu Valcea, 25 in Pitesti, Targoviste and Ployesti, 26 in Braila, 25 in Tulcea, 26 in Slobozia, 27 in Calarasi and Giurgiu, 26 in Slatina and 28 in Turnu Severin.
Map of lands with the cheapest and how Romania stands
The decline in the oil quota has resulted in large losses for workers in the last year in the extraction of the title, the shareholders of energy companies and the countries that depend heavily on this resource.
But there is also a positive effect: petrol has been very cheap.
A chart compiled by Bloomberg shows that, in October 2014 - July 2015, in almost all 76 countries taken into account, the fuel price has dropped.
The most important reduction in the price of the pump is seen in Venezuela.
In this country, the engine has saved 97%, so you can feed 24 SUVs with less than one dollar.
On the opposite pole lies Saudi Arabia, where the price is kept fixed by the state.
The cost of the engine varies from country to country, depending on the conditions of refining, the changes in taxation, but also the fluctuations in the exchange rate.
For a more accurate comparison, Bloomberg turned the average price of each state into US dollars.
The situation in Romania
Bloomberg data show that in the second quarter of the year, the average price of a gallon of gasoline (approximately 3.8 litres) was $5.49.
Thus, we were ranked 27th in the country's most expensive fuel.
But we don't have to worry about this top position.
The last quarter of 2014, gasoline was also cheap to the Romans.
Then, the average price of a gallon was $6.14, which means a 10.6% price reduction.
However, the fares around are even better.
In Bulgaria, a gallon of gas costs $4.92, and in Hungary - $5.20.
The Nemts put the fate of immigrants in the middle of the night: What Merkel promised
German Chancellor Angela Merkel promised Tuesday night that the federal government would provide additional support to the 16 countries of the federation in receiving and distributing tens of thousands of migrants entering the country through southern Europe.
After a meeting of nearly 4 hours with the prime ministers of the 16 federal states, Merkel said "the most important thing now is to create an orderly and transparent process to face the large number of refugees," the DPA agency notes.
She added that the federal government will create 40,000 places for initial arrivals as well as distribution centres.
"There are such points of pivot required," she stressed.
The whole country must provide a massive boost to face the crisis, Merkel added.
The country's premiers asked for more help than the 6 billion euros agreed by the ruling coalition at the federal level after more than a week.
Turingie's Prime Minister Bodo Ramelow from the Stanga Party has asked for a sum "at least double, and for commitments, to be accelerated", in comments to a local newspaper.
In turn, the Prime Minister of the country of Renania-Palatinate, Malu Dreyer, insisted that migrants be quickly integrated into German society.
"We need a national pact between all players, not only the federal government, states and municipalities, but also business, trade unions and civil society," she said.
Dreyer also asked that bureaucracy in manipulating refugees and migrants be accelerated.
She noted that Switzerland completed processing in 48 hours and the Netherlands in 11 days, while Germany needed more than 5 months.
Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer expressed similar feelings.
Until now, Bavaria is carrying the worst burden, with the most migrants arriving after crossing the border with Austria.
Seehofer, a powerful federal actor as head of the Christin-Social Union (CSU), a key component of the federal coalition government, entered into public conflict with Merkel after the Chancellor announced a virtual policy of open use at the beginning of the month, recalls DPA.
Mircea Lucescu is scandalous after humiliating infractions with Real Madrid
Mircea Lucescu was a nervous car at the end of the game with Real Madrid, which Sahtior Donetk lost with 0-4.
The Roman coach was totally disturbed by arbitration, saying that Sahtior lost his seat was disadvantaged.
Before the game, I said one thing I want to be respected.
Unfortunately, in matches with important teams in Europe, we are always disadvantaged by arbitration.
There are two totally different ways.
Our new one was given a yellow card right away, while the top teams weren't.
Plus, the first penalty wasn't in any way!
Mingea hit Dario back, without reaching his hand.
A similar level game should not be influenced by arbitration.
"Regreed that the arbitration broke the game," Mircea Lucescu said at the press conference.
"Ma'am, but what smells so ugly here"?
They were pieces of the broken husband
A crime of a sadism that came out of the commune terrorized the inhabitants of Târgu Frumos and Roman.
Yesterday morning, at the first hours of the day, markets in Târgu Frumos were able to see terrible scenes near the main market entry.
Next to the three graves, criminals have "absorbed" in pieces what seemed to be a man's body.
It was torn, but it lacked its head, internal organs, and genitals.
Finally, it was to prove that it was the body of an former officer who had been beaten by his wife, professor of geography.
"Iaşi's Day" has been talking to even the taxi driver who helped the killer, without knowing it, on the cart with his dead body.
His stories make you look like a bitch.
The one who alerted police yesterday about the fact that a woman who had three sacks of horrendous smoke after pieces of the body were found on the market was a taxi meter from Trgu Frumos.
As in American movies, the man helped himself to carry bags full of human pieces, which smelled hard, but without knowing it, the killer was a client for a race.
The taxi driver told, exclusively for the "Iaşi Day", the shocking scenes he went through, helping without wanting a killer to hide the evidence.
He carried with his hands the bag in which the body parts of the professor of geography, which he was transcribing.
She came to Târgu Frumos to hide the evidence of the crime, as far as her home from Rome.
Maybe he's got mine.
I didn't have how much you know.
Nea Mihai, as he is known by his friends who practice taxi in Târgu Frumos, has come to see over the night in the small town he lives in.
He saw American films throughout his life, but he never thought he'd ever catch it by himself who'd be the one who'd be behind the discovery of a sad crime, and he'd see with his eyes a piece of corpse.
It reports that, on the night of the month to Tuesday, it usually expects the arrival of regular buses passing the locality.
It is near the intersection of the roads to Roman and to Pascani.
The taxi driver reports that the killer woman noticed it in the rear-view mirror, next to the body bags supported by the indicator showing the nearby locations.
She came in the night with the Massaro race from 1.30.
The car left it ten metres from the pedestrian crossing over the Pascani, right at the edge where the kilometer is displayed.
The bags were packaged with the indicator.
After the bus left, I gave the march ten meters to her.
I opened the trunk and, after I put a bag, I asked, "Madam, what smells so bad here?"
I saw she's an old woman, and I told myself to help her.
I thought it would lead meat to the market, to undo, maybe it's mine, I didn't have a way to know.
I thought maybe he wanted to beat someone with that ugly, smelly meat.
She was trying to pick up a single bag, and I hesitated to help her.
I put my hand on the top of the bag, where it was tied.
"He specified that I take her to the big market when I took her from the bus," he started telling her Mihai.
I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
He added that the woman said absolutely nothing, and, therefore, he was no longer curious to ask her anything.
Until the destination, I didn't say anything, 'cause I was nervous because he put my dick in my car.
And when he put the bags down from the car, I noticed that smell and hate.
She dropped the bags out of the trunk.
When I got back in the car, I put two feet back to get back, and I realized I couldn't stay in the car anymore.
I left the trunk open and moved the car over and over, to make the smell go away.
On the bus I didn't notice if someone was helped to get the bags down, because I had lights in the back and I didn't see well in the mirrors.
"There were two plastic bags and one shelf," the man said.
Seeing the strange behavior of the woman, he says he's starting to lose his curiosity.
In my mind, I realized something was wrong.
After she put her bags down, I went to the hospital, to Primaria, and when I got back, I especially looked at what the woman did with the bag.
In the meantime, she pulled the bag after the guard, where there are also the graves inside the market.
Then I left again.
There was a little agitation, because they arrived a microbus from Italy and a bus.
I saw how the woman went to their drivers to get into them, to disappear, but probably the drivers didn't want to take it, because they have international races, and they don't take passengers on occasions.
The woman was very upset, she's walking here and there.
At one point, the woman entered Peco and, curiously, I asked an employee outside what she did inside.
The employee answered that he walked and washed his hands.
Then I asked him where the police patrol was, because I saw her a while ago.
I looked for them and found them coming to the market.
I showed them the woman and I told them it was something suspicious.
"Then I went somewhere else, a race to Belcești," Mihai said.
He told us that the woman got upset after he left the bag at the graveyard.
To me, the suspicion went away from the fact that the bag was gone, and I was curious what he did with it.
When the cops went to her, they asked her what she was doing over there and they looked at me, telling her that I warned her that she had a suspect bag.
Then the woman went to the graveyards and showed them the luggage.
"I went back to the place where he hid the bags around 3:00 when I made statements to the police and the local prosecutors," the taxi driver concluded his report.
The German prosecutors, who are investigating the case, say that the 64-year-old professor, Ana Zaharia, was surprised by the cameras to take a look at a gas station in Rome at 0.55, riding on the three bags in the bus.
She arrived at the Fairy Square at 1.30.
According to the investigators, she would have killed her husband, with whom she had been married for four years, with a knife, and then she smashed him into the house.
The man's name was Gheorghe Zacharia, and he was a reserve officer.
On Sunday evening, the woman put the body pieces in two plastic bags, which she carried to the autocar, and hid them.
The other night, he carried one more, then decided which direction to go, and chose the Bucharest - Iaşi bus.
Last night, the prosecutors still didn't know where the woman hid her husband's internal organs, nor the genitals.
But the head was found wrapped in paper and bags, in a detachment from the woman's apartment.
She was retired, like her husband.
Until last night, prosecutors didn't find out from a woman who was the reason why her husband killed her with so cold blood and sadism.
Most likely, the professor will be mentally experienced, and the body will be examined by legal doctors, to formally determine the cause of death and any other relevant details.
The mayor took over the national roads from the city street, after years of government taking over, to be able to be robbed of money from the national budget in the 2004 election campaign.
The decision was adopted yesterday by the Local Council (CL) and, in order to be implemented, a decision of the Government must be taken.
Some sources say that the transfer of the right of administration from the Regional Directorate of National Roads was a condiment for the institution to deliver its opinion on the General Urban Plan (GAP).
The mayor took over a network of 11 km of roads.
In any event, a legislative amendment which was adopted in July 2015 requires the municipality to take the national roads that pass through the municipality.
No opinion can be delivered from the National Roads unless the law is respected, so it was necessary to approve this.
National routes have been in our administration since today.
"Of course, the government's decision will also have to be issued as a result of this decision of the Local Council," interim mayor Mihai Chirica said.
The national roads that call the municipality are DN 24 and DN 28.
The 28th Street National Road beats the Iaşul on the arteries: the Păcurari road, the Monteni road (to the Mafor), the Moara de Fire, the Silvestra Strapping, the Silvestra road, the Nicolae Iorga road, the Primáverii road, the Chişina route, the Tutóra road until the exit of the municipality to Tomesti - Albíța.
The other national road, DN 24, includes the Bucium shoosa, bd. Socola (up to semafor), Bucium street (up to Base 3), the Chisinau Road, bd. Tudor Vladimirescu, bd. C.A. Rosetti and the exit to Carlig-Sculeni.
Radu Gyr and Eliade
In continuing to describe files of Mircea Eliade's political sympathy for youth, which, however condensate would be presented in excess of the size of a daily article and should be broadcast in series, deserves, I believe, the friendship between Radu Gyr and Mircea Eliade, one of the most powerful charges used by the detractors of the great Romanian scientist.
A less immoral description would be, I hope, useful in the real debate that the recent law, called "anti-legionary", would have seemed to be embedded in the Romanian intellectual environment.
Examining the various versions that discussed Eliade's regiment in Legion through the Cube "Axa" and Radu Gyr, Florin Čurcanu brings into discussion the volume of Mircea Eliade.
The prisoner of history (București, 2003), another hypothesis, which is most interested in understanding the resumption of epistolic contacts between Radu Gyr and Eliade in 1968, after playing Ceausescu "the balcony scene" in August of that year.
Based on documents signed by Radu Gyr under pressure, during the security investigation, in 1941, documents kept today in the SRI archive (FD, File 573, f.15) as well as on a 1938 follow-up note, Florin Türcanu states that "Eliade will not enter their group, but in the so-called "legionary family" called Luminića, a group of "cuburi" intellectuals, especially writers, led by the poet Radu Gyr".
As there is no verifiable data on the Luminica cub, those in exile considering the existence of this questionable "legionary family", which must be discussed, are, to the end, the context in which this information was recorded in the file.
Leaving aside the surprising kindness of the SRI to make these secret files available to Mr. Şurcanu, it is more than obvious that, at that time, the aim of the search for security was "commandant" Radu Gyr, Eliade's mention was made, according to the note of 21 March 1938, in the context in which Armand Calinescu, the Minister of the Interior received free hand to take all the necessary measures to enable King Carol to impose his royal dictatorship, suspending parliamentary life and eliminating the main political force of legionaries who began to enjoy an unexpected popularity (All for the third country in the 1937 elections).
Eliade's arrest was carried out as a result of this note, quoted by Čurcanu: "Eliad Mircea, writer and journalist, in the Legionary Movement in 1935 in the group of writers and poets led by Professor Radu Demetrescu Gyr".
As far as I am concerned, I see this note as a subtle bureaucratic coverage for repression in 1938 and it is likely that such superficial notes would have been made at the scene for the vast majority of legionaries or supporters of active in public space who had to be arrested, but who had to be linked to an important legionary leader.
The holographic statement by Radu Gyr mentioned above, since the arrest in February 1941, after the defeat of the Legional rebellion, only confirms it retrospectively on the first, the banal method of bureaucratic coverage in any police regime, author.
It would be interesting if Žurcanu had provided more details on the contents of the 573 file mentioned.
Was it Eliade's file or Radu Gyr's file?
Because it must anyway be a file built on the security documents, but then processed by Security to be used either against each other.
There is a misconception here, as in the case of the use of the term "member" of the Movement, which only one who knows how to build the internal structures of this radical organization based on a religious basis knows that it is a pre-eminent stage, proof, in which the person in question acts as an active sympathizer, in the trial period of three years before becoming a "comrade" with acts in order.
Also, all these forms of secondary organization such as intellectual clubs or theatres, sitters, discussion groups with citizens, youth organisations or students were gravitating around a cube, were his "family", not his own cub, as a form of political organization and action.
This kind of nuances completely escapes the unannounced reader by making Eliade's "member" (which can be plausible) be understood and used ad liram to designate the political regime in the cube.
Of course, the appeal of such subtilities of interpretation cannot conceal the public activity of the Guard's support and no clear sympathy for the Captain who animated Eliade in the period 1935-1940, whether or not in the seat of Nae Ionescu.
Public support for a cause in which you believe, however, does not necessarily mean that the political regime itself is said to be so much more than, as a rule, intellectuals of this track retain a kind of superiority over activists as such and does not enter politics except when they are directly given high privileges.
As far as I could have formed an opinion about the idea of Elijah from that time, where he was "the leader of the younger generation", I find it hard to believe that he would have accepted the hierarchy rigors from a legionary cube.
And Radu Gyr didn't have Nae Ionescu's intellectual ascendant, though!
To no longer mean, but in the past, that, in any legionary "sufficient", what it receives is public anti-Semitic activity as well as violence, both worthy of being stigmatized, but not in the case of Eliade, until new evidence.
With regard to Eliade-Gyr's correspondence between 1968 and 1969, Mircea Handoca, an enthusiastic defender of Eliade, is trying to sanction Florin Čurcanu's claims (based, however, on some archive documents, even though she deserved to be dissected and contextualized more seriously) with a controversial argument.
The Handoca Mircea notes, in the volume Noi voiced on Mircea Eliade (Bucuresti, 2006), that "no line of correspondence between Mircea Eliade and Radu Gyr contains any allusion to this framework".
Nor was there any way in 1968, when, when somehow living out of the communist occupiers, Radu Gyr could not have risked any allusion in a letter that was evidently intercepted by censorship.
What I believe was that Mircea Handoca wanted to emphasize is that the tone of these letters sent by Radu Gyr was a respectful, admiral and affection without any doubt about Elijah's ascendancy.
There really isn't even the most palest suggestion that Radu Gyr would ever have been Elijah's boss.
Smart, the poet obliged to write at the Glass of Patriarchy, exposes himself from the head of the place the standing condition signaling to Eliade (who knew very precisely what the mission had that publication that was constantly dealing with denouncing the right exile), in the signature, after "your old friend", to wait and is easily visible and happy when it responds to him emotionally after almost three decades of separation since "the viclean time" has alienated him.
There is no doubt about the fact that, beyond the "mission" with which Elijah was entrusted (to convince himself that now, in the new Romania, he could return quietly at least to reveal his mother and friends) and that, possibly, he fulfills it dry and through short proposals, separated by paragraphs, to suggest their character as a foreign body, Radu Gyr shows no interest but in literature.
No mention of esoteric allusions, suggested refined political complications, or any mention of the years of youth in a register other than the cultural one.
It is hard to believe that Radu Gyr would have been superior to Eliade's legional line, but until this version is strengthened with less circumstantial evidence than that offered by Florin Türcanu, we have in this corresponding memory bricks that testify to mutual appreciation of some characters that have marked differently, but stately, our culture and that, beyond the trials of life, find the tone of interbelic civilization and education.
Important human and cultural documents and, why not?, pillars for the strength of friendship and mutual respect beyond the "under-time" fate of the authors.
In the early 1970s, Eliade finally gave up refugee status by obtaining American citizenship and, under the pretext offered by the country's health problems and disasters of floods, announced to the RSR authorities through the embassy (with a sporadic correspondence used to obtain a passport for his sister) that he could not attend the invitation to return to the country.
The follow-up was predictable: it is reintroduced to the index, it is mounted in Israel "the Toladot business", the books sent to the family and friends (Fragments d'un newspaper, Gallimard, 1973) are stopped by censorship, never repeats his mother.
Among friends in the country only with Noica has a sporadic correspondence, although, surprisingly, like a Chicago personal archive, a lot of individuals or Romanian institutions are more able to send messages.
It's clear why Radu Gyr no longer received permission to write after 1969.
And after 1977, when the Ceausescu regime tried Eliade's second conversion operation (by official invitations, Noica's actions, translations, etc.) Radu Gyr had already passed forever.
New coach, foreign players
Due to the shortage of indigenous volleyballists, Penicilina Iaşi was tested in sports tournaments in Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria and Poland.
The appearances participate in the training tournament under coach Dan Gavril
Back in the first half of the year of the A1 Women's Flight Division, Penicilina Iaşi kept her place in the first stage due to the withdrawal and then to the disbanding of the Miroslava Science, freshly promoted in the first stage following a barbaric tournament even in the issuing community.
The news took little of the unprepared leadership of the exit group, which woke up without the main coach (after the departure of Rares Puni, arriving second to Bacau Science) and many missing players, some retired like Cristina Lung and liberal Diana Studioanu, or left, like Ana-Maria Berdila (at the Volei Alba Blaj) and sisters Maria and Juliana Figa.
Only until the championship scheduled to begin on October 10th, there was and still is time to complete the lottery.
First, a new coach was found in Dan Gavril's person, coming from the male team LPS Piatra Neamt and who has worked less in the last years at Penicilina, he managed to sign a contract with the group led by the Left Vase.
Two players from Miroslava Science, Raluca Pichiu and Tatiana Diaconic were then brought, being tried and a few foreign players from Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Poland, closer to being the holiday player Katarina Jovanovic (from Amiens, France) and Montenegrin Jelena Cvijovic (Zrenjanin).
At the beginning of the month, the Peniciline lot led by Dan Gavril performed a canton at the Humor Gura, after which he participated in a tournament held in Lugoj and equipped with the Banat Cup, in which the appearances achieved a victory (3-0 with Cluj University), but also suffered two failures, 0-3 with CSM Lugoj and SCMU Craiova.
Next week, in September 23-25, Penicilina will take part in another tour at Craiova.
For the new championship, we're trying to build a valuable team.
We have a trained and experienced coach, but the player fund in Romania is quite small and that's why we will also call for volleyballists from abroad, especially after it has been decided that teams can use an unlimited number of players from outside the country.
This decision will affect the young generation of athletes from clubs in Romania.
"We hope to reach the end of the competitive year at 5-6 places, even if it will be very difficult," said ACS President Penicilina Iaşi, the left-wing Vasile.
Emotional meeting.
Gems assembled after almost 70 years
The twins George Skrzynecky and Lucian Poznanski, 69 years old, were born at the end of the Second World War in Germany, after their Polish mother had just been released from a labor camp.
Since she was too sick to care for her, the twins were sent to Poland for adoption, the two brothers were thus separated not only from the one who gave them life, but also from the other.
Ten years George and Lucian didn't know each other about existence.
At the age of 17, George discovered documents that showed that he was adopted and that he had a brother.
In the 1960s, he asked the Red Cross to help him find his brother, but they did not find any clues to lead him to Lucian.
Just in 2015, thanks to the program, "Restoring Family Links" of the Red Cross, the twins reunited, and the moment was more than exciting.
BBC reporters have surprised this episode.
Ten children from Iaşi brought home from Stuttgart four medals to sports dance
Two gold medals, a silver medal and a bronze medal were won by children who went to the German Open Championship in Stuttgart, an international sport dance competition organised by the German Sport Dance Federation and the World Sports Dance Federation.
Five couples from Iaşi participated in the Dance Energy Club and danced with 9,000 athletes from 20 countries.
The 10 children who were expelled participated in five different categories (youths 1, youths 2, young people 2, young people and amateurs).
Those who returned home with the medals were the pearls: Rázvan Andrei Zaharia and Ana Maria Tarzianu (two gold medals and one silver), Vlad Constantin Donosa and Otilia Stefana Gologan ( bronze medal).
And three other couples managed to occupy the front seats: Bogdan Stelian Sunday and Sara Maria Dolniceanu, Vlad Ene and Antonia Iosub Cujba and not last but Andrea Emilia and Raluca Elena Ioniçá.
As a coach I very much wanted to confirm the results achieved in March this year, this confirmation is necessary both for us and for athletes, in terms of their future evolution.
The fact that we have been able to hear Romania's immunity twice this year at the German Open and to return home with four medals makes us very happy and gives us hope and hope that we can lift both the club and its athletes to a level as high as possible.
"All of these would only be feasible with a few important elements: involvement, respect, trust and a lot of work," said Andrea Ramona Manolache, a children's coach at the Dance Energy Club.
Romania was represented this year by 34 clubs in the country, obtaining a total of 9 medals, thus qualifying our country in place 4 of the 20 participating countries.
Of the nine medals, four came to Iaşi.
6 methods to escape stress in one minute
Too few of us allow ourselves to run a weekend up the mountain to escape stress.
Some keep our time, others the financiers, and both the obstacles.
But there are solutions at the expense of anyone who wants to escape some stress.
They do not involve any increased costs and no special time allocated, according to lyla.ro.
Day-to-day care is inevitable, but it depends on us how we deal with them and how we deal with them.
Instead of grinding you inside and feeling like an implosion is happening in your mind, you better try the following relaxing tactics that don't steal more than a minute.
Take a deep breath.
Breathing exercises are not intended only for yoga soloists or practitioners.
They work for every person in part, and breathing regulation at a tense moment helps to release endorphins into the body, a process that leads to a state of relaxation, says Livestrong.
Be a child
We know we're over the age of childhood and we don't let ourselves get along when we have the boss.
But that doesn't mean that we can't go in a corner of the office office or wherever we know we're alone (even behind the building) and don't guess how much we're doing.
You can escape the nerves and negative energy accumulated during a day with a few healthy drinks.
Imagine a beautiful place
We know that the recommendation is worthy of replicating it during a psychotherapy session, but it's often used by psychologists.
Imagination of a nice place, which inspires us to calm down and seize the daily brakes, can lead to attenuation of nerves.
It is, indeed, self-injection, proceeding that can even change lives, both good and bad.
It all depends on what we're suggesting.
The best thing is to think about an idyllic place that warms our soul.
Listen to music
Put your castles in your ears and listen to the music of relaxation.
Attention, it's not about favorite music, because if it's heavy metal it might cause weight to relax.
Listen even to the tunes of relaxation, which are lines and do not contain verses, in order to rebalance the moment you light your fan.
Decoy the orange
Does it sound strange the advice to undress or a orange to the nerves?
Well, it's not!
Because it's not about fruit in itself, because it doesn't contain miraculous substances or Xanax to disconnect us completely (on occasion, too total).
It's about aromatherapy!
The smell of orange coyote, during decoying, stimulates the brain to produce endorphins, a hormone of good condition.
Mangae and animals
Those who have animals around them, whether it's the one who's at home or the one who's gone to work, take a few seconds to eat it.
According to the U.S. National Center for Infectious Diseases, the animal bite can lower blood pressure.
time and rock with violin and guitar
Two musicians in love with somewhat rival instruments, but collaborators in this acoustic project, sing Enescu, Vivaldi, Bach, Piazzola, Brahms, Mancini, Brubeck, Jobim, Django, Zeppelin, Purple, Queen, Floyd, but also famous pieces from the Roman folklore combining the violin with guitar.
The acoustic project belongs to the musicians Christian Horia and Emilian Florentin Gheorghe and is entitled WHEN Violin Meets Guitar,write hotnews.ro.
Florentin: "We found ourselves, and since then it has made us very happy to sing together, having a practically unlimited repertoire."
We thought this was the time when a violin was met with a guitar.
Cristi: "From the first meeting we realized that what we were singing is very good and that, from the point of view of the human component, things are working."
Each of us has learned from the other directory, and what is very important is that the sounds of the two instruments match.
Florentine: "I know there's a gap between classical music and the rest."
I think a lot of people can listen to classical music.
And secondly, we were still a Queen, a Deep Purple, our old rockers and, of course, jazz.
We want to find the bridge between genres, we want to offer a kind of music that could make those who only listen to classical music listen and rock, and those who only listen to rock get to like classical music.
And we were surprised to be told at the end of a concert that they never imagined they would listen to such a thing and they would like it.
Cristi: "When we find young people - and we find more and more - who know who Pink Floyd was, it seems amazing to us."
Students in Iaşi were more in traffic than at school on the first day after their vacation
Hundreds of exits were "captive" yesterday morning in the infernal traffic in several areas.
The mayor announced that today the Mangeron Boulevard (Bahlu's left), between Tudor Vladimirescu and Podu Roş, is closing.
The Chiefs of the Prime Minister did not comply with their promises of carrying out work to liquidate traffic at the beginning of the school year.
One of the assurances given by the municipality, at least twice in the last few weeks, has been the reinstatement of the rotation in the International Gender Zone.
Although only a few items had to be installed, and the last deadline for the work was the end of last week, yesterday the rotation was not carried out.
Driver nerves were stretched to the maximum on Nicolae Iorga and Cantemir, given that another Prime Minister's promise was also violated: the shift of customs activity from Nicolae Iorga to Tehnopolis "the late until the end of August", in the context of which this transfer has been discussed since 2012.
Currently, interim mayor Mihai Chirica says the problem of the International Race is more complicated.
The rotation will be made at the right time, we have to take into account the traffic of trams in the area, we need an opinion from the National Roads.
"It's not like in Zimbabwe, where it's time for the tram to stay in rotation, but we'll solve it in a way," Chirica said.
One of the solutions, according to him, would be stopping the tram with a traffic light before turning.
Problems in circulation were also in the intersection of the Red Bridge.
The code of cars from St. Lazarus Street extended to the SRI headquarters.
"I waited a good minute for me to get out in the Red Bridge," said one exit.
By Podu Roş in September, it was necessary to move the tram to the CUG, if the "Development and Rehabilitation Southern Arterial Rehabilitation" project was completed in the initial execution period (31 July 2015).
There are two projects that complement it at first.
"I have attracted European funds for new work, for example overextension, on the original version of the Nicolina Passion was narrow," Chirica said.
The most recent deadline for the re-introduction of tram traffic is October.
During the day yesterday, the exits reported problems in traffic mainly in areas such as Păcurari, Centre (Târgu Cucu, Independence, Armenian Street) or the intersection of Base 3.
Admonition could return as head of the CJ.
In the course of tomorrow you'll know for sure.
The judges of the Court will decide tomorrow whether judicial control and prohibitions will be maintained for the suspended President of the Jewish Council.
The judges of the Iaşi Court have resolved yesterday a new term in the "Album" file, in which he is also the suspended President of the Iaşi Jewish Council.
At the end of yesterday's sitting, the magistrates decided to take a decision on tomorrow's measure of judicial control currently imposed against Admonition.
It subsequently wishes to live or withdraw this measure, which keeps it away from the head of the CJ for several months.
In the case of a favourable solution, and if it is also mentioned by the Supreme Court, Christian Adomnition will be able to resume its office as President of the CJ.
Admonition was sent to the trial by the Antico Rominium National Directorate (DNA), accused of favouring the maker and false intellectual after, I say to the curators, he would have tried to mask an audit check which revealed a number of irregularities regarding the reception of a public contract signed between CJ and Laser Co.
Admonition would have tried to hide the fact that the institution which led it would not have received more materials to promote the Iaşi judge, although these materials were written as being received by the CJ.
Along with him, the justice and three directors of the CJ, as well as the administrator of Laser Co, were also referred to.
A further 3,500 results are expected to be put to the vote by 25 September
The premium is ready to distribute other questions if the 12,000 will expire.
The exits have only ten days to express their opinion on the replanting of their petonal Stephen the Great.
According to municipal officials, so far around 8,500 of the 12,000 questions distributed to the district centres and three additional points in the city have been completed (the Copou Park, Alexandru del Bon and Primărie Esplanada).
A record number of exits was presented Sunday in front of the Prime Minister.
According to representatives of the civic group "Iaşul loves yours", 530 members voted in 140 minutes, representing almost four votes each minute.
Instead, over the course of the month, about 440 came out in the same place.
The group's volunteers say that many exits are calling for signalling and the new population to suffer inefficient public consultation.
Therefore, they made a phone call yesterday to Internet users to print an information display made available to groups and stick it on block stairs.
Volunteers also showed that at the additional point in Copou Park, the last forms were completed by Sunday's exits.
We'll give you a form from the neighborhood centers, where it doesn't get very complete.
"Any additions will be made when all 12,000 formulations will be completed," municipal spokesman Sebastian Buraga said yesterday.
"Scruits of the teas" will end on 25 September, and if the majority vote of the outputs is in favour of replanting the trees then the Prime Minister will plant your silver in this fall.
The exits can express their opinion at the neighbourhoods of Dacia, Beautiful, Tatarasi, Nicolina and Pacurari, as well as at the above mentioned additional points.
The Chiefs of the Prime Minister have decided to cut the ranks of Stephen the Great in early 2013, an action that has attracted an amendment of 60,000 lei to the municipality.
The decision was taken unilaterally, without consultation of the population, and led to the spontaneous appearance of the civic group "Iaşul loves yours", an online community of about 13,500 people.
In the virtual environment, a petition initiated by the civic group for their replanting was signed, until last night, by more than 9,100 supporters.
RECORD of students enrolled in USAMV Iaşi!
I'm 920 in year I
The university has 920 students this year in year I.
Representatives of the University of Agricultural Science and Veterinary Medicine "Ion Ionescu de la Brad" stated that this year were the most eligible candidates ever admitted from the history of the higher education institution since its establishment.
We are very grateful for the results of this year's admission.
We have the largest number of candidates admitted to university history, nearly 920 students in year I. I have never exceeded such a number.
"We also had more media candidates, we occupied our seats from the budget to the license and master," said Prof.Ioan Ţenu, the professor responsible for the teaching activity.
It further stated that the university has registered a considerable number of students at tax, occupying 20% of those places, a significantly higher figure than in other years.
Although the results on the Romanian-language study lines have also been published, the admission to the English-language study programme from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, which has brought out 50 seats, where the fee is EUR 5,000, is still expected and the Minister's response is now expected to confirm the required student files and study visas.
At the autumn session, a total of 120 files were filed in all 14 budgeted seats and 209 entries in the "tax" scheme at the licence studies.
Most files were filed at the Faculty of Agriculture, in number 75, at Horticulture, 23 and at Zootechnie, 22.
At the master they filed in the autumn 18 files, on the 150 places at the fee proposed by USAMV, seven of them at Agriculture, five at Horticulture and six at Zooethnia.
Drivers are afraid to enter with the wheels of the cars in the wreckage of the Tudor Vladimirescu bridge
The bridge over the Bahlui on Tudor Vladimirescu Boulevard remained as curious as when "Iaşi Day" wrote about the problems they presented 10 days ago.
Our daily reports then signaled that on the axis that delimits the two senses of walking asphalt left, defending deep holes, some even 20 centimeters, showing the concrete plates that represent the main infrastructure of the bridge.
The asphalt also began to collapse on one side and on the other side of the axis, bearing in mind signs that the depths will be accentuated.
At that time, interim mayor Mihai Chirica states that the bridge has no structural problems, with a recent technical expertise in order to start a project to rehabilitate the bridge and tramway track, worth EUR 5 million.
Prime Minister Chirica states that the area affected by fissures and pits will be signalled, with rapid asphalt restoration work being carried out.
The only measures taken so far, however, have been the assembly of spikes and a signaling band, without even a simple plumbing.
During this period, we have focused more on opening up the school and the necessary work for this purpose.
"It is currently a point-by-point expertise for the bridge we are waiting for in about a week with the necessary details for the intervention, I appreciate that in no more than two weeks we can move on to remedy the situation," said the interim mayor.
At the beginning of the school year
Yesterday, my eldest son, Stefan, started school.
The class preparing, as he's trying to improve the situation.
I don't know if to enjoy or let me hit by melancholy; tend, passive, to the second.
First of all, because I have the feeling that it's only been three weeks, not three years since I first took it, with emotion, to the garden.
Even though she's breathing easily, no normal parent is happy to raise her children.
Secondly, because I remember perfectly the same day from my childhood; it started then a story that, the summit, has not yet ended.
I wasn't even what is usually called a conscious student.
On the contrary, I would say.
But I always liked school.
So much so that I chose to continue to attend, even as a teacher.
When I decided that's what I want to do all my life, I knew it wasn't an easy job.
And no one with a move.
That's because, like all of us, I've given it all over the professors: better or worse, more nice or unbearable, more you feel or have the right to be an imbecile.
It happens, unfortunately, that there are people with other calls in this braça.
I think they're toxic, because they hurt the enthusiasm and even the mind of a young man willing to form.
I was lucky to give, as I was a student or a student, over a few, few, exceptional steps.
These meetings can be crucial if they are to be held at the right time.
Who thinks the role of the mayor is the banal of the transmission of information is bitter.
This can be done by anyone; to be informed, you can inform the student very well by yourself, that we are only living in a time of transparency.
A good teacher, however, models the minds of the students.
They're training them, they're upset with their thinking.
Staying at headquarters is not a privilege, as I think is enough, but a great responsibility.
Young people are very mofturous, demanding, unforgivable, and always willing to look for shelters in front of them.
That's how they dictate age, temperament.
As a teenager, we all thought we knew everything, that we had certain confidences about anything.
When we mature, we get to understand that we only have doubts.
Therefore, the role of a teacher is to get the teenager out of the category of self-satisfaction and make him think.
I mean, he starts to doubt himself, to ask questions.
Find out for yourself the answers, both they and the provisional ones.
Get involved in everything he does.
To direct him discreetly to the profitable models.
It's very difficult, especially because most of the time the student thinks the teacher is his enemy.
One who barely expects to catch the wrong foot to punish him.
But that corrects him, the unintelligible pure, rebellious, guilty of living full of old calls, looking at the mayor with suspicion.
That he just has no way of accepting his natural attempt to order him.
Teenagers are not allowed to stand up, do not accept restrictions.
Or, if I get the impression that I'm doing it, she'll get revenge somehow.
And, unfortunately, when there is a rigid person at headquarters, who is imposed by hard and does not communicate, the students are avenged on the subject.
There are thousands of such teenagers who miss meetings with great writers, because of the lack of tact of the Romanian teacher.
There are thousands of such students who have the impression that history is a collection of data, that maths are all that can be more tiring for their uncompromising mind.
I always ask my students: if you give a teacher that you don't swallow, who doesn't know how to communicate from man to man with you, don't let him get away from the literature you should go to.
How did it happen that I became the douchebag myself?
I had a very good teacher in the VI-VIII classes.
He has opened my mind to some texts that have spoken to the puber since then on his understanding.
I met in high school a university professor who opened my library door.
I was looking at him as a man from another world: he had the walls of the house covered with rafts of books.
I was lost in his library and I dreamt I had the same.
Now I might have it, but if I hadn't taken my luck, I might have decided to become a footballer.
Or a engineer or a lawyer or who knows what else.
I don't think such meetings are happening.
I don't think so.
It is essential that you give over the man who takes your hand and patiently directs you to your vocation.
And this is, most of the time, the professor.
Now, my experience helps me to discuss only what it means to teach literature.
Only literature can't be handed over.
There's no literature teacher, as there's a math teacher.
How do you fix the inefficiencies?
You can, as much as possible, approach him without the claim that you transmit petrified truths.
The mayor can guide the most reading, that's all.
But above all, it can take some miraculous encounters, between a reader and some books.
There are meetings that can change the life of the bank.
There are meetings that can open her mind, which can lift her up, talk to someone, tears from her eyes.
Therefore, the literature teacher must first of all succeed in making his students understand (he feels) that there is no divorce between literature and life.
On the contrary!
A great runner, Al. Paleologist, just said a seeming paradoxical thing: "How much literature, so much life, not vice versa!" and he was right.
That's why, a good dart prepares you for life, doesn't make you a specialist in an open field anyway.
Fortunately, we always have something to learn.
And we, the professors; or especially us, the professors.
Most of the time, a great truth is repeated only by inertia: not only do students have to learn from their masters, but also vice versa.
Ideally, the teacher should be a teacher, and the student should be a student.
Which, like any valuable young man, leaves his master when he discovers his own way.
A little bit I find him, he's right.
But the master was the one who lit the candle.
I don't think there's any greater happiness for a clean blood teacher than that to bear as many such divisions.

Should FIFA expand investigation
Justice in the US and Switzerland will proceed to new arrests
The US and Swiss authorities have announced that they will start criminal proceedings in the case of new persons and organisations, in the investigation into FIFA corruption, inform the international press.
US Justice Minister Loretta Lynch announced, on Monday, at a press conference held in Zurich, that the area of research on corruption in world football was widespread.
"On the basis of our cooperation and on the basis of new evidence, we will engage in additional criminal investigations at the address of new individuals and new organisations," Lynch said.
In May, more of the FIFA's senior officials were arrested in Switzerland in this case of corruption.
Many of them have already been extradited in the United States.
"We have hope that other people who have been prosecuted will also arrive in the United States," Lynch added.
Switzerland's Attorney General Michael Lauber, also at the press conference, said that his institution had seized several goods, including dwellings and land in the Alps, as well as financial assets, in the course of the investigation carried out in collaboration with the US.
"I didn't even get to the end of the first time," said Lauber.
So far, a very large amount of information, 11 terrabytes, has been confiscated.
At the same time, 121 bank accounts are being investigated.
A contract for the surrender of media rights to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and 2014 - Brazil has also come into the attention of researchers.
FIFA faces a major corruption scandal, after the US court has charged 14 people, including two FIFA Vice-Presidents and seven forum officials.
Detained persons are being researched for bribery and other benefits, from the beginning of 1990 and up to now, totaling over 150 million dollars.
Following this scandal, Swiss Joseph Blatter announced, at the beginning of July, that he resigns from the function of FIFA president, after being realized for the fifth time.
Beats like a movie at the theater
In the Soupkombat gallery from Milan, the Catalyst Moroşanu will fight with the "beast" James Wilson
A series of Romanian fighters, including the "scorpion" Câtélin Moroşanu, will take part on 2 October at the Supercombat fair at Linear 4 Ciak in Milan, the last before the end of November, in a communiqué sent to MEDIAFAX.
We were impressed by the atmosphere last year, and as I promised, we will return in this fall with a nine-star gala.
If we still choose an unpublished venue, a theater, then we promise to fight like in movies.
We'll have eight Romanian fighters in the event program.
In addition to the games with the eyes already consecrated, we will have another opening gala, which will include the best fighters of the new generation, including the Romanians Cristi Spepcu, Christian Stancu and Amansio Paraschiv.
"The full programme will soon be announced," said promoter Eduard Irimia.
Catalyn Moroşanu will fight in the Supercombat World Grand Prix Final Elimination gala with American James Wilson, known after he participated in the last pyramid in 2012 in the heavy category organized in Japan and numerous awards from bodybuilding contests.
I can't wait to fight in Italy.
I saw Wilson, he's really an animal, but I'm demolishing him!
I'm still angry that last year I couldn't fight at the end, so now I'm gonna take revenge on him.
"From the beast he turns it into a cat," said Moroşanu.
Undefeated in 2015, brothers Andrei and Bogdan Stoica will have in Italy the latest confrontations before fighting for world titles on 7 November in the final sea.
Last year, they both went through KO in Italy, and now I promise they'll repeat the script.
I'm happy to be back in Italy, last year's atmosphere was incredible.
"I can't wait to meet the fans from there and promise them a new show of nuitity," world champion Andrei Stoica said.
In Milan, Raul Catinaş will also fight an opponent who is to be established.
A little girl invited the Queen of England on her day, but she also argued in writing
A little girl in Britain sent Queen Elizabeth an invitation to participate in her birthday.
At the same time, the six-year-old girl congratulated the Queen for the longest reign, but she did not forget to mention that she was not allowed access to the Buckingham Palace when she went to visit her family.
The writer did not leave the echo, but the girl received a reply from the representatives of the Royal House.
The Queen thanked her for her invitation, but apologized that she could not be present on September 27th, because she even hated her having fun with family and friends.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor and Adrian Păunescu were invited together to a talk show shortly before the poet Adrian Păunescu died.
Both writers died from the heart.
The fate of Adrian Paunescu and of Vadim Tudor is similar.
They were both writers and politicians, and they both stopped at close ages, from heart to heart.
Adrian Paunescu at age 67, Vadim Tudor at age 65.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor and Adrian Păunescu were invited together in 2010, shortly before Adrian Păunescu died, on a TV reality post.
Plin de verva, Vadim Tudor ironed Gheorghe Flutur and criticised Elena Udrea, the Minister of Tourism since then, for the situation of Romanian tourism.
At one point, Vadim Tudor said, with a smile at the jokes, to Adrian Păunescu: "I am jealous of your posthumous glory, Adrian."
I smiled, and he said, "It's not too loud what you told me right now."
Adrian Păunescu died on 5 November 2010, at the age of 67.
Cornelius Vadim Tudor died today, September 14, 2015, at the age of 65.
Two INCONCENTRAL persons after an ACCIDENT to Dumbrava
An accident took place Monday night around 7:00 p.m. in the village of Dumbrava of Iaşi Judea.
A biker was taken up by a Volkswagen car.
The cyclist was not observed by the driver.
Fortunately, they're both stable.
As a result of the impact, the mirror and the mirror of the car were broken.
Two injured people are unconscious at the time of transmission of this message.
A SMURD team is on its way to provide medical assistance to victims and to transport them to the hospital.
The cops are in front of the place.
A Syrian artist turned Super Mario into a refugee
A Syrian artist created a version with refugees of the popular game "Super Mario", which evokes the plight of his compatriots on their way to Europe.
Instead of presenting the adventures of the Italian installer Mario in the Kingdom of Cyprus, the modified video game has the center of the "Refugee Mario".
The person is trying to cross from traffickers and border police, on his way to a refugee centre in the European Union.
The artist established in Istanbul uses Samir al-Mutti's pseudonym for security reasons and said he made the video game with Mario's refugee after his friends went on a dangerous journey to Europe to escape the horrors of the war.
At the Craiova Detention Centre the youngest student is 15 years old and is in class I
At the opening of the school year at the Craiova Detention Centre, Justice Minister Robert Cazanciuc said that the youngest student is 15 and is in class I, and the eldest is 25 and is in class XI, showing that they could have another life if they went to school.
I chose to participate in the opening of the school year in a centre belonging to the National Administration of Penitentiaries to try to attract attention, and so on, to a few less known realities.
The youngest student, aged 15, is enrolled in Class I, and the oldest one is 25 and is enrolled in Class XI.
"There are complicated subjects that society is concerned about discussing right now, we are all overwhelmed by our own concerns and problems, but we should not overlook the lesson that you have given to over 100 young people from the Craiova Detention Centre," Minister Robert Cazanciuc said on Monday at the opening ceremony of the school year.
The Minister of Justice drew attention to the fact that the lack of education, motivated in many cases by the lack of material opportunities, may lead to tragedies, specifying that young people in this centre would have another chance to live if they could follow the Irish school course of any child, if they had the opportunity to learn not only to write, read, but also to get a set of moral values, to know what it means to respect the law and what consequences it could have.
"The role of the prison system is not to isolate the people who have violated the law permanently, to lock them behind high walls, but to try to educate them and prepare them, because when they return to the middle of the community they have more chances of reintegration," Cazanciuc added.
The Minister stated that it is necessary to invest in schools, hospitals, roads, but investments must also be made in the prison system, because, in many cases, conditions of detention are limited to humanity and because, in the absence of money and staff, it will be difficult to talk about reintegration of convicted persons.
We work very well with the Ministry of Education and, thanks to this partnership, every year in the penitentiary system, are more than 2,000 graduates of school courses.
Obviously, we will not be able to change over the night what has not been done for 25 years, but there are important steps we take.
"In all these measures we also need the support of society, and this support can only come if we demonstrate that we do our duty, that through your work these young people have a chance and do not pose a danger to society," Cazanciuc said.
The Minister of Justice has hated success for both students and educators, showing that success comes only through the joint effort of all.
"And because today is the celebration of the Holy Cross, I would launch an invitation to all students and teachers to visit the Mausoleum in the Soviet Union, and not only to understand what it means to fight young people for ideals," Robert Cazanciuc said.
A Russian came to vote with the bear
Doctoral schools with two plagiarisms to be disbanded!
Request from prestigious university students in Iaşi and the country
Over 200 researchers, university frameworks, personalities and students from the country have signed a petition launched by the Romanian Academic Society in which they ask the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research to evaluate, sanction and even dispose of doctoral schools in Romania "which allows and promotes academic taxation".
Among the signatories to the petition launched on 10 September are the teaching framework and teachers in Iaşi.
Among the university students signatories to the petition from the academic environment is, for example, Prof. Liviu Antonesei.
At the national level, the petition has names from former ministers of education, such as Mircea Miclea, cultural people who are also a university educational framework, such as Andrei Pleșu, Aurora Liiceanu or Alina Mungiu-Pippidi.
"Although the Law of Education provides for the evaluation of doctoral schools, this has not been achieved so far, thus leading to the absence of concrete sanctions for doctoral schools that flexibly violate the ethical standards of scientific research and do not produce relevant and internationally recognised performance," is specified in the initiated petition.
That request specifically calls for compliance with the National Education Act, the evaluation of doctoral schools, the suspension of the right of operation for any doctoral school in which more than two plagiarisms have been found, until the assessment and remedying of the situation.
The last requirement is the suspension of the right of operation for any doctoral school in which there is no minimum number of doctoral leaders provided for by law to meet the criteria laid down by the National Scientific Research Council in 2011 for eligibility to IDEI project grants.
Do you respect less a doctorate general, or a politician, or an informant in the Middle East?
"Why is there no other academy in Europe to give doctorates organized by secret services, and the top soldiers who give the doctorate to autonomous academic institutions, where the quality is verified by the academic environment?" said Alina Mungui-Pippidi, president of the Romanian Academic Society, initiator of the petition, who also originated her from Iaşi.
This can be completed by all the desires on the Society's website, and the final signatures will be submitted by organization to the Ministry of Education and Scientific Research.
We're not looking for 3 people with money, but 10,000 who want to get involved.
The "Pentru Iaşi" party, founded by young IT managers, was launched alternately in the Copou Park.
The president of the initiative group "For Iaşi" gave an interview "For Iaşi Day"
It will have a dedicated party exclusively for the development of the city.
A group of unaffiliated political entrepreneurs and managers has so far launched the party for Iaşi, which will propose candidates for the 2016 local elections.
Currently, the party's core is made up of IT specialists, but training promoters say that all people who want to be involved in modernising the city are welcome in the organization.
The launch took place on Saturday in Copou Park, and over 200 supporters participated in the event, almost all young people.
The special invitation to the action was Nicușor Dan, president of the saved Bucharest Association.
He was surprised at the 2012 local elections, when, from an independent position, he managed to raise 10% of the electorate's votes for the capital's primary function.
"The people I've seen at "For Iaşi" think they're very good at accessing Iaşi's public administration."
I believe in this initiative, I think it has a chance, I think it may have more chances in a community smaller than that in Bucharest.
"I'll always be next to "For Iaşi," Nicusor Dan said.
ZDI: Why didn't you leave Iaşi to work in an IT company abroad?
Andrei Postolache: The reasons are more emotional and emotional.
I've been away on many short business trips, living in Cluj for a year.
I came back every time, because I felt this is my home.
ZDI: Why did you now decide to establish a political party?
Andrei Postolache:Now that we have reached some maturity, we are a group of people who have begun to know each other for a while.
We met in professional contexts, we started discussing how we could get involved.
At first, we were more timid, in smaller things, with projects at NGOs, various building or charitable actions, and, somehow, things have evolved naturally and organically and now it happened to be the time when we reached the decision that we need to get more involved than that.
ZDI: Name three concrete projects to make local public administration activity more efficient!
Andrei Postolache: The first project consists of a minimum computerisation of the primary activity so that the different departments, institutions and regions cooperate as best as possible.
But more importantly, they can publish transparent data on the activities carried out in detail: budgets, reports, projects, etc. We are talking about informational organisation.
The second would be transparency because this leads to efficiency.
If you have a project in a particular neighborhood, public consultation of the affected people is important.
If we talk about efficiency, we don't have to forget the transport in common, we have the worst buses in the country.
We need to buy new means of transport.
ZDI: Today, the image of a city counts very much.
How would you promote the tie?
Andrei Postolache: Get on the plane and search for investors in this world.
There are conferences, industrial events where you can "sell" the city.
You have to want to do this and know to do it.
And here we have an advantage: we come from business and bring customers to Iaşi.
ZDI: What's the brand Iaş?
Andrei Postolache: My opinion is that we must be a city of technology, in one way or another.
We already have the IT industry and we need to expand it, go to medicine, enter the Robotic area, the 3D printing area, continue in this spirit and join such elements.
I think the brand should be in the science area, I mean the city's modern brand here.
Of course, Iaşul already has a historical brand that must not be changed, namely cultural city.
I see the two elements in balance: culture and technology.
ZDI: How will you compensate for the lack of experience in public administration, as well as the lack of traditional party structures that still win elections in Romania?
Andrei Postolache: Administration is a form of management, which means organization, planning, communication, working with people and project delivery.
We have experience in management.
We don't want traditional structures, we don't care.
We want to involve people, we'll talk to everyone, we won't just stay on Facebook, we're not an online party.
We don't want to have volunteers on the bus.
That means we're based on people who really want to get involved and help, and we think they're enough people like that.
ZDI: Should the Iaşu Prime Minister be more concerned about promoting the image of the city at national and international level, or is it necessary that the area of concern be permanently of a constructive nature?
Andrei Postolache: One without another does not work.
First of all, you have to solve today's problems, emergency.
Or if you don't make yourself known to the city, if you don't attract money in the city, at some point you're out of money and you won't be able to do it, for example, streets.
You have to do both at the same time and you have to have competent people with you.
The mayor doesn't have to do anything.
We have to give up the Prime Minister's model, who comes and beats with his fist in the table and solves everything.
Nope.
We're a team.
The mayor is the coordinator of an orchestra.
ZDI: Will you try to attract business people from the IT area who can financially support the party?
Andrei Postolache: We are looking for people who want to do something good, have an unforgivable reputation, be clear integrity and be honorable.
From this point of view, we don't have any other filters.
We're not looking for three people with money, we're looking for 10,000 people, or, why not, 300,000 people who want to get involved and do something for the city.
Interview by Alex ANDREI
Andrei Postolache has been working in the IT industry for almost 15 years.
In July 2015, Introspecials founded, after, for seven years, he was director of the Endava International Group (2008 - 2015), where he co-ordinated a team of 300 people.
Another four years (2003 - 2007) spent at Synygy.
The company that set up it with another IT specialist provides management consulting services.
The Rabla tractor program failed
The Director General of SC IRUM SA Reghin, Mircea Oltan, said that the programme to stimulate the renewal of the national park of tractors and agricultural vehicles, launched in 2011, also known as Rabla for tractors, was a failure due to bureaucracy.
With regard to the Rabla Programme, there have been some trials in recent years, but it has proved to be a failure, because the documentation was very laborious and complicated for a farmer in turn, and the approvals were too long and then the world gave up.
That program managed to sell it somewhere in 10 pieces.
"The need for tractors for Romanian agriculture would be 300,000 pieces," Mircea Oltan said.
According to this, Irum Reghin is the only company that produces several hundred annual tractors, being the largest in Romania, and that the major competition is exercised by companies from abroad, who know the needs of the Romanian market.
It is a very great competition with those who come out, all the world producers have put their eyes on Romania, I know these things that I have told you, and they have special policies.
"In all trades there is great accumulation, all producers exhibit, come with all kinds of variants," said Mircea Oltan, who pointed out that Irum Reghin produces around 500 agricultural tractors and forestry tractors annually.
By means of the Rabla tractor programme, launched in 2011, those who owned old tractors or other self-propelled vehicles, such as combinations, were able to deliver and receive a valuable 17,000 lei ticket in exchange.
The red flag has been raised
The internal vote of the Labourers seems more spectacular and more significant political, as the new elected leader automatically becomes its leader in future elections.
So raise the red-and-white flag/ Under its traps we'll live and die.
That's what Jeremy Corbyn did yesterday in the London Shrine House pub.
He's testified to many facts and oaths/ Let's not change his color now.
Readers who do not know the melodic line of this informal British and international left (Red Flag/ The Red Flag) can search it online and would not have been excluded from a surprise.
With our heads uncovered, let's all swear that we'll wear it until we're done.
The author of these ranks is not at all an admirer of the red flags (and not of those who fly them), but respects the democratic political traditions built around them.
If Jeremy Corbyn manages to join the left yesterday with that tomorrow, this love story between him and the Labour Party base will be part of a happy-end.
I don't think it will happen that way, but it seems premature to talk about the great and inevitable electoral defeat, over five years, of an elected leader.
Now, however, we can refer to procedures: we have attended a democratic exercise of an impressive scale.
Not British laborers invented the voting system directly for the party leader, in the middle of the west.
For a few years, French socialists have practiced a more complicated system, based on motivations, which allows the expression of all members and supporters; in addition, they have organised a preliminary competition for the nomination of the candidate to the 2012 presidential.
However, the Labourers' internal vote seems more spectacular and more significant political, as the new elected leader automatically becomes its leader in future elections.
It is, of course, also a matter of political system, the customization of power being more pronounced in Britain than on the other side of the Channel.
Moreover, participation in the vote was high in all three "circles": members of their own associations, trade unions and other organisations affiliated with the party and, finally, the group of supporters (who received the ballot after a summary registration procedure).
This latter group provides us with interesting information about the perceptions of the left-wing segments of British society, especially those of young or old middle-aged people, educated, interested in the political phenomenon.
Many of them will choose to be more involved, and in the future, just because of the signal offered by Corbyn's victory.
There are, as far as I know, sociological surveys that will tell us too much about the attitudes of this "outside search" Labourer, so careful speculation is allowed.
I think we are meeting enough similar attitudes to those of the Podemos (Spain) or even SYRIZA (Greece), with the observation that they will pass through the traditional channels of the left.
If we want to identify a term "anti-sist", it is first reflected by the rejection of the centralist line, New Labour (for many, only a dissimulated form of the multi-hulit thatcherism).
The second component would be the repudiation of the leaders considered guilty of the two successive electoral failures, one of the arguments being that they did not go left enough, that they were not strictly demarcated by the Tony Blair era.
The second reper - after me, and more suggestive - is offered by the recent referendum on Scotland's independence.
If we abstract the separatist message and concentrate strictly on aspirations on other political issues, we see how the Scottish nationalists have captured the energies of public segments in favour of the social state and animated by the aspirations of equity, the suffering of disarmament and the hostility of military involvement over decision-making, but also sensitive to the new themes of the left: ecology, gender, assistance to poor countries.
Scottish laborers have thus lost an electorate who should have at least had a privileged access, but who can now recover (see their enthusiasm for Corbyn's campaign).
Similarly, energy exists everywhere in the United Kingdom, but the old leadership couldn't attract them.
Jeremy Corbyn, with his outsideer vocation, has more chances of success than Ed Miliband, the "aristocrat" Labourer.
The comparison with Scotland tells us more, I think, than the left-hand anti-system of southern Europe.
The term "antisist" is too hard: "anti-establishment" seems more appropriate to me.
By next week we'll find out more about Jeremy Corbyn's first steps as the leader of the opposition.
We'll see if the Red Flag will come back in the House of Commons (it wouldn't be for the first time), after the new leader will occupy his place, first of all the opposition banks.
Anyway, what Jeremy Corbyn now wants from his colleagues in Parliament is first of all unity - and in this regard there is even reason to be concerned.
Manipulation trap with or without science
While I wrote the article, I went through the Internet to check the story of the former fighter and "Syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" who became part of the second space dedicated by V. Marin to his "Jihadist Laith Al-Saleh" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could in themselves make me from the beginning of the circumspect).
I didn't.
In last week's article (Europe, between refugees and "refugees") I commented in parallel on two photos - the one with the boy Aylan Kurdi found dead on the Mediterranean and the one, in fact: the two facing Syrian Laith Al-Saleh once as a fighter, the second as a refugee.
The story with Laith Al-Saleh was taken from the article "Syrian Fighters Come With the Valley of Refugees" (signed by Viorica Marin in Truth of 3 September).
Monday night, I put a link to my article on my Facebook page.
Tuesday, entering Facebook, we found, among other things, a handgun shot by a friend (not only by FB) Marius Cristian: "subscribe, but specify. Laith al Saleh is not a jihadist."
On the contrary, he is fighting Al Assad for democracy and that.
"So you could add the grossolana to the table!"
I have to admit, I felt bad.
As long as I wrote the article, I went through the Internet to check the story of the former fighter and "Syrian rebel commander Laith Al-Saleh" became part of the second part of the space dedicated by V. Marin to his "Jihadist Laith Al-Saleh" (the two categories - "rebel" and "jihadist" - could in themselves make me from the beginning circumspect).
Because I trusted the truth, his journalists.
Instead, I didn't have any other comment on the shooting by Marius Cristian but, "That's what I need if I have faith in the truth."
After that, I obviously took the big money story and felt indebted to readers with the correct presentation of Syrian Laith Al-Saleh's story.
The oldest we found in an Associated Press material (Syrian rebel leader seks Europe - Syrian rebel leader seeking Europe) signed by Nicholas Baphitis and Dalton Bennett on August 17, 2015 from the island of Kos in Greece, where they noticed, among the hundreds, perhaps thousands of refugees, a man trying to make an order in the chaos of the crowd.
The man was the Syrian butcher Laith Al Saleh in Aleppo who was "usual to be in command", since "he led a unit of 700 rebels in the civil war in Syria".
We also know that Al Saleh, 30 years old, had "a house, wife and normal life before he started the fight that cost over 250,000 lives and set out a third of the Syrian population".
In an interview with the Associated Press correspondents, Al Saleh reports that "everybody wants to leave Syria".
My city is the most dangerous cities in the world.
About 70% of the city is destroyed.
In Syria, Al Qaeda wants me, Daesh (an extremist group of the Islamic State) wants me, the government wants me to fight all of them.
In addition to being kicked out of a supermarket on the island, Kos would have offered him "a meeting and more sympathetic - with a man in whom he recognized an enemy of Syria": "Two days ago, I saw a Lunnetist from the government forces."
I didn't talk to him, but I'm still very angry.
From the material we learn that Laith (meaning "Leu in Arabic") was, in fact, on his way to the Netherlands, where he had a cousin - a former Syrian army officer and then he became a rebel and arrived in the West after he was seriously injured - hoping to get asylum and can then bring his family - his wife and a three-year-old boy (nearly a civilian war in Syria, which broke out in March 2011).
After this was achieved, Laith Al-Saleh would not have excluded a return to Syria to continue fighting for the Syrian Free Army (supported by the West) - against three forces: the army of President Bashar Assad (supported by Russian), the Islamic State and the Nusra Front, affiliated Al-Qaeda.
A madness - whoever wants freedom must fight not one enemy but three in Syria!
I've given more over a Serbian material since August 22, from which I didn't understand much, just that Laith Al Saleh is associated with terrorists who come together with migrants: Terrorists CREW THE MIGRIANTIMA calls the title of a news from http://www.telegraf.rs/vest, in which they are accompanied by a picture with Al Saleh with a beard holding a Syrian flag in his hand and that of a refugee wearing the THANK YOU shirt.
On September 7th, then, himself on BBC site, Mike Wendling drew attention to the case of handling photos with the Syrian fighter: This viral photo fake claims to show an IS imager poses as a refugee - This viral photo falsely claims that it depicts a fighter of the Islamic State as a refugee.
We find that the photo (in fact: pictures - that with Laith with bar and gun and that with THANK YOU shirt) was posted by a user on Facebook, who would be using and apologizing between time.
Just before that, just on his wall, the picture with the two pictures would have been scarred more than 70,000 times, collecting a few thousand comments.
That word, too late, the horse's gone!
In Romania, on 9 September, Carla Dinu from Hotnews took the story with the manipulation of the BBC, but mistranslated the title: "A fake photo becomes the virus shows an ISIS fighter being given as a refugee".
Obviously, the photograph is not fake, but the interpretation was a fake, wrong, short: manipulation.
