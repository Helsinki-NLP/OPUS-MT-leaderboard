The remains of UKIP that refuse those who live with HIV are a perfect example.
You are talking about when Nigel Farage says that the NHS should not be used to pay for those coming to the United Kingdom to make health tourism, and when, with this in mind, does he answer yes when the interviewer specifically asks if people living with HIV are included in the unwanted ones.
First, you use specific arguments, then discredit them with a barely veiled homophobia.
Every time my family and I need NHS, we have to put our backs on chronic hypocondria intolerants who think they're all due.
I think it's you who use specific arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by the right-wings, is virtually nonexistent.
I think that's what we call democracy.
So no one would be affected by UKIP measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
There is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A quote drawn from a torch is not evidence.
Yeah, so shoot the messenger.
The Mail did not write the report, he only commented on it.
Those who control most of the media in this country should be shot to spread such populist propaganda as if it were reality.
I don't think you know what a special argument is.
You know nothing more about my personal situation or my identity, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate with homophobia charges.
Farage's phrase is very surprising, but only because we rarely talk about this problem.
He didn't make any homophobic remarks at all.
You're gonna have to make it back.
I'm not sure where you want to come from, but I imagine you don't like it when the media talk about what you don't.
This is so rare because unlike Farage and his lonely disciples from Thatcher who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something of good then not.
Finally, the situation is as bad in Ireland as in Spain.
With the new crisis that comes the period of austerity will have nothing to do with it.
Expecting almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland, the 'Tiger of Europe' we boasted, a few years ago.
We've met the suite!
That begins reading the article again.
We are trying to make Ireland believe that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a 'new economic MIRACLE' is taking place.
With the Brussels agreement, taxes on the lowest companies in Europe, a three-fold shift in labour, continuing immigration.
With these ingredients not what ''pavoir''' for the moment with the coming of the Polish.
In the 1980s, Ireland was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, with Portugal considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was in front.
That their development has not been a long calm river, it is on account of recent events.
The lowest tax rate in Europe?
It's false!
Latvia has a 0% tax rate on companies.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France on the part of the policies on taxes actually paid by multinationals.
If a report is believed to be from 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5% in France in general.
Only SMEs pay full power.
Now I confirm that road traffic has returned enormously, and there are new (and expensive) cars with all the street corners, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I have lived in Dublin for 14 years, the resumption is evident in the daily loops since the arrival.
Is it supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will soon be burning.
In another article they're writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a sticker on the A140.
Does Ryanair now intend to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of equipment, so some bags and scratches on the elders will soon be forgotten.
That says I'm flying with him next week, so I hope it won't be on one of those two once again.
Then it would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair pay passengers an extra charge for the additional fear that we had been willing to provide?
But without this kind of Irish business, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man.
I never took Ryanair, and the last 3 times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers a quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can give it to the heart of joy.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair instead of those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay anything other than the basic tariff have only to take it on themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether it will be necessary to compensate passengers and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was an air traffic controller error at the airport.
Passengers were put on another plane within an hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
I'm sorry to disappoint you and your reparation dreams.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes the English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Good Travel
Last Sunday in Paris, Francs-bourgeois Street: the Marais is mostly pedestrian, and literally grows around the world.
People do not come in mass for the quality of restaurants (anywhere, most) nor for the Hall of Review in the White Mind Space (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that stores are all open and that the neighborhood is incredibly alive and animated.
With many foreigners who spend .....
Do you think Sunday's opening will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where the shops are open on Sunday, with 50% of tourists.
@aloes Faux!
The only argument that would seem acceptable to me is that of areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists and it is fuelled by the fact that they buy in detail.
Tourist areas lose a considerable number of business figures every year for the same reasons .
The industry remains where expensive equipment, operated on Sunday, allows prices to be reduced.
Sunday rest is a right for employees, except for exceptions.
That is why it is provided and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister for the Economy, nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs, have the least competence to reform the Labour Code.
While they're closing it up.
What's the law for?
To satisfy some of the population and businesses who want to work on Sunday .
In Montreal on Sunday, I take my little children to the municipal library.
In my city of 30,000 people where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is access to culture ...
And that is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism

What if her daughter's inheritance was, against her will, to use to pay her inheritance fees?
There are paintings.
Some are good, others aren't terrible.
No doubt his legacy would want his share of the cake, if you pass my expression.
His preference for a nationalist/Franco victory in the Spanish Civil War...
And its hostility to the independence of places such as Ireland and India and its fascist ideas as a whole, and also add its well-known hatred of the Jews.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
Not me anymore.
But for 5 years, and only for five years, it was perfect.
In 1940 he took the lead in other government aristocrats who wanted to discuss an "agreement" with the Nazis and he was very skilled at winning.
Thanks to its magnificent rhetoric and energy, it united the country in the idea that fighting the fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, France, and Belgium and, at the end of the day, the whole world can thank God for having had these five years, just these five years, Churchill at the bar and no other.
The size of Churchill has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell their paintings on the free market to raise the money of inheritance costs, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, they raise the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that when it was "the time of truth", Churchill's personality was a positive advantage for his country during World War II.
A relaunch of the internal market by public works will only encourage large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, as infrastructure structures are by no means renewable.
With regard to the social reforms proposed by the Minister, they well reflect the true misdemeanour: mistrust towards dialogue
Return to principle values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
May the weakest of us be not in need!
Whether we come to his aid in solidarity, or he has the right to exchange the services he provides or has given to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H I prefer to smick corresponds to this vision.
There is also the baker who sees incomes from his properties.
There is a difference between the one who invests for a return at the time of his retirement and the one who lives on his pension.
A good to rent or two for a couple upstairs, it's a vice.
The small genius of the Finance lacks particular imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of shortage in large infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
The developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal, so in nothing a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of growth emerges in response to a recession that is only a savage decline, therefore brutal
You would have been right 30 years ago: more need (or possibilities) of dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less difficult, then the need for investment is great: insulation, railway renewal, urban transport, transport and energy storage etc.
A taxability that promotes high income and income.
Who's in power?
Obsessed by smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a gallopinist.
Samsung's profits are damaged by iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
The introduction by AppleTM of larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 More may have seduced buyers who would otherwise have purchased a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided for the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a client, but not for Apple's sake.
I think it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft put in place this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
In addition, we all have different needs and they cannot be satisfied by one manufacturer because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I love their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people do not attach any value to the design, for them the options, functionality and price.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let's stop looking for "a better platform".
Is there "a better car manufacturer", not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a flourishing portable industry, with radically different approaches for people and different markets.
It's healthier and needs to be encouraged.
That's what's of our interest to everyone.
I'm happy that you found exactly what you're looking for and that it's not an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our umpfrontist friends who, according to one of them, fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, well on Parisian bobos) could tell us which author(s) they fight ideas about the kind and tell us what works they just want to fight.
Or are they just attacking the kind as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Is their source Judith Butler or Eric Zemmmor?
Well, John, I love you very much, and you're someone who's intelligent and cultivated.
I said this about Judith in the vein of Furusato, referring to Holopherne, who had not come to me (I did not have his spirit life).
Otherwise, in the "fund", since you're referring to it, I don't care, and I honestly don't see where the problem is: I hope you and your friends could get me out of my back, because I'm slow but I understand well...
@ Jean: acknowledge that, culturally, to send Judith back to Holopherne, that's what it is.
Who's afraid to ask the world?
But what are we afraid of those who are afraid?
Furasato and @ give us answers.
The first by calling on the Judith of the Bible , the second by qualifying Judith Butler as a very symbolic gorge stripper.
We see how much these studies touch the most intimate of them.
We are obviously no longer in the debate.
It's another thing, much deeper.
@ Have you read, John, that the World has published an article on the need for theology?
@: With regard to an idea debate, I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
Pretend to fight ideas from the only exhibition their detractors make ( Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Gender or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem very strict.
But, as I explained to our umpfrontist friend, it's all the difference between having a clear opinion and having a simple opinion.
I'm not sure he understands the nuance.
I didn't read Judith, the very symbolic gorge stripper, I was happy with the "Second Sex" (that was more than my time) which I believe is the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I looked at the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly appeared when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and made up for the disappointment that sometimes the sight was blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here in FNQ.
Yes, the clouds last night would really include the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had a clear time.
Special moon flash of blood.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey is responsible for the lab.
But if the Labour accepts our unjust budget, we will make it its true color as soon as possible.
That's what you're obsessed with, isn't it?
I was in Melbourne then, of course, I saw only clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover itself throughout the whole week of the meteor shower of the Persians and for almost all of the important astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I am beginning to think that there is a bad genius whose only purpose is to prevent the inhabitants of Melbourne from seeing what it is from the sky.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even though things greatly improve on the other side of the Cordillare.
There were periods from 10 to 20 minutes where I could not see the eclipse because of clouds above the Melbourne Bay.
I'm gonna put a TAXE on this eclipse.
WHILE looking at this eclipse, you should pay a TAXE.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last one before you go to bed.
Who or what shall abide with you when it (forces) to pass away?
It seems you spent a lot of time reading the discussions looking for messages in which people are criticizing the Abbott government to then accuse EUX of being obsessed.
Super photo of the moon above the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
We'd say Mars is going into conflict with Earth!
Nothing on stock and real estate speculation.
Nothing about inequalities between labour and capital income.

The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
No hypertext link to the original documents so that an opinion can be made.
Today, Tuesday, 15 October, you will see the results of miraculous revenues: in Spain, exports have been lowest for five years.
In Greece the stock exchange collapses.
Yet these are examples to follow.
The reform of the notaries would generate a claim for compensation of EUR 8 billion.
The Department of Economics claims that these claims for compensation are not substantiated.
What if the Ministry of Economics is wrong?
Will policymakers who have taken advantage of the courageous attack on notaries have the same courage in presenting the bill to the state budget?
Next in his time.
Okay, thanks, JYL.
@lol The State is not comparable to households with respect to the management of its budget, because the state's temporary horizon is theoretically final, while the household's life span is limited to its members.
In addition, unless public spending is considered unproductive, it contributes to financing tangible and intangible investments in tomorrow's growth and thus future revenues.
Some elements of the answer.
A sad decision.
But remember the sacred oath of Hippocrates: the health of the benefits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved first and foremost.
Nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately, the truth does not match your imagination.
Medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have hands tied by the law as written by politicians.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgical interventions, safe shooting rooms for drug addicts rather than having them in the streets, etc.
On these issues, politicians want to please the uncultivated masses.
In fact, doctors don't make money with drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
doctors don't make money with drugs Since the Liberals want our health system to look like the United States, you should know how it works.
Doctors around the world are being polite in the same way, but it's more or less visible.
It may have been poorly formulated to blame the tubibs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to business benefits and to "research".
Therefore, read a few rare reports on our pharmaceutical benefits scheme expenditure and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies compared to other countries.
Compare global drug prices everywhere, as well as differences between countries on what is being sold free or only on orders.
This is strengthened by a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, directly or indirectly.
In fact, some companies are testing marijuana inhalations against oncological pain right now, despite the laws that impede them and the necessary heavy permits.
Although manufacturers of certain medicines may not be happy that alternatives such as marijuana are used, those who arrive at a version offering good quality products at well-known doses will benefit widely.
I'm sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're mistaken, there's a lot going on in the medical and pharmaceutical hives.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put a bullet in the ear of a hospital manager.
We can't keep patents on the grass...
If social science researchers were doing research instead of doing politics and networking, their "work" could be used.
One researcher, he doesn't compare one fact to another.
Comparing it isn't looking.
Comparing it is not the teaching of research.
You can't say "the research is done" and then in the same jet, "you have to experiment at all times."
If your research has been completed why experiment?
If your research has not been completed, why do you ask to apply it?
Can I explain how a "researcher" can conclude that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other materials?
New technologies allow students to learn by the condition that they learn to use new technologies, but how would they learn new technologies if they do not know how to learn?
The pisa tests are only an indicator we make an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What does it mean to build an indicator that informs you of what is going on, a self-promotional will, a deception?
One way to train teachers is to get away from training sophists and ideologists and that practitioners teach practitioners.
factory release the paragraph on the internships (which helas is not very argued) and you will see that your conclusion leads us to the most ineffective conservatism: "It is a device that primarily leads to the reproduction of existing practices, and that does not allow the system to progress."
In view of the general consensus on the status of the French system, it is not desirable that only practitioners teach practitioners, even though they have all their place in modern teacher training
Theorists of education must have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who never set foot in a previous operating block?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the education system.
Giving more weight to educational theorists would mean permanently destroying it.
Your analogy is completely fuzzy: if I don't like to be operated by a practitioner who has only one theoretical training, I would like to be operated by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned about the bag.
Mike Weatherley, Conservative MP on the fight against copyright violation by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.

If one day I begin to feel guilty for violating the author's right, I will just read an article like this.
In an information economy, copyright violation = theft.
It is the same because they must quote their sources correctly.
Often, obtaining a license costs nothing.
No, it's a violation of copyright.
Not the same thing.
Using content without proper license, you deprive artists of their bread.
You can always debate pessimistic assumptions - but it's a flight.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it won't become as true.
It's a violation of copyright.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I begin to feel guilty for violating the author's right
Obviously, it does not bother you to deprive artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school duties, an almost perfect definition of what should be a reasonable use, then I am happy to deprive them of this fictitious income.
Lesson No. 1 should show how, if children themselves create anything and publish it on their preferred social networks, they leave any intellectual property on the site under the general conditions they have clicked.
Perhaps if they share their mp3 ballads with a friend on the school bus, they should be expelled for violating the law in this way.
Ah, if we could export this resource we regret, the gossip that says everything is wrong....
If it's a P.S. Member who claims it, then we have to believe it.
I have 2 children, and when they are older to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed from here.
France pulls people down by assistants all the time.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy has created.
What draws France to the bottom is speeches like yours.
@gus I've been working in private business ever since.
I have had the chance to have worked in companies run by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I'm paid because I know I don't have the skills to run a company and this choice allows me to pull red balls on the zero patterns I often meet.
At ease in my basketball I share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan in full: he says the terrible truth!
@gus, if we compare with the German companies that French business leaders constantly quote to ask for reforms in France, in Germany companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between large and medium-sized enterprises - What do French employers expect to do?
What is the state holding their hand?
This state that they accuse of imperitence?
@ Jacques L.
Always this anti-business boss couple on your side!
Remember, what did you create as a job, as an added value, to be as hard?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
In fact, France is facing an unresolved problem: the incompetence of French business leaders who are unable to create jobs and who are bubbling and infantry while waiting for the permanent assistance of the State!
That's terrible!
But they have solutions: removal of the Labour Code, employer charges, taxes, work 45h/week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, are reluctant to claim a lower salary than their abolition!
I look forward to seeing all the "negative" comments on this subject.
What is ironic is the way people always complain about First Group.
According to where I'm from, Last wasn't really an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to keep up with the fleet rather than transform themselves.
That doesn't mean that the Scottish railways have not improved since Last took care of them.
But they also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we don't have the power to do this, hello.
I tried to have them recently, but I didn't make it.
But well, the Labour is going to get us nowhere, isn't it?
It's an international subsidiary.
They are already operating trains in Germany.
Nothing prevents people in the United Kingdom from creating a more moral enterprise and from taking part in calls for tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good at managing, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all for the decision to be finally annulled.
And better yet: MTR, a Hong Kong company won the Crossrail operating contract for 8 years.
Well the Labour, as they have repeated it during the referendum campaign, is entirely for sharing and sharing and thinks that workers must all go beyond the borders.
It can therefore be assumed that they will be happy with this decision;)
It may be because the management of the Netherlands is on good tracks while the management of the British is not.
What ScottRail needs is not just a change of ownership but, above all, new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
"He was a fighting girl."
Sir, I hate it, but I really hate this kind of expression.
Assuming that being "beating" is a superior quality to many others, the concern of others, intelligence, listening, for example, being "beating" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: "beating" cancers, which are not less dead, I know palanques.
Getting out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Let's get back to work, too.
I'm not telling you it's the condition to manage, I'm telling you it's AIDE.
There's nothing to do with someone worthy...!
When in the examples of your life, there is only you to judge them.
It's a fresh start.
Insinuating, would it not be only a moment, that we can have the merit of getting out of a disease or that we can deduce from not getting out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that throws away, everywhere, despite the will, despite trust in medicine, you have a vague idea of what C?
On the contrary, it is wise to think that, if, having a strong moral character, it is likely to make it easier to accept and prepare for heavy treatment, to try experimental treatments as this woman has done and not to refuse them with fear.
Someone who's fighting in medicine, it's first and foremost someone who trusts medicine.
But if we prefer to give it back to the "Lord" it's another thing.
Neither with dignity nor with courage.
These considerations are peculiar to moralists.
When you catch a dirt, a real one, you're gonna get rid of yourself to the point of just becoming a zombie.
Personally, I've caught two of them, some salads, some big ones, and if I'm "battu" as these psychologists say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this fight consists only of closing your teeth, suffering from hell and hitting.
I thought the charge against Milosevic had been decided and finalized a decade ago.
I haven't seen that name in the papers since at least that time.
What's going on?
It's an anniversary.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was carried out "fastly" and then rolled under the carpet.
Is this the story we told at the time?
The communist became a nationalist who launched three wars in the Balkans in the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask what we have voluntarily left aside: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legitimized under the WORLD rule of international law?
What country did Serbia attack?
With regard to RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why do you not mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians, then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against the attacks of NATO, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he were to defend him, he would be lowered by the Western compressor roller.
The West used a smoke screen to detach a part of a sovereign State that then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was soon recognized by Western States that then lied at the end of the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now disappeared completely (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, mentioned here, died politically after his first term of office because he could not understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
Finally, the Guardian should not qualify Milosevic as a tyrant (even if we do not like him).
In my knowledge, there is only one method of predicting earthquakes in Greece is approaching, measuring the pesoelectric level in the quartz.
This kind of study is unquestionably useful and thanks for sharing the results.
A hope therefore, but caution is that this water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet called HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light years from Earth in the Cygnus constellation, which would be "the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules", according to a study conducted by Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine of the University of Maryland.
Method to be followed, then.
Like those involving animals that feel a threat to arrive.
Thank you, Professor of Science, for often regulating these experimental advances that are being carried out in the world.
How would animals know (In advance )?
No doubt the perception of other elements whose rate changes in the case of earthquake.
Like the radon, for example.
A gas has an inodorant priority for man but may be detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable for man, but not for the measuring instruments he has.
But we don't have a reliable result on these tracks...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely for a few hours with a earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen an art report telling the battle of two scientific teams, one Californian, the other Japanese, to acknowledge the validity of their work on the sensitivity of animals to the earth's magnetic fields, and especially their change before a seismic.
So, of course, I'm not scientific, but their assumptions convinced me!
Or are we on this research?
Why so much contempt for this track?
We should learn to listen to nature again...
If we look at things calmly and rigorously, we publish it in a serious journal, and nobody despises it.
As soon as we talk about the "signs" given by animals, we meet in the same way: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before a earthquake the red fish turned strangely around.
I don't understand that we can think that Boris would make a good leader for the Conservatives.
He did too much as mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program you can't stop thinking that this man knows nothing about it and that he's always trying to have fun with a joke.
He never answers directly whatever it is.
He also said he agreed with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari asked him what.
He couldn't name a single point.
He made so many promises to be elected mayor and he didn't keep one.
It only underlines how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a piece of shit, right?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in "Have I Got News For You".
Because it's a celebrity and people have been impressed with the worship of celebrities.
The Londoners voted for him, and it will be the same for the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the party's direction, the Tories' popularity rating will crush the ceiling I'm sure of.
May God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but they don't want their prime minister to be one.
That's exactly what we said about Londoners.
He should've brought his friend along, smarter than him.
In many respects, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans had one as President.
The French have been really and always disinterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have been sentenced to read some books (there are some books, including a French and excellent of B.

It is understood that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, Australia, must always be in the background since the Battle of Savo) did not want to return.

More seriously, it seems to me that local communities and public bodies should not, at any rate, devote a lot of our taxes to financing the dreams of some even as nice adventurers as those!
Are there players in the current Serbian training that are of Kosovo origin?
I know that Dusan Bayjevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, once in Youth and now in Fenerbahce, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they're still on the team
It's Bisevac, Lyon's defender, not Bayjevic.
Bajejic was in the middle of the 1970s and 1980s and has led many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is from.
Bajejic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and has played as an attacker in the great team of Velez who, under the protection of legendary Suleman Rebac, completed twice in the second place in the Yugoslav League (and also included points such as Vahid Halilhodzic and the faithful team of Arsène Wenger, Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you, Mole.
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just curiously, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was at Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was linked to Blackburn *frisson*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Counte arrived, then he went to Fener and, as far as I know, he's not the owner.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you're neighbors.
The thing is, the flag of this drone is not the flag of true Albania today.
Apparently it was the flag of the Great Albania, which includes all regions where there is an important Albanian presence.
A bit of excessive nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there was not much damage (I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map, not what is called the Great Albania, but Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give their way to neighbouring countries.
How could we have felt "an explosion of joy" seeing two towers collapse knowing that women, men and undoubtedly children are inside?
How?
What drives me a little bit in this "witness" is that the only fact that I could, is that once, spontaneously rejoice in the horrific death of thousands of people, I see a "border line" personality that all the "witnesses" should be taken with the greatest circumspection.
Without a doubt, in the short time of "joy", no thought will be given to the dead or to the reality of the horror.
We would have just thought, for a moment, that for once Muslims had been able to do truly and apocalyptic harm to the great evil Satan himself.
Make qqch powerful.
Great.
It seems that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims torn by their sense of humiliation.
With witnesses filmed in Palestine.
Classic Bread Freud.
We were a little suspicious.
The West "Christian/White/Gaulois" cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of Muslims when it contemplates general poverty, the social and cultural underdevelopment of the Muslim Arab world today.
I'm talking about the faubourgs of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
The past splendor, certainly magnificent, is not a comfort, on the contrary.
How to get the Muslim world out of this diabolical tone?
Totally in phase, 2 major poisons irrigate the Arab world l: the great conservatism of power in place and the fascinating nihilism.
The common point, the ice of thought and the excommunication (mild or armed) of its critical expression.
What we've understood before should not make Muslims retreat.
It's the only way.
Do you want to read this article?
I suppose it's true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, wet and depressing months that affect the well-being and humour of many people.
Besides, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I'm suffering from it myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for humour and well-being.
The autumn is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
In particular, the campaign is to cut the wind in the fall.
Not as much to cut the breath as the green of summer when everything is alive instead of being at the point of dying.
In Britain, if you're lucky, summer falls one weekend.
We had a great time this year, don't make your grins that rustle.
Not everyone.
I don't get sick in winter.
But now I'm retired and I no longer develop immunity from outside germs, it can change, I guess.
It's not about dying, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful step full of exciting scents, with a febrileity that culminates in festivals such as Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of drowning and full of other wonderful words.
Just don't stop doing things!
Here's my recommendations for the parties for you.
Yes, these dark and gray months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the monitoring of childcare increases , this is the amount charged by the State which derives mainly from decisions 8 to 10 .
However , in relation to the number of households that have seen their tax increase to this extent , it is particularly those of December 4 and 5 that are concerned ( average income ) according to Figure 2 .
The elimination of half of the widows is not at all dealt with in the article, or rather its impact is entirely under assessment: 230M euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painful.
And it's not ready to settle.
Well, we're not on the straw, but dreamers
For once the PS makes a policy rather than left we're not going to cry...
It is clear that those who are among the richest 20% must bear much more than 75% of the tax increase, why not 90%?
Keep doing this and you will encourage these 20% unless you work or leave.
Well, I know it's not politically correct, but I'm saying it anyway.
He lives the Trots and OCIs recycled to the PS: they understand everything.
Adam, you don't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is still the same here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population has 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when he forbids anyone to collect as much as he can.
Beyond a certain limit, money loses all its usefulness.
And once the usefulness of money is exceeded, money serves only to make money, that is to say, to make the most of the misery.
We are among the richest 20%.
There is no doubt that 20 per cent of the homes that work most (and create some of the wealth that is logically redistributiond).
A fair tax must enable these homes to take advantage of some of their efforts.
Or so much lower your arms and live with minimal social conditions, especially if you have social housing.
The Utopia of red Khmer head cutters have lived happily ever after.
I've done two AirBnB in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things we wouldn't have had in a hotel 5 stars and we didn't have to present ourselves to the reception or deal with the least anxiety.
It's enough to go to someone's house, to sleep there, to park behind you, and to split up.
Dorennav will be my first option when I'm on my way.
The logo has changed, people ...
Check your insurance before renting your house.
In most cases you will need a kind of owner insurance.
Make sure to use a service with the good logo!
Ah, 6 o'clock too late.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and highly risky." It's not true.
You just really missed your chance.
According to the link provided in the article:
At its discharge, Airbnb’s response to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
Within 24 hours, after an e-mail to Gawker provided by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locker to change locks, made arrangements for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article quote Teman complaining that he has not received any support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBNB, to receive how to travel
Hi I'm looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I plan to pay an account and a month of rent at once but I'm a little afraid to send £1,600 to a site I've never really heard of.
But where are we going?
"Support the troops," the Bu$herie sang on every tone...
So, guns are harmless.
I am sure this will please families and close to the thousands of dead Kurds in halabja to learn that their parents and friends have done something other than the chemical bombings of Saddam Hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to remain poly).
Furthermore, what would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that chemical weapons discovered almost 20 years later were still usable?
The author's style is not very clear: "in the search for weapons of mass destruction.
We agree.
You think it's time to weaken the army to strengthen education
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: Is it still the time to strengthen education because we are still at war?
Education would already be much strengthened if "they" worked 35 hours instead of 17.
Our teachers are currently winning more than engineers.
And that we don't believe teachers spend 6 o'clock a week preparing their program.
But this is not visible because the National Education has no means of providing an office to college/lycee to its professors, so they're bossing them.
A form of forced telework in sum, except that the employer does not pay the computer, Internet connection, or supplies.
Besides, it's so much board at 5:00 a.m. a week and 4 months of vacation that you can't complete the CAPES of maths, come on, we're waiting for you.
How come you don't want to be surrounded by poorly educated sheep whose parents are harassing you by treating you like a frog?
I believe that the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadites so that the khurde population can expand better.
Where we can see that the Bush administration has absolutely everything to do with it.
My first job as a graduate in London was to win three times and yet it was a job for which a diploma was needed.
A year later, I saw an announcement to be a worker for the London Metro, it was paid £5,000 more a year and we didn't even ask for the patent.
I've never regretted it.
In this regard, don't do it if you don't find a graduate job, try to find something either that pays well or that you like to do.
If I'd stayed in high school, I'd still be paying my student loan.
I don't like business that much, so I hope to end up in the public service or in the university world.
LOL LOL LOL This article is very late!
Exactly, when I got my degree in 2011 there was already a three-year-old backward.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
Getting rid of bisunour strings such as art / letters / theatre / media / philosophy / political sciences, that is, what is called unemployment diplomas.
I have one of these diplomas and I have finished the production director.
It turned out that the important was not the diploma but, as the above article said, a good professional course, starting at school and throughout the university.
Of course the starting salary was lower, but the scales are quickly raised because in the real world what counts are the results more than knowledge.
This debate has been in the course of engineering studies / artistic series for years.
Scientists cannot solve all the problems, it is more important to be able to get out in the morning, to get to work on time and to interact with people in a way that brings results.
Are letters, philosophy and art bisunour wires?
It's ridiculous.
I suppose you're talking about a kind of media study degree or whatever the absconding line where you're going.
Letters, philosophy, political sciences and art are true lines.
We need people who can explain the big questions to the high school, who understand the importance of the foundations of culture, such as literature, art, etc., and who emphasize them.
Wouldn't it be better to be a real territorial policy to disengage Paris and dynamise the rest of France?
Personally, I don't see the inhabitants of the finals of the Essonne and the Val-d'Oise doing 80km back every day on the bike to come work in Paris.
The inhabitants of the intra-muros and the small belt already have many means of transport in common otherwise more practical (metro, bus, tramway).
> Several secure and key-closed parks, as they already exist in the cities of northern Europe, in Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
Good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalized by the 2RM.
Incidentally, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
So much to benefit from their extensive experience in the field.
Well, we haven't found room for a SEUL bike mount device.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë....
Well, that's not all.
When we discuss with pedestrians and other users of transport in common for reasons they do not pedal, it seems to me that the main reasons that come out are: 1/ it is extremely dangerous with all these bicycles, these trucks, these scooters that drive super fast and fail to survive the bikes 2/ we take full pollution into the head For me cyclable tracks are tracks to go, we have to reduce the car traffic (urban congestion charge), reduce speed (Paris = zone 30), comply with the road code by systematically verbalizing the bikes (even bikes near which we have to adjust the code of the written road for bicycles 100 years ago), we have to reduce the speed (Paris = zone 30), keep track of the road by systematically describing the bikes (even bikes near that we have to adjust the code for bicycles written for bicycles), we have to do not pass without scotno and passers.
The cyclable tracks are from apartheid, we need to co-dwell but rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing on the bike in the big Paris?
Not a word about the place of the bike in the public transport?
EELV is right.
The goal of 15% of sailing is ridiculous.
I'm beginning to think Anne Hidalgo rolled the vegetables in the flour.
In addition to what OR reports, EELV members seem sceptical.
I prefer being optimistic.
Before the rocket starts, it would be better to find someone who's really hiding behind this massacre.
Index: it's not Russia.
Not sure how to like the way the world evolves.
That looks terrible.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case to the ECHR, but I did not hear that a complaint had actually been filed.
Moreover, they should first submit complaints in Germany or Ukraine.
I also hope that these cases will be postponed pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the resulting criminal investigation.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 anymore.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault lies with the authority responsible for airspace security, in which case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had been hit previously, Ukraine was launching into the area of air attacks against rebels, and of course any aircraft could be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Did the Ukrainian government take reasonable precautions in view of an obvious threat or have it chosen to play with the lives of the innocent so that air carriers would pay the air traffic rights of the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls that defend their supposing government / the Western Ukrainian ultranationalists - and who want to show in large that Putin hit the MH17 flight.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what is happening in their heavens.
The previous: a 1986 judgment of the International Court of Justice which concluded that the supply of weapons by the CIA to the rebel forces of the Contracts in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia will not allow this case to go to CIJ.
It's funny to think that Abbott means to Putin that Australians were murdered by rebels supported by Russia.
I hope he can present evidence to support his allegations.
So far, the investigators have not said anything like that.
Calling Ricardo and being such an eco-stimulant, it's embarrassing!
Calling Polare is losing the north is a pleasure.
One question is, is today's poorer than yesterday's poorer?
I can't help but notice that the most virulent critics of Picketti's book haven't read it!
It's easy to read, I've spent a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequality-concentration, inequality of labour income, property of capital, merit and inheritance in the term log.
It shows that today's capital concentration goes together with that of the beginning of the 20th century before 1914, shows that it is the 2 world wars that have reduced the concentration of capital from 1914 to 1945, and then how the concentration resumes after...
Bernajuzan: you don't care what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this paper knowing that the concentration capacity of an individual has some limits.
Next, the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is fair or not.
If it is fair, we can discuss it without having read the book whose main purpose is to argue in a unique way in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How much time have you spent reading it?
Is the central thesis of his paper summary is false?
I haven't read it and I won't read it.
So I believe in the summary of his central thesis, and that's the one that seems to me to be just fussy.
The notion of the difference between the rich and the poor is subsidiary.
Has mankind not been fully enriched?
And this wealth added to an increase in the population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the price without a doubt.
But remember, she's only 17 years old.
An age at which most people just start finding their place in the world.
I hope that this price will not be a burden for the young girl and that she will find her way to a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments that want to prove the old adage that the colored perverts are the incarnation of evil.
All my wishes of happiness in Malala, but she must realize that it is being used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - even in the popular neighborhoods of Great Britain!
Someone thought his speech was a little weird.
She thanked her father for giving her much freedom, but mentioned that if she wasn't where she is now, she would have been married at 14 years of age.
Is Malala herself not part of these "colored perverts"?
You should have no "antenna time" on this site.
You're, you're a terrible pervert.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, her father didn't marry her at 14 years of age.
She was 15 years old when she was shot.
His father conducts a school where girls are educated and he is in favour of equality of rights for women.
It is, and has always been, for her to receive higher education and have the right to decide for herself from her marriage.
However, he is an unusual person in Pakistan, as he thinks women are equal to men.
What she said was that an average Pakistani girl often has to marry at 14 years of age, without having her word to say.
I'm sorry she didn't make it out loud enough for you.
This may seem contradictory, but perhaps it means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at 14 years of age
Rather disappointed by this entry in season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who apparently has a little trouble finding her partner character Marlene Dietrich.
I have just looked at the last two seasons that are quite different but I must admit that it is one of the best series of horrors, one of the most accomplished!
A first fascinating episode.
The realization is close to perfection and Jessica Lange's show singing the anachronic Life on Mars de Bowie is simply reverse.
I haven't seen this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story, I'd rather have all of a sudden than watch 13 episodes in 3-4 months.
But one thing is certain, outside Jessica Lange's extraordinary, is the risks of making scenes and mountings that sat me down.
There is an avalanche of original plans in AHS that does not make it ridiculous to accept today's productions.
It saves me a little bit of seeing you throw the sponge ahead for the next season without even waiting for the power to brighten the quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series, but, you say so well, there are many other things.
It's not just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and how she uses it) is really one of the pillars of the series outside the technical qualities.
And good bah I look a lot for her.
Then I find that the series is written, she wants to do too much at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in the 2 it was too scattered despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them making 10 American Horror Story seasons or it'll end up like 24 hours of chronos what.
But everyone does what they want!
It's by what I say "I won't look back" that everyone is forced to do the same!
I just share my view of nothing more, nothing less.
Jessica Lange's loss, I think she'll be dead.
But then, here, it's just my opinion.
Let's talk less about tax increases, please - let's cut the state spending instead.
No, let's increase the expenses, please.
Those who wanted to know about the expenses failed.
Initiate controversy over relatively small expenditure positions, such as development assistance
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the United Kingdom.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than about the change of direction that voters seem to call for their wishes and during all this time some, in each camp, seem to make these nuances much more important and substantial than they are - and voters see clear in their game and find them of bad faith.
Less than 1 per cent of the expenditure.
The "debts" are assets mainly held by financial institutions in that country.
The "debt" is nothing to worry about.
I would not see any problem with the government approaching a third of my income (even before talking about consumer taxes) if I thought it was going to be used in a good way.
But that is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been quite honest about how to reduce taxes but good, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, subsidies to windmills that are almost unnecessary and nuclear power plants that cost twice what they should, you get to a figure that makes the Labour and Lib-Dem tax ridiculous on the most luxurious residences.
Your first £10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns £35,000 per annum will pay about £5,000 (a seventh of their salary), someone with £50,000 would pay about £10,000 (a fifth), etc. and someone with £200,000 will pay about £70,000 (a little more than one third).
What about social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking costs and the car vineyard, and it's before VAT.
Nearly 30% of my money is taken from the source before local taxes and the car vineyard.
I've been paid decently, but not extravagancely.
Not that it is a problem, of course, I am happy to pay my taxes.
But let's not seem to believe that money falls from the sky, or that it's not important to know where billions of tax books go.
How can a unemployed person looking for work at the door to prove it?
However, 20% of the unemployed would not seek it, which means that 80% seek it and do not find it.
Since I'm unemployed myself, am I more interested in what others are looking for or not?
That a potential recruiter receiving 10 or 20 CVs increases my chances.
Actually, I haven't had any news from Pôle Employ for months, which means that the agents are more involved in control operations than actually getting employment announcements back?
I don't see the interest.
Because it is not for the State to provide work.
If Pole Employment does not provide enough jobs, then you must move from Pole Employment.
What is it about a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, so it is clear that the unemployed are well fulfilling their duties in return for their rights.
As a controller requires their transport status to users by means of a means of transport, a service chief or their employees, etc.
Nobody yells at the scandal in these cases, right?
It is indeed good to remember that the unemployed have rights: the only two times when I had a case in Pôle Emploi, my rights to the ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the files, which was amputated by 40%, it was necessary to fight hard.
It's taking time!
I'm not an expert in law.
The fixation and control is currently taking place, while Paul Employment is in fact close to being an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should only concern employees, who pay the costs.
Non-wage French politicians and politicians enjoy rights they do not have!
It's not normal.
I would add that decent unemployment insurance is part of the value of paid work.
More than waiting for Arab killer tweets...
In fact, there must be a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then be similar to the spread of the black plague in 1348/9 in connection with the war and displacement of the population at that time.
The Saudis had the mind to ban Hadj in Mecca this year from the three affected countries.
The country reports that 7,400 have seen their refused visa application due to their country of origin or their recent travel.
In fact, there was the case of a pilgrim who came from Bosnia who hired the variable in Mecca during Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim who came from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same presence of mind.
Is it heartless to propose to prevent Ebola’s patients from taking a plane for Europe?
I thought it was a simple good sense, but apparently those "knowing" decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
These West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be placed in strict quarantine.
No one gets lucky.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they are there, they will stay there until they are cured.
These are not draconian measures.
Just last week, people were contaminated after having had contacts with people in West Africa although they took "all necessary precautions".
We can stop the progression of this disease.
It is mainly promoted by airlines.
Let us ban them from offering to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms, so that they can be placed in quarantine immediately.
That the message of the first individual and of the group (including religious) will be passed and he will have deserved the Nobel Peace.
I doubt that he is able to raise in dogma the image of God characterized by the total cortex of the planet in operation.
It's still far from this concept.
It has only been 20 years since information appeared as mankind's first given, while religion, from the brain, has been guiding our actions since Lucy might have come.
What is the interest of becoming a single Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed it, Catholicism is widely minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would not in any way put their feet in the Church, there is only to see the low number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, we take away the notion of sin, too "anxious"?
@louise: Sorry the church has no limited vision to France.
And in the world, maybe this will allow you to touch more people...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you think existed in Christ.
Hillel said to him a century ago, "Don't do what you don't want us to do, it's all the Torah and the rest is just comment: go and study!"
Christianity goes well beyond a simple reciprocity but introduces the agape.
Your "to advance justice, peace, brotherhood" but without God?
Is that a return to communism? :-)
Next step: Remove incarnation and resurrection.
Jesus will remain this hero who has upset moral laws by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be ready to play their part in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace and brotherhood.
Not very Catholic?
I remember that the low number of Protestants in France is mainly due to the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then converted into force and forced into immigration a few centuries ago.
I hesitate to buy this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game will come soon.
That doesn't make any sense.
I would personally choose SoM.
I like Westeland 2 (I even participated in his fundraiser campaign) but I don't think it's worth £30.
If you are interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM to £30 and also offers a 20% discount bond.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount.
I'll take a look.
Of course not at work.
The delights of the computer department block all nice sites.
Hello, is it £30 and then 20% reduction, or is it that £30 includes 20% reduction?
Attention, however: the PC version is only for DX11.
It surprised me, I bought it, but I can't play it.
Besides, I bought it on Steam, so no refund is zero.
It's time to buy a new video card *make the mouth*
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all that: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon 30 £ for PC, 35 £ for Xbox 360 and PS3, 44 £ for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid one day they're going to make it out of your library if they decide to do anything against the people who buy it while they're out of the planned area.
Join the beta version of Elite: Dangerous.
So was France in 1940 a "purrid land"?
So tell me, this Nobel prize looks like a poisoned gift to me.
Should you love France of 40, that of "the poor stranger"?
When you see who gets the Nobel literature, you wonder if Proust or Dostoïevsky would have it today.
Nobel is not even an event, we don't even want to read the winners.
Will Brazilians, Chinese or Australians read Modiano, who is already difficult to read in French and who describes a universe so limited and so self-centered?
I hope the other Nobelians are more credible, but frankly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso only have a distant relationship with literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel prize?
It'd be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, the Brazilians and others, don't worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture, they.
They will appreciate Mr.
Modiano at its fair value, if they don't know him already!
On your side, continue to attend Lévy and Musso.
I share your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso preserve all their chances.
So let's see who got the Nobel Literature : H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Say hello to the cowards.
Since I drove one in Iceland, I haven't stopped seeing Kia Sports everywhere.
I think this thing has been following me so far.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or do I fall off like Superman III's horrible computer?
Hello Dantra, always hate it?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my doctors.
It's Wednesday!
I've had a few days of rest.
It was cool.
Last weekend I went to Nottingham's beer and cider party.
It was brothel.
I was able to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mixture of people there, there were only CAMRA fans (not to be confused with camera fans).
Driving on Sunday's return was really hard.
On Monday night we went to the grandfather of a pot to play at the nine card brag.
Thanks to a real starter chance, I was able to divide with several decades.
I hope if I get to 95, I'll be as alive as he is.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came up with a piece of mud on it.
I admire M.
Read a little Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That says, without wanting to contradict you, I think you're getting a little away from the subject.
This famous totality, it prohibits searches for djihadists at the exit of mosques.
She's signaling arms trafficking without delay.
Either we have big eyes open like Meddeb and Taia or Boubaker or we have big eyes closed.
We have to choose.
It's not by keeping the eyes closed that we access with the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again, you are making a monumental countersensitivity: all the authorities, organizations or representative associations, whether Muslim or not, having formally condemned the EI and its crimes, French, Muslim or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official condemnations.
Who says no to consent.
The problem is that people like you first see them as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, Mr Mervel, there is doubt for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the approval by the Jewish French of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecencies to accuse them of prioritising them and to demand that they publicly demonstrate to prove to the rest of the French society that it is wrong to doubt them.
This principle is in my view the denial of the Republic and can only help to delve French society.
If there's no doubt about it, just say it.
Who doesn't say consent, but consent to what?
It allows for closeness with EI or with the conviction of EI.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to house the goat and the goat.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically intensible.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could "revenge" the parties represented in Westminster during the elections because a huge meltdown broke between their decentralization proposals and what they promised to watch the referendum on independence.
Cameron must be petrified to lose all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron must laugh.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives are totally fucked up in Scotland because they don't have a seat.
They can do whatever they want in any electoral impunity.
I don't think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that losing his seats in Westminster for the benefit of SNP is a good long-term thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who's gonna cry for the Labour Party.
They will be completely eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP that will cut their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "Promesse" thinking he was saving his party but not realizing that he was signing the death warrant for his Scottish MPs.
Not surprisingly, some Labour Members are asking for accounts from their leader.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from Conservatives, then they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both Conservatives and Labour to do what they have promised for maximum decentralization.
I think it's important rather.
Not if the Labour or Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Cease 8% to 85%, this is not a super electoral strategy.
In addition, once the Scottish Members are no longer able to vote on matters relating to England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with Ulster's unionists and it worked.
However, he is still in high school to be prime minister in 2015 and since he won the management of the Labour Party.
So, in large, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
It is the "Life of the Others" of East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of FRIC...
Always the same fascination for monitoring techniques.
Finally, it will have at least a sterilizing effect.
I'm waiting for the next ticket : Amazon manufactures your book according to your profile and this automatically thanks to an algorithm of your secret!
It's gay like the world.
Very stimulating.
Thank you for the article.
As under this system, DRM management is not implemented, I still read pirated files, public domain books or purchased from a few publishers who have the intelligence to offer files without a fly.
Because of the price I paid Kobo, it's unforgivable.
I am appalled by the generalized abdication of users in view of the generalized appropriation of their private lives.
In your large public library, you will systematically notice that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also demanding bosses whose opening and closing rates are undoubtedly desirable.
For example, James Joyce’s “Finnegans Awake. ”
@Thomas: In the age of Big Data, the data doesn't really need to be personal to be relevant.
Attention not to put all the literature in the same box.
The collection of anonymous data when there is a profile....
The harvest is not anonymous.
It is the data published by Kobo that is, not allowing readers or authors to be identified.
But Kobo's got all this information right, him.
There have been so many exaggerated, misleading and contradictory statements by the Turkish Government in recent days that the country seems to be headed by a mother class full of schizophrenic acid products.
It's even worse than taking Erdogan's religious fundamentalism into account.
It is interesting that some partisans from Erdogan think Islamist is such an insult that they delete your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Well seen:-P But Turkey didn't want to take a ball in the foot unless it won something.
If she attacks ISIS, ISIS will respond, so it's actually pulling a ball in the foot.
A retired diplomat wrote on his blog: "The AP reports that Iran warned the United States that it would be a mistake to try to reverse Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad's law because it would endanger Israel's security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran was sending a serious retaliatory warning or merely advising caution.
This second option is more likely and, in all cases, what is really surprising is that today's Iranian and American diplomatic commitment concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region."
Indian Punchline's reading is highly recommended to anyone who pays attention to the details rather than to the c*neries balanced by traditional media. The short article that you give the link is important and should be read by keeping in mind the realistic comments / previous warnings from Iran proposed by Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980.
Who are these "moderate" who are seriously fighting the terrible lay Assad and at the same time the evils of ISIS?
The policy of pipelines pushes the world towards the abyss, and I would suggest those who refer to "moderate" non-existent ones to pay more attention to the facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in the Third World War.
"It is even worse than taking into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism" Is there any other religious fundamentalists in the Middle East?
I've got a head.
There would be a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Should I?
Do you realize that neither criminals nor victims have the least chance of being alive yet?
A little late for that, my take...
Wouldn't criminals be barely old now, 120-year-old?
A little late for that, isn't it?
Especially with regard to the triumph of the CUP that planned and directed the genocide, Talat and Djemaal killed just after the First World War by revenge by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a pale place in Central Asia near the same time, when there was a dream of establishing a Turkish empire there.
What a deal!
An impressive master of the sophism of the fatal pen, but apart from this, we are looking ill for contact with the real.
That's like no argument.
The fetus will always hear a heart that beats even in the womb of a pregnant mother.
Lesbian couples can simply be a childish desire and not a desire to be accepted.
The heterogeneous couples are also sterile.
About the kids!
What a shame to name them as future psychological imbalances.
One day, they will have the age to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to earn their lives and to pay for this woman's retirement (?)
The GPA is certainly a temporary "solution" in the evolution of the medicine that our world knows.
She doesn't date today.
Many women brought and put into the world children who were not their husbands.
It's still like this. We're done like this.
The important thing in this regard is that this practice is framed so that the "marketing" of the body is limited.
But aesthetic surgery, cosmetics aren't they also body marketing? !
Anakronik Farenheit ...
It is certainly more elegant to make a good one in a faraway country via the internet and Pay Pal than to impose its responsibilities and or avoid the scandal in another century near home without shouting it at this time on all roofs! ...
These practices were no longer done on behalf of the church! ...
There are only Christians and believers who deny these practices ...
There is nothing less than the exploitation of the bodies than a real problem.
Oh, cut it out, this man is passionate about something.
At the end of the 1970s in the Midlands, I've only seen this from a distance.
I had to go there the day because I didn't have the right to go there at night!
But if you like this and you listen to the music - this music today it always touches you so much.
I do not know why there are so many surprising comments here about what Paul Mason said, perhaps they are posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I believe that in the sports section there is an article on the foot waiting for your comments.
Super article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's film, there is a lack of reports that really reflect the reality of North England's culture.
No wonder Paul Mason had a good grasp of the social and political context, he well understood things.
The North Soul still lives, but it has been vampired by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
This says, you can take a look if you're in the London region in November: 99poul will again pass soul vinyls, including Northern soul, on Saturday 15 November at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought "always the same story", but here's a small article well written and well thought.
Your critics really need to be more constructive.
It's a great article.
I loved your documentary.
I suppose you're happy to have escaped from Newsnight.
Last train to Wigan from Victoria/Exchange and get down to Wallgate.
They're chewing pills.
Whatever the station before Wigan was Ince, 15 minutes walk from Wigan after buying a ticket for the stop after Victoria!
The beginnings of the Northern Soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the George Gentle police series, called Gentle Northern Soul, which takes place in Newcastle in 1968.
Things are getting more and more toxic.
Palestinians have no partner in peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahou never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahu does not seek peace because he wants to continue to occupy-colonise (and that was also the case with Rabin).
Clearly, Rabin, Netanyahu and their electors have all preferred the occupation-colonization to peace.
He wore his clothes, put them on the rock and entered the water.
An Israeli had stolen them.
The representative of Israel got angry and said, "What are you talking about?
The Israelites were not even there at the time."
The representative of Palestine (United Nations) said and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian authority and will not diminish the guard ...
That moves the anti-Israelites is evidence, it is not the sought purpose ...
Antisionist: But I answered, I translate: the global geopolitical report ...
And it's always like this since politics is globalized...
Avoid, avoid...
In the Israeli-colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, that is certainly a loss!
For Israel's creation, you don't answer.
What force report has enabled Israel to be created?
Anti-Sionist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still quite a force report today!
You doubt it?!!! ...
Besides, it doesn't just go around Russell Brand, but the Guardian's journalists seem to have trouble going beyond anything he has to say.
Many of what he says are only pseudo-chomskytes written by others.
This is who proves that you don't understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It's just a result of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old girl loves it well, which means it's a matter of immaturity).
A really vicious charge, with just a suspicion of the awareness that Russell Brand tells certain truths, perhaps of the truths that we prefer not to think about.
Hang on, this feeling will be getting more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand Horrible Some: He speaks pretentiously and after all the absurdities of tabloids he actually gives the impression of being a populist beginning, but all this story of not voting has been completely misunderstood by me.
The general consensus seems to be that it just tells people not to vote and rather to cross the arms and ignore the whole political process - but if you look at Paxman's interview and other articles/videos that he has posted, he says that once every 5 years he only vote for the Labour or Conservatives (or Lib Dems I suppose) and limit the democratic commitment to this is completely unnecessary, both parties (at slightly different degrees) ruling mainly in favour of particular interests, multinational companies and rich people, at no time does he just say to completely ignore politics because these parties do not govern in our name: he insists that instead of just voting and disconnecting themselves for five years, many people should become politicians, many people should become politicians, many of whom they want to become involved in politics, many of whom they want to become politicians, many people to join in political movements, many of whom they want to join.
I am not saying that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think that being politically active by submitting his applications can go along with voting, since politicians are giraffes that will change their opinion if they really risk losing the elections), but it's mad to see all these condescending answers that say that this idiot who makes Jesus tell young people not to take the punishment to vote and just hope that everything will go better because it's really deforming his arguments.
Its solution is extremely controversial, and it would be good if people were to discuss what he really said rather than simply label it irresponsible and put aside his concerns and a large number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The item on the vote was completely deformed.
I am deeply angry that my vote has nothing to do with the use of a ballot every five years.
I want more referendums, electronic vote, direct democracy and Members who report locally to their electors.
In addition, I contest the idea that Russell Brand's words are not his (written by others).
It is smart enough to have its own words and ideas, even though they are strongly influenced by the kind of thinkers and anti-establishment universities from the counterculture that Suzanne would like to group under the label "pseudo-chomskytes."
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne does like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even the head bumps cut off at the assembly!
As Max Keiser, who at first attacked Russell but ended up becoming one of his fans and inviting him to his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come from.
It is possible in a political discourse that has existed for generations, but which has been marginalized by traditional media - including the Guardian - for generations.
This "fronde" especially reveals to me that the intellectual debate has long been out of place in the history's RDVs, where trade historians have become minority and where trades of specialists have used themselves to the benefit of ready-to-thinking Condensed Type Sciences Po for press records.
For my part, I had seen in Pierre Bourdieu's intellectual attitude as well as Michel Foucault's, a need to take care of a guilty one, an emissary.
They develop one and the other very rational reasonings, but this rationality is based on these emission beams, which are the key to seeing what they think.
I think, rather, that for Foucault the state was indispensable as a guilty person.
This is a very archaic thought, the sacrificial thought, which is also the magical thought.
The problem of the report to each other is addressed by eliminating it.
There is an anarchy, neo-lib and / or /liberate penthouse (of the two terms the second marks a hardening desire for the eradication of the state , the first one who is going to seek the State's help for its markets ) in the sense of least state / not at all in Foucault .
The old dream of the base that is beautifully organized.
Its thought is built on the guilt of the State: without this guilt it does not stand.
Whoever says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a stand against the three intellectuals quoted here.
Not any other support.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old time, that of his god then, Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you have no doubt read a chouya too quickly if you have taken Foucault's texts on the Iranian revolution for an apology of Khomeiny.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel in this way...
Gauchet puts a deep reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty of the accession mechanism in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree with him or not, it is an original and respectable thinker.
See this horse orchestrated by researchers in human sciences from the hard left who do not support the passage from the legacy to their mantras, it is quite ridiculous.
Narcissism and authoritarianism of these people are unlimited.
An important point to add seems to me to be the posture of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of Chinese and other "yellows" I have witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't have the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends about this then.
And where was it in Russia that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember seeing a Chinese for the last time.
In London and they were nice to me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s the last time, in a market.
The Chinese think so of the Whites!
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them have violent anti-Blanc talk.
My father's not happy that his old girl was dating a White.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s, and especially in recent years: they are becoming richer, prosperity spreads outside the big cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
What I have been told is that the Russians have mainly prejudiced against temporary workers without qualifications from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in occupations and areas where they are very likely to be exploited by their employers or faced with high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Ienesi River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I have heard the views of Australians about Chinese and Aboriginal people.
It's really weird that a stranger tells me that I don't support the Chinese, while I've met two of them in my life (from one to the other), I haven't kept bad memories of them, all people are getting used to it, and actually those in London have been very kind, that's the only reason why I've remembered that they were Chinese.
Otherwise, we don't remember who we meet, all people are brave, how to remember who it was.
Do you know what's weird?
That you and the other Russians here speak Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with that white guy.
How many Chinese men are with Blanches, by comparison?
No, because there are many chances that the parents of these Whites would assault them PHYSICALly.
No measure of the impartiality of justice.
However, it is the mother of all battles and justice in France that remains manipulated by groups strongly marked to the left as the union of the judiciary...
@Marabout: I'm sorry, but the judicial environment is frankly marked right.
When he is in the Judicial Union, he represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of partisanity can be taken on the basis of the relativity of the application of the laws in courts, it shall order two obstacles to be removed.
The political vision of the observer as that of the actual interpretation of the magistrate.
It remains the law's mandatory tool to refocus the assessment on the basis.
The measure of its non-compliance in all judicial acts of magistrates, including prosecutors, requires a distinction between the error and the bias of the magistrates.
It would be foolish to claim that acts of justice do not divide between these three groups.
Claims and ignorance are not part of an objective analysis.
And if all this has not been analysed, then how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If it is only by statistics that implicitly reveal that it is very low.
The previous preamble enables the following to be included in the third ratio.
The corruption* of the judiciary.
A sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nuisance* which is conferred on the judicial institution capable of such a heresy.
The area in question is that of spoiling* of heirs committed to the process by successor genealogists sent by notaries.
This profession is well received every year while receiving the coverage* provided by the almost judicial impunity* of the French notary.
For their understanding of the mechanism, a part of it was reported in comments following the first publication.
Where this is accompanied by the statistical improvement* moderated by the previous commentary, the judicial institution has produced, in many disputes between the genealogicalist and the retaliatory heirs, a whole set of case-laws contrary to all the laws that favour the heirs.
Is not the presentation of European statistics ignoring this kind of rational criteria a form of lying?
Prices are certainly totally prohibitive.
More of the equipment to help the disabled.
That's what we can say, but my brother has one of these tricycles all over the country, built in size and weight, and it really allowed him to enjoy the full air as never a normal wheelchair, with wheels and tires covered, could not.
As we say, tastes and colors...
The Tankchairi looks like Jeremy Clarkson could make up for a challenge in Top Gear.
The Tankchair looks like EPIQUE.
I think the inventor of the Will never had to clean a dog's crotch on a cane.
I'm sure my sister would love the tricycle all over the place, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra-long distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a pen for the longboard.
Here are some hills that they would like.
Prices seem really high, but there are really people who put this kind of price in a bike, so "you see".
The tricycle of all the land seems particularly useful to me.
Not all people with disabilities are poor, however.
Many of them have a reasonable amount of insurance at their disposal.
Only if they have become disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things they know we need.
We can't really say that Wheel is a minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately it's just a draft, it's not meant to be made.
I am glad that the "long distance" wheelchair does not reach the market, because there seems to be no way to drive this thing.
Nearly 20,000 homes were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza, during intense bombings of densely populated residential areas.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli bloc in Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under 18 years of age.
Eight-year-olds have lived their entire lives under Israeli blockade!
A unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation, an illegal situation as well, as this block inflicts a "collective penalty" on all Gazan civilians.
" Entrepreneurs who work on their projects turn a little bit of their cement into the black market " ...
Ah, that's not the wooden tongue, but concrete and armed the lady...
The references are here to support an argument or a fact.
Antisionist...
The good cement goes into the tunnels!
The black market is certain, and recognised.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
A unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation for anyone who has a heart and a moral sense.
The United States has a well-kept land: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi didn't have the time to rule because the dictatorship (supported by what you know) excluded it!
Also remember that after lifting him, Morsi had restored the block!!!
And I'm a Western, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The Blocus is an Israeli-Egyptian ...
The children of Gaza live on a underground fortress, built around the people who chose their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Alex.
I hope you've thought it through.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
It is the very definition of the sharing economy, without any profit.
Many are only looking for one night on Couchsurfing.
So it is to be paid (or at least expected) in another way.
It is always much less expensive than a hotel, if you need to find the right addresses.
In addition, owners and tenants who are trusted often stop using Airbnb and deal directly with cash, thus bypassing Airbnb.
Where's the community in all this.
"What does she rent on" ?
No problem with the verb, what's the problem with your grammar?
The word "to letter" is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international journal now, in case you hadn't noticed.
It would be better to have good insurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% compliant with all the security rules and ask those who manage channels and rivers to allow it to carry out a commercial activity (which they will definitely refuse). I have a boat and I have tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, In short, it is really a nightmare...
Have you thought that boats can be moved, stolen and repatriated, rolled, etc.?
The penises are so slow that if someone tried to steal it, it would always be near where you left it.
Or distracted by pirates...
All these Somali immigrants who come here and attack our penises...
Where are you going to make him bitter?
No, Marine Le Pen is wrong!
Populism?
There is no truth but the one who exposes the facts!
Poverty increases in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase in wealth among the wealthiest hands is a reality.
Who's defending who?
Who's defending what?
In 2017 the Mass will be said!
Capitalism won't get away with it!
The high finance, speculation, plays with our businesses, our jobs, our raw materials, so our purchases, our food, our health care structures, our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and by our money they hold..
All this for the benefit of some hyper-mega-obese of the fear.
To the contrary, FH said: "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy, it is finance."
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed a former economic minister of Rothschild Bank, a story to better defend the interests of the bankers, only responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there anyone else in charge?
You call this how: to return his dress, to kiss his pants?
Primary and populist response
Actually, we don't know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where'd you see this?
Because the Germans refused to help the survivors.
I'm not sure Spee really "refused" to help the survivors.
One aspect of this battle was that none of the parties seemed certain of the exact force of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book "Castles of Steel" suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British cook in the area.
The sea was stormy at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the battle ended after the sun had gone down, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this to the next battle, that of the Malouines, where, on the photos showing survivors while being rescued, we see a calm and full day sea.
In addition, the rescuers knew there were no more German fighters in the area at this stage.
Hmm, that doesn't really correspond to what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipedia:
"There was some confusion among the German ships about the fate of the two cruisers who had disappeared in the dark after they had stopped shooting, and a race started.
Leipzig lives in a fire, but as he approaches it, he sees that it was only a sword.
Nürnberg, slower than the other German ships, joins the battle late and lives the Monmouth, weighed and severely damaged but still in motion.
After pointing out its projectors on the ship's flag, the proposal to go was rejected and it opened the fire, eventually rolling the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee judged that Good Hope should have escaped and stopped research at 2215 hours.
Concerned about reports indicating a British cook in the vicinity, he headed north. ”
So, if this is true, the Germans, in the darkness before the invention of the radar, did not know that a ship had flown, and could not therefore seek survivors.
They also thought that there was a more important cousin of the Royal Navy in the area that could have seriously damaged them, so in confusion they were evaporating to enjoy their advancement.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should break a path through many ships of the Royal Navy.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them harm and had cost them about half their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
Several votes are taken to the UMP to request that it be included in the law that a definitively condemned election be therefore definitively ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also touch left electors well on.
But noon, it's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEA I PROPOSED A MESSAGE INCRIPTION TO THE MASTERS
When is the prohibition of trade unions in already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens tolerate?
Stayed by politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, they are always quick to adjust those themselves who will benefit from their inaccessibility to prevent the actions of true policies, which are really trying to make things move, not the beautiful talkable ones whose realism is as far as they are concerned.
I met them in the subway to noon with their little banners "of the courts" they came from province and did not make the difference between Bercy and POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized unions whose members place enormous power on the part of their party.
It would not defend the same thesis if right-wing, or extreme-right unions designated the personalities of its board for a target and led to a legal-media war against them.
Your statements are absolutely free.
If, at present, the court is defamating the judicial news, it is simply that it has committed the facts!
There is no example of left personality that has had so much to do with Justice, but all those who have paid attention have not had favor treatment.
On the other hand, it must be remembered that the union of the left-wing judiciary is not the only union of magistrates and that it is minority.
That a minister supports the unions with so much commitment shows how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you're quoting may be minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great in the Chancellorry, it's not a secret.
The question now arises whether the "mission" of certain judges is not more going out than instructing.
@ gus - You should be satisfied, the SM is minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: You forget that magistrates are not officials like others: they are the only ones who have the power to accuse and incarcerate everyone.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I believe that even the weakest fading of glory realizes that X-factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised that someone accepts their offer.
Many have used it as a springboard to start a successful career.
The One Directorate fills the stages of the world.
Others then sold a lot of disks or left for West End.
Popstars, the precursor of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who is actually a member of the jury.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all won the Eurovision competition, as well as others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and everything else participated in competitions in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the British television light entertainment stars.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that is what happens anyway to most of the stars who do not participate in the competition.
Rarely are those who, after a tube, manage to do it to others.
In any case, most singers / groups can best expect three albums and one best of them.
Yes, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, has only fans in the United Kingdom.
His celebrity comes partly from his marriage with a football player who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it is more likely to find out about a career than the typical walk of the rock, although in your dreams you think that all guitarists who smoke from the grass in their father's garage and balance three agreements on a poem primary school level will certainly become stars and that the only question is how much they want to touch even before going out an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied – a distance that quickly turns to racism, because the religious ethnologists present these distant people as infinitely superstitious and petris of ritual bigotry, while most of their ways are strictly equivalent to our and inspired, like ours, practical considerations daily.
Unless you imprudently interpret in the opposite direction.
But rather than saying that the drum is devoid of a sacred character, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and our Molières also have a somewhat sacred character?
Our way is like being reminded to see the sacred as a kind of well-defined object and circumscribed to the religious sphere.
Article very interesting whatever it is.
It's from the Ephemer deco to furniture the void.
Nothing more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrative figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacred still lives.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would throw at the oracles of the interpretations of any scientist who lives a mandarin, rarely less.
When does a review of the disciplines for a bit of a rhyming?
Because what is true for archaeology is also true for the interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a dose of healthy modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is entirely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that we constantly discover treasures, valuable testimonies to reconstruct history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very old and before the archaeologists relied on their "instinct" and their knowledge, and could be deceived.
Today there are so many technical and scientific means so effective that the interpretation of the excavations is better but can always be challenged by other discoveries!
We are here in full (and old) controversy about the chamanism advanced by prehistoric Jean Clottes (cf. his book "Les chamanes de la prehistoire", especially the increased re-edition of the scientific controversy, published by the editions La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this highly instructive article
Do straight men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could put myself in.
So it's over with us?
I don't really understand why we can't go on to three?
This journal is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the cadre?
No, but we're not against a theater room above.
We couldn't watch a musical comedy over there on the other hand, that would be too gay!
We could expect to have this kind of comment from you.
We'd say Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost finished, can I suggest you move on to the Catholic Times?
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers Mikedow.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays real journalists, brave, to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their risks and dangers.
Instead of making fun of these dusty ass jokes.
Not very clever.
Go on then.
If these "puerile ass jokes" shock you so much, you're not obliged to participate, are you?
Do you also know that this journal also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is it the subject that shocks you, or is it the fact that people do it?
However, you can see the video amateur crash on the net...
online crash amateur video... ??
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images it is only to protect its interests in any case the pilot's.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the pilots, it would have left safety because at the moment or another vehicle (for example, a van) entered the circuit.
But it had to end quickly before the typhoon that was known to be coming, but for which the FOM did not think it was good to advance the time of departure (television, pub, money...).
But besides, they protect the pilots well.
Well, I also share this opinion.
But there is also that if the very British FOM enters the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance at restarting the English that then led...
You're on this blog, my dear Dayrton.
But it's not serious, I've got a little time to get through all of your fucking jokes.
No, just not.
There was a lot of conspiracy in F1, but never one that put commissioners at risk of death for a distant history of a pilot's chance of victory at the expense of another.
It's not the FOM that gets the security because it's the FIA.
Size nut.
In view of amateur images, the lack of imagery enables the FIA to avoid the ghastly questions of the type: How does the Commissioner act a green flag in full intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see full video after the accident)
No, it's not because the video is considered too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident but because one of the commissioners clearly acts a green flag, signifies that the race can normally resume and that one is more under the yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a dark mecony of the F1.
Yes, dear Etienne, the race is no longer under the yellow flag regime APRES the place of the accident, from which the green flag is agitated.
It's the usual procedure.
The position of commissioners just below the accident (as the case may be, it can be 10 metres as well as 100 metres after the accident) shakes the green to tell the pilots to resume a normal time.
Sensationalism makes the public sell.
I used to think that the media was an integral part of the government's "patriotic" propaganda offensive, but I'm very afraid it's just for money at the end of the day.
And sex, let's not forget sex, fear of not having sex life, the pub and the media are good to sell us things that are supposed to improve our sexual life.
The information does exactly the same thing.
Making a buzz with information that we really don't need to worry about is just to keep making people afraid to continue to control them.
"When the tabloids touch about Ebola, we all catch fear" It should be "dreaming", not "dreaming".
Given the medical reference, "tosser" is much better said in this context than "tosser".
I wonder if all those who are concerned that Ebola could become propagated by air find that they now believe in evolution?
You're doing them too much honor.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the approaching apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You confuse Ebola and Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that ridicules this pseudo-journalism very beautifully and firmly.
It made me feel good.
It saddens me that the media are talking about most things with this optimism on the other hand.
The aim is once again to keep us sufficiently frowned and anxious (without getting to the hysteria) so that the government can let us down when it needs it.
I think it is perfectly logical that if we have to face a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from the crises that he himself invented.
Is there anything fundamentally problematic about the idea of ruling in fear?
Congratulations for this post, and to be still of this world almost 35 years later.
In addition to the beginning this must have been horrible , given the context of the 1980s-90s.
I'm bluffing, living with certainty for years..
Perfectly useless testimony.
As always when we talk about science.
Not only do the testimonies serve nothing: they are taken alone, they cannot serve as scientific material.
But they have a negative influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
@traffic: The testimonies cannot serve as scientific material.
This may be why we refrain from asking questions to patients in psychiatric care when we have reliable observations from close relatives.
My psychiatric record says my psychiatric mother explains that I was taught telepathically by her grandmother.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say it's fucking, it's a subjective testimony.
Ah, because the certification of a fact (= here this testimony, which attests to the pollution and effectiveness of new treatments) serves nothing in a scientific process?
So, what's your research based on?
On ghosts?
Do you set the same level of fantasy theories and facts (= giving rise to verifiable evidence) ?
"Resilience": the word "bidon adjudicated by the grandparents, fans of J-L Delarue, who consider themselves great psychologists after reading D'embourg.
@Jim: There are many empty buzzwords of meaning in the Psys.
Cyrulnik has struck us with the "resistance".
As a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he will have bricoled us a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could save us all from Farage and company?
Doesn't that make you think of Team America?
Seriously, it's not a good idea to highlight the Sentinels of the Air...
So why?
It was a great series and it would be said that those who come out of it are aware of it!
Let us therefore leave our salvation to the Almighty who can do miracles.
But how are they going to get the kids to hang?
The only solution that comes to my mind is the humour kind of pipi-caca, which would kill the series.
It was already a series for children.
The kids hung up.
Ah, because it's a series for kids?
The UKIP is working for the Mysterons.
So keep your team in America.
Always in Supermarionation?
It won't be the same if you don't see the sons and that animation is well done. :-)
I look forward to seeing this (although an adult), but I hope it will give an idea to a chain of redistribution of the old.
The series has almost never ceased to be broadcast here in Australia; it has been at least 40 years with episodes of one hour Saturday and Sunday at 06.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-order commercial channels and can always be seen at these times.
And in addition, half an hour's episodes are now over at 5:30 p.m. from Monday to Friday!
Okay, I'm probably a 60-year-old sad guy, but I don't watch this show every day!
There is no "Mont du temple" in or under the mosque of the Esplanades!!!
The radical Zionists have invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Furthermore, all Israeli excavations below and around the expansive mosque for decades have not allowed anything to be found.
The mountain of the temple if it exists it is elsewhere.
Could it be in Argentina?
This mountain is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the mosque splendour was built.
Its summit, or the Rocher dome, is sailing in the middle of Omar's mosque.
For Muslims, Muhammad is built in Paradise from this rock.
For the Jews, it is Mount Moriah where Abraham failed to sacrifice his son Isaac.
Since it was taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also counts its extremists, it is good to remember him regularly, and they are unfortunately related to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahou, the latter had accepted the plan to 2 states, and had constantly tasted it!).
It is also good to show how far the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact.
Will God be able to recognize his own?
The shortest of Jewish jokes: "Let God be praised!"
In order to glorify tourism in Israel, we often see young Naïves on the beach, half dressed.
The reality is, as usual, very different from what advertising shows us, as can be seen in the photo that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary anyway.
And this photo is a wonderful advertising work!
It's a pity that the photographer of Reuters did not take pictures of hundreds of Palestinians allowed to enter the Temple Mount and preferring to lure the faithful Jews into contrabas, praying to the wall of mourning.
@Mat, If this photo bothers you, it's right, it's not the newspaper, it's not the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she's transmitting that she has to condemn.
This system is unstable and will end in tears.
The only way to put an end to this system is to revolution.
Since the economy seems to be running out of business, large companies have benefited greatly from their employees.
They were able to convince their employees that they had the chance to have a job and that they could not afford to increase their salaries, while at the same time and without hiding, they gave ever more important rewards to the small elite at the summit.
You are right, it is not tenacious, but it will only change in this country when workers really speak of one vote.
Instead of laughing and grumbling when someone else makes the strike, support them, show some solidarity and understand that their strike not only concerns their problems, but also shows your employer that they do not interfere with people.
Unless we abandon democracy, in which case, it's tenacious.
I totally agree.
The only thing you've forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
Like China and India.
All this can't end well.
That's because we're in democracy.
Did you vote for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Partnership for Trade and Investment (PTCI) aims to increase the profits of companies held by these people by short-circuiting national governments by secret courts.
This seems incredible, but this is exactly what the agreement proposed for the dispute settlement mechanism between investors and States (ISDS).
The Greens are against this project and try to warn people about the unimaginable damage this agreement will have to our lives.
It is only recently that we start talking about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you will understand what is being negotiated in your back.
Didn't Churchill say "blood, sweat and tears"?
These are the ones who make excellent results, while the digital money has no reason to fall and even less to push on the trees.
The next low e-mail will undoubtedly be the car market.
This gentleman was right, in XVIII there were unions in all the regiments
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let it (finally, its officers, the others, no one knows anything) believe the safe of the eternal values of France, and it will fight and close its mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the value crisis, in short: the dissolution of the nation's idea, having this little remnant, is comforting.
Even for her, it's getting more and more uncomfortable...
You still miss the union of married men, singles, married women, singles, lost dogs, and I don't know what else
If you don't write the French correctly, I'm in a union.
You've been warned, it'll be your fault.
For the defence of categorical interests, the protection professions with trade unions have already suffered enough, which has created a breach of equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh about the fear of the risk on the part of a civil servant.
We can imagine a system that ensures freedom of expression without trade unions, or then without the right to strike as in Germany, in exchange for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise, it's a disaster.
And with the caravans that are preparing, the government welcomes it.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
I ignored Sybille's ignorance I was allusioning to the military and other officials, as this is the subject here...
delete "through his delegates" in Article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
It will become: "8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions and in business management."
This is absolutely essential with the invasion of the information power.
And yet you have probably opened and commented on an article specifically entitled "The Great British Bake Off review."?????
Wait, the section was there, all empty.
I thought we should start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's wedding I've been looking at, and I can tell you that some have been murdered well.
In the episode of Joffrey's marriage, we have one of the best moments (which is a trick: it was wine) in the history of television.
Also, from the tart mmmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time that the show ends with a victory of the worst bubble; no one has made the kind of "boum, here's my fucking cake now buff it and bow before your master"!
Perhaps the additional pressure from friends and parents outside has finally had an effect on them?
In the previous weeks, all those outside persons were kept away.
And there's also this idea of "playing security, there's always next week" that disappears last week.
I like cooking, but I don't think I'm gonna get into it.
I am grateful to those who do so and thus offer us great fun and motivate us to try new things.
Go ahead for GBBO 2015!
I agree, the last challenge last year, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually spend days doing them, and they had to shave one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really difficult to separate, I don't know how they could choose a winner.
In Luis, the only real flaw they could have found was the base a little dry (even though I agree with Hollywood to say that the green ice on Richard's mill did not want, in any way Richard had already lost at that time).
I have to admit that several of the challenges of this series seem a little artificial because of the time given.
There is also the cancer that looks at, with the beats of the sun.
Definitely, we're all succeeding right now.
A bad time for humanity, we hope.
You confuse the solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UV is mainly blocked by the ozone layer, which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UV.
So even if the magnetic field weakens, there would not be enough solar wind to "smooth" the ozone of the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and thus less UV and "cancers".
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UV.
They have a lot of useful functions you don't suspect.
If we limit ourselves to man they are interested in allowing us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), to warm us (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and seem to improve our morals.
The ozone layer blocks cancerous UVCs and allows UVAs and most UVBs to pass.
Do you know that you are not obliged to be condescending and to view your interlocutor as a stay when posting a comment?
Especially for a minor precision that was understood in the commentary, which itself intends to prove pedagogy.
Without saying I'm a melanoma habit, UV only makes its development ACCELER.
They're not provocative.
For proof: all bronzed persons do not necessarily have melanomas.
So when a tube tells you to avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cave, it is better not to listen because UVs are necessary for all humans.
The excess, on the other hand, is like everything: he kills.
But for other reasons.
UV directly provokes melanoma.
Can we fold it?
And, more importantly, can we pass it on to the mixer?
Or turn it over to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those interested in it have found that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied and the strength of iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the use it is intended for.
I think the army would need something more resistant and therefore has not yet adopted iPhone6 as a first-line communication material.
But for the rest of us,
It's still a good choice.
the majority of those interested in it have found that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied
Except for Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it already folded?
This is a joke in every discussion.
I decided to count them.
That's the fourth joke about the fold I've read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before you install specific software, you can imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production chain and you don't see how it could get back there.
So, hmm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm...................................................
Most likely this is a production unit on which the iOS has not been properly installed and is therefore connected to the installed factory test code.
I don't know how they do these things.
But would they put test software on everyone?
Ebay photographs clearly show the absence of a FCC logo or EC logo and the presence of a prototype red connector.
Ah the article for bobo by excellence.
We want low-priced products and we are surprised that industrials produce in "industrial" We put forward super u but all the teaching and even small trade are concerned How to buffer good, bio avac 1650€ (average wage in France)?
But to answer your post, if it's possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After everyone is free to place their priorities where they hear it.
For my part, the food is one.
Come on, don't worry. I'll kiss you.
It is called bobos, or rather boboecolos, people who see the world through an ideological "software" that leads them to disconnect reality.
It's the total degrouping of reason.
They are gesticulating experts, for example they claim to save the planet because they have avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in truffle, joining the left-caviar, which they sometimes come out, for example by condemning CO2 emissions while spending their vacations in Maldives.
The vast majority of our citizens do not support this mixture of heavy ideology and trufflerism, nor are you surprised to find frequent criticisms about them.
Wow, thank you for this complete and complete theorization as well as for all the associated details (plane, shower...).
I'd like to be a part of it, but I don't find it.
The concept is not so complicated.
Boboecolos are monobloc.
Did you understand the concept of the left-hand caviar?
And well, you're able to understand the concept of boboecolo.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
Classification would be more complicated if we were interested in short schools.
The boboecolo in part but only represents the most visible barrier of the schools because it is the one that infects the media.
Here's a nice giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look at this giraffe in the face.
It's so bad that it looks vaguely like a female nude.
Chut, you're next to the plate.
It is necessary to be part of the microcosm of art to understand the amazing beauty of the truth of this work.
But you simply don't have any legitimacy to make a comment as you haven't spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not that Emin does not know how to draw and always seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous by not having any artistic abilities.
That's art.
No, it's coconut.
The fact that Emin can't draw
That's not really an obvious fact.
This is rather an opinion.
Unless the only thing you could appreciate are real dog reproductions that smoke at the billiard.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in this case.
Drawing is much more than just representing the reality.
If you're not looking for that, a camera will do the job.
The author also speaks of Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image talk about itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
Savings are still needed: horse riding activities, the number of horses in the Republican Guard or the status of generals who are no longer in active service....
Honesty requires France to reduce its staff, but as has been done by all countries, sometimes even more drasticly, to start with Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
Operational without support, it quickly finds its limits!
A unique approach, at a time when we observe weaknesses, the shortcomings of our defense tool, especially in the Sahel.
A bad blow to the local communities concerned, which loses a dimension of their activities, or a part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuary?
@edmond: That's right what I was saying, look at where to make savings, but especially not at my place, it's really not possible at my place...
That's exactly what you're proposing to do, look where the gaggie is.
Let all those who have sided the military little or little dare come here to say, the eyes in the eyes that there is no wasted money in this perimeter and this without bursting to laugh...
Applying the same potion to the entire public service and public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: really praise: look at the inflation of public jobs in other departments and you will understand why the Defence can be a little busy!
Well, yeah, the economies that everybody agrees to say they need to be done, but it's got to be somewhere, isn't it?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls groan at the murder when it comes to them, the poor dear.
This should be done, but especially if I don't think it's a crime and not an economy.
Gugnols, come on!
What close the Val de Grace will weaken our defense tool in the Sahel?
With regard to local communities, the story repeats itself at every closing of the post, maternity, hospital, barracks.
But everyone is for the economies of course.
It is strange, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and does not enjoy the savings made in public spending.
This article is really the most fun thing I've ever read!
This embarrassing moment where the first three people who are commenting are doing the same bad joke.
It is the depression of showing his Facebook line and seeing that 80% of his friends started their status by the phrase "This Disturbing Time".
I think they're gonna make a movie.
It will certainly be based on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex in the bus by going to work and realize only that his shoe has entered his lap.
It's not embarrassing, it's totally con.
Not really, I believe the author adopts the role of the typical British man to whom we have always learned how to get his emotions and close his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a Kate Bush fan, the announcement of his return on stage after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to know who will have the rights?
I don't have the Internet.
So I don't think I can comment.
They don't have a computer.
Oh, my God, I need to watch this movie before I die!
I can't believe how much this article is the most incredible thing I've ever read!
Charlie has really just shown that he is at the top of the cosmic universe that is satirical journalism!
I'm falling back!
I absolutely have to share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so they can finally have the lighting and discover the incredible lightning and the incredible genius that was echoing from Mr. Brooker's keyboard as a divine light.
Oh, my God, it was really zero.
Especially if it's not women or transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive trend in democracy: the build-up of regional policies and effective associative initiatives.
Until the new order we seize the right to save our planet by States that play truffles at each meeting to save the planet.
We therefore decide, citizens, to take matters into our own hands.
With the Commissioner that they planted in the energy, all these beautiful recommendations took place.
Translate: Solar windmills and farms are the Round points of tomorrow.
All funded by the co-tribal.
Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful at the level of its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the wire is not fully controlled, it is better to limit it to laboratories.
The renewable energies are our only salvation, provided that our consumption is drastically reduced.
The electricity from renewables to fight CO2 emissions?
France has nothing to do with this.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions to production and epsilon for the other stages.
Electricity from renewable wind or PV is already more GES on the other steps and above all gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate for the intermitence.
Substituting the nuclear fuel with the revolving wind or PV would be countering the fight against CO2.
Christian I am not insulting you I am the Doctor of State in Physical Sciences 1981 more I have done research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove the contrary of what I said.
For what I didn't say is that you're the one who lend me ideas I didn't say anything about Germany anything you didn't actually answer to what I said and how all the right people to demolish the interlocutor I never do.
I also quote the conclusion of experts mandated by the German Government: Germany's current renewable energy programme is an inefficient and inefficient way to reduce GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emissions if you don't have the uranium extraction and construction and if you don't have the greenhouse gas vapour less effective than the CO2 it really remembers two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant part of the water vapour and a little in the water of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you spoke of Pakistan as a "giant of South Asia" ...!!
Last time, Pakistan won against India.
I am not surprised, most Indians who post comments want to read and comment only on articles against Pakistan.
In fact, it well shows your mental state.
It would have been the same if they had qualified South Asia giant India...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players are participating, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply be to open a Pandore box full of corruption and mafiaosis.
With regard to ISL, today's opening game has been surprisingly interesting, the Kolkata Athletico insisting on 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a lot to do.
Compared to the billions and billions that India devotes to the IPL cricket and now to football, how could we ever compete with our "roaring neighbors"...
The low cost launcher race pays cash.
Damage for such a nice project.
For the incident, the possible lack of design is manifested only with a helium too cold.
So maybe we're not in a design flaw, but we're implementing...
contrary to aranean space which is a private society, it seems well that soyuz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as the state here is its own insurer..
Maybe they'll pay the satellites in frigates who knows.
This is so much easier that many media take up the title of articles in turn - and that many readers only hold on to these titles.
In total, this creates a wrong impression against the content of the article itself.
In fact, with you, the title is not appropriate, it is unfairly challenging the project, whereas it is only a launcher problem.
