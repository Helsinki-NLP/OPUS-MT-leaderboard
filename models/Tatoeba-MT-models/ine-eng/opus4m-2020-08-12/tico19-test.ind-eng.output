How long have these symptoms been going on?
And all chest nerves must be handled in this way especially at your age
And with fever
and blood pressure and cholesterol you also need to be checked
And are you breathing now?
And do you feel the nerves of this chest now?
And do you also have difficulty breathing?
And can you tell me the other symptoms you've experienced with these symptoms?
And have you ever reached how high your fever?
And I'm sick too.
And I'm a little bit of a pussy and a kiss.
And I feel the pain of the chest today.
And this is Rhinitis allergy season
And feel the nerves of your teeth
And I think I also have a little fever.
And I want you to explain where your chest nerves are.
And they're still.
And with your diabetes history
And do you know, my chest feels like it's going to collapse?
And you know, people are always staring at me.
And you feel the nerds of your chest
and you say that there's pressure in your chest
Anyone in the family with heart problems, heart disease, heart attack, high cholesterol, high blood pressure
Is there any symptoms or other problems that you notice together with your muscles?
Is there anyone else sick like you at home with the same symptoms?
Do you feel any other symptoms?
Have you ever felt breathless?
Do you still feel chest pain?
Because it's flu season
But neither can we be sidetracked by the evil thoughts of the heart.
But the more important problem now is this brain nebula.
And I feel a hard time breathing.
But I know a lot of people are staring at me.
But we need to take every concussion very seriously
But now you can breathe well?
I really forgot the cause of this brain damage.
Does it feel like there's someone who's taking your chest?
Still feeling like a little breath.
Do they complain about the same symptoms?
Do you have chronic problems like high blood pressure or something?
Do you have medical problems or other chronic diseases such as diabetes?
Do you feel breathless together with those nipples?
Are you suffering from high blood pressure?
Do you feel like you're breathing with those symptoms?
Do you know what the symptoms are?
Did you see the picture?
Drink a lot of water today
but I did the diabetes test
but he has some kind of symptoms like me.
How high is your fever?
How's your blood pressure?
if your fever continues
if your fever is two hundred or more
if you think you have symptoms or problems you need to check better
I had a fever yesterday.
I also have a little fever
I had a fever yesterday.
I feel like I'm stuck here, in my chest.
I'm also having trouble breathing.
I'll send the picture to you
I'm feeling chest pain today.
I just feel a little headache and fever today
In my opinion, it's flu
I think it's a little flu
Does it feel like there's someone very heavy sitting in your chest?
All begin with headaches accompanied by fevers at almost simultaneously
I feel sick in the middle of my chest
the pressure like the chest nerve
in my chest
in the middle of my chest
in the middle of the chest
I've had a baby in my chest.
I'm very worried about the nipples of this chest.
I want you to explain this chest nerve
like high blood pressure or diabetes
Like right in the middle of your chest.
for the fever, you can drink tachipirin sweet
Mary, how many days have you had these symptoms?
You're saying that you feel the chest pain
Sometimes I feel like I'm breast-feeding.
Well, is there any other symptom with this symptom other than the sense of nerve?
or someone sitting in your chest?
Almost equal to fever, hives, headaches, and muscle necrosis
right in the middle of my chest
show in this picture where you feel sick
Because you're a fever
So, do you think some of these symptoms might be related to pregnancy?
So, your children have some of the same symptoms?
tell me about your chest nerve
fever increased in the night
My fever has been going on for two days
The fever started to rise last night.
This is Dr. Porter in the middle of a three-room emergency room.
Can you tell me more about your chest nerves?
I feel nervous in the front of my body, here, in my chest
I feel a strong nerve in my chest
When I felt that nerve in my chest

Cumulative incident of coronation virus (COVID-19) which increases rapidly in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incident of coronary disease (COVID-19) shows similar trains in the European Union/European Economic Area and the British Raya that confirm that, although it varies depending on the country, COVID-19 is developing very rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, the country, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for the deployment of COVID-19 patients who will need health care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a cluster of unknown etiology pneumonia cases was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
On 9 January 2020, the Tionkok Monitoring and Prevention Centre reported that the cause of the disease was a new coronation virus now called acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-COV-2 infection has been called coronavirus (COVID-19).
Evidence so far shows that about 80% of the COVID-19 suffers from mild illness, namely respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, with most of this suffering healed.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more serious disease and requires hospital care, while 6% of other cases suffer from critical diseases that require intensive care.
Mortality in hospitals due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we studied the COVID-19 cumulative incident train in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and British Raya (UK) and compared it with the incident in Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
We also compared the number of COVID-19 cases currently in the EU/EEA and UK countries to the number of cases in Italy during 31 January–15 March 2020.
Case COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK
After Tiongkok, COVID-19 has been preaching geographically further and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemonium on the other side of the world are now following the pandemonium dynamics in Tiongkok.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) said COVID-19 as a hostage.
In Eurosurveillance 2020, 5 March, Spiteri et al. reported the first Europeans with the COVID-19 case confirmed on the basis of the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 to returnees from Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
On 15 March 2020, the COVID-19 case has been detected across 30 EU/EEA countries and Ingres Raya (UK), between 31 December 2019 and 15 March 2020, including 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths were reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Get the cumulative number and cumulative incident of the COVID-19 case
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported by every country in the world is updated every day at 8.00 p.m. This number is only obtained from official sources such as the country's Kementary Health, national and regional health authorities, and WHO.
This data is used to evaluate COVID-19 trains in the EU/EEA and the UK, and compare them to trains in Italy.
As a case prevalence proxy for COVID-19 active, we counted a 14-day cumulative incident, so counting the natural journey of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and UK, in the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases reported by each country until March 15, 2020 at 8.00 compared to the Italian case during the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 train in EU/EEA and UK
The COVID-19 case in EU/EEA and the UK generally follow a train in Hubei Province (Tiongkok) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the COVID-19 cumulative incident began to increase around 21 February, and then the rapid increase around 28 February 2020 (Additional version).
This train is mainly driven by a rapid increase in the number of cases reported by Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK show a similar cumulative increase in COVID-19 (Additional contents).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and UK countries compared to the cumulative number in Italy during the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
The data suggest that, until March 15 at 8.00, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK reported a total number of cases compared to the total number of Italy cases three weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 cases reported increased rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
A train watching the COVID-19 cumulative incident indicates that the pandemy is increasing at a speed that is comparable to that of all countries.
This is clear from the degree of differences between countries, variations in public health response, and possible differences in the country definition and protocol to choose patients to be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, which includes correspondence testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the Italian region who explained the situation around 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in the region had reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, receiving COVID-19 case data in the hospital and/or intensive care unit at EU/EAA level is only available for each 6% and 1% case (data not shown).
However, data must be collected in a systematic way to complete current monitoring data focusing on the number of cases reported and the number of deaths.
The study carried out in 2010-2011 shows a wide variety of sleeping facilities in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care beds and madya care per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The model scenario related to the fall in health care capacity, with the prevalence assessment of COVID-19 fatal treatment for each EU/EEA country and the UK that are associated with risks >90% above the capacity of intensive care bed, is provided in the sixth ECDC rapid risk analysis of COVID-19.
Because so far, the most clastic cases in certain areas in EU/EEA and UK countries, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of specific regional coverage, information on cases and intensive care accommodation should be provided at the United Kingdom Name Level for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Experiences from Italy and current trains in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemics are developing very rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units should prepare themselves for the SARS-COV-2 community transmission scenario and increase the number of patients with COVID-19 in need of health care, especially intensive care, as is done in the most affected area in Italy.
As shown in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, rapid, proactive, and comprehensible approaches are very important in slowing down the SARS-COV-2, with a shift from a reversal approach to a Mitigation approach, because an increase in the number of rapid cases, as anticipated, may not give the decision-makers and the hospital enough time to understand, accept, and respond properly if this is not previously applied.
The rapid risk assessment also outlines public health steps to mitigate the impact of pandemics.
A short window of opportunity is available when the country has the chance to increase its control effort in slowing down SARS-COV-2 and reducing the pressure on health care.
If it fails, another EU/EEA country’s health care system is likely to face a patient hospitalization that needs intensive care within a few days or weeks to come.
The disease of coronation virus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in Tiongkok and elsewhere in the world, causing disasters for humans.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-COV, which caused SARS to thousands in 2003, SARS-COV-2 may also be transmitted by bats and caused similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
Even so, COVID-19 has a lower level of degradation and mortality than SARS, but more glaring and more about the age of young people, and more about men than women.
In response to a rapid increase in the number of publications on this new disease, this article tries to provide timely and comprehensive insight into the subject of rapid research.
We're going to discuss epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, care, prediction, and disease prevention.
Although many questions remain unanswered, we hope that this examination will help us to understand and prevent the disease that is threatening us.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become a memory that has never happened and is not forgotten for all the Tionghoa people who were ordered to stay at home during the holiday and a few weeks after the disease of the new virus.
This virus is very homologous with the coronation virus (COV) that caused acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-COV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the disease it caused is called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
Epidemics began in Wuhan, Tiongkok, and quickly spread throughout the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
Until March 2, 2020, this virus has resulted in 80,000 COVID-19 cases confirmed, with more than 40,000 patients returned and 3,000 patients died worldwide.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "an enemy of number one" and potential destroys more than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on January 7, 2020, which sets a sequence of viruses isolated from some patients, more than 200 have been published about COVID-19, which covers virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and care.
This focus is focused on research progress in this rapidly expanding field of new subjects.
In some cases, we'll try to compare COVID-19 to SARS and the disease caused by another COV, that is, the Middle East Respiration Syndrome (MERS) in 2012.
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about the prevention and prognosis of diseases and some other unresolved but pressing questions.
According to tradition, COV is considered non-lethal pathogen for humans, especially causing about 15% of the 4.
Even so, in this century, we have found a very pathogenic coV for humans twice, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each causing the first plague in Tiongkok in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and immediately spreading to many other countries with horrific morbidity and mortality.
That's why, COVID-19 is now the third COV disease in recorded human history.
As shown in Gbr. 1.1, the pneumonia cluster was initially unknown for the first time from Wuhan to the National Health Commission of the Republic of Tiongkok on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the CoV sequence was launched.
On January 15, 2020, Wuhan's first fatal case was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20th, the health care provider's infection was reported, which indicates that human-human transmission may occur.
On January 23, a district quarantine was conducted in the city of Wuhan and the entire public transportation was stopped.
On January 24th, the first clinical study on this disease reported that, out of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 patients directly contacting the Wuhan marine food market considered to be the initial site of infection from unknown animal sources.
On January 30, WHO declared this disease a global health emergency.
By the time the report was written, the disease had spread to the whole of Tiongkok and nearly 50 other countries around the world.
Because the situation is developing very quickly, the end-level and the scourge still need to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centre study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 COVID-19 patients, was confirmed, presenting a more recent picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-COV-2 infected people at all ages, but especially at the age of 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those infected over 50 years, only under 20 years of age, and only 14 infected under 10 years of age.
SARS-COV-2 more infected men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 expands into clusters, especially inside and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average time of 5 (2-9) days starting from excellent to diagnosis.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from the receipt to the death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The base number (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before 23 Jan 2020, according to mass transportation time before the Spring Festival in Tiongkok.
Mortality in patients with confirmed cases is 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and mortality is adjusted for all patients with magnitude 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three main risk factors for COVID-19 are the type of pregnancy (male), age (≥60 years), and heavy pneumonia.
CoV is a subfamily of a large sample virus containing only one RNA sense.
CoV can be divided into four types, that is alpha, beta, gamma, and deltas, with alpha- and beta-coV known to infect humans.
Glycoprotein tonol or spike (S) is associated with its cell receptor, angiotensin 2 (ACE 2) enzyme, and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-COV and MERS-COV, then membrane fusion occurs.
The RNA gene is released into the cytoplasm; after the replication of the genomic virus, the genomic RNA is added to the sample glycoprotein and the nucleocapsid protein form a vesicular containing virion, which then undergoes fusion with plasma membranes to release the virus.
The first SARS-COV-2 genomic sequence was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-COV-2 is a new type of beta-COV with more than 99.98% of the 10 samples followed; the sample is taken from the source of the disease, which is the Aquatic Ocean Market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-COV-2 is more similar to SARS-COV than MERS-COV.
Through the electron transmission microscope, the SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the tiny part of the human breath channel epithelium.
ACE2 humans found to be a receptor for SARS-COV-2 as well as SARS-COV.
However, the S SARS-COV-2 protein is related to ACE2 human less than its binding to the S SARS-COV protein, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-COV-2 causes infections that do not separate SARS-COV infection in patients.
SARS-COV-2 can also form new short protein delivered with orf3b and protein secreted with the password of orf8.
Orf3b SARS-CoV-2 protein may play a role in the pathogenity of the virus and the inhibition of IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not have a known functional domain or motive.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the cryo-EM ACE2 complete human structure in resolution 2.9 Å in complex with the carrier of amino acid B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which has open and closed conformation, is arranged in the form of dimer and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, which are evidence for the detection and infection of CoV.
B0AT1 can be the therapeutic target in the drug dispenser to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original and intermediate language
SARS-COV and MERS-COV are known to come from bats and each one is transmitted to humans through insects and eggs.
Through the phylogenetic comparison of SARS-COV-2 with other CoV, the bat is considered to be the original SARS-COV-2 because this new virus is 96% identical to two CoV-like SARS of the bat-SL-COVZX45 and bat-SL-COVZX21.
However, the intermediation of viruses that help to overcome the prevention of species infection is still unknown, and the transmission route still needs to be explained.
Ji, et al. proposed snakes as carriers of viruses from bats to humans involving homologous recombination in the S protein.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, Tiongkok, suggested that the call, the mammary mammal absconds the length of an anomalies commonly used in traditional Tionghoea drugs, potentiated as an inhaler between SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic homologous to CoV found in call and SARS-COV-2.
Even so, 1% of the difference spread throughout the genome is still a big difference; therefore, the final result as concrete evidence is not yet available (Gbr. 3).
The physical chemistry of SARS-CoV-2 is largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-COV and MERS-COV can last 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-COV-2 may have a similar quality.
SARS-COV-2 is reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet and hot light at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, non-infection containing chlorine, acetic acid, chloroform, and other fats, but not chlorhexidine, effectively deactivation of the virus.
In general, the entire human population does not have immunity to SARS-COV-2 and that's why it's slowing down this new virus.
Currently, there are no detailed studies that report immunological responses to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to another COV study previously, especially SARS-COV and MERS-COV (Gbr. 4).
In general, after infestation, the virus is known to be carried by the immune system through a pole identifier (PRR), which includes the C-type lectin-like receptor, the Toll-like receptor (TLR), the NOD-like receptor (NLR), and the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Through a different route, the virus inducts the expression of inflammatory factor, dentrich cell maturity, and type I interferon synthesis (IFN) that restricts the preaching of the virus and speeds up the phagositis of the antigen virus by macrophage.
However, the N protein on SARS-CoV can help prevent an immune response.
Shortly thereafter, the adaptive immune response joined in the fight against this virus.
T lymphocytes, which include CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play an important role in this defense.
CD4+ T cell stimulates B cell to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8+ T cell kills the infected virus directly.
T-cell helper produces proinflammatory sitokins to help protect the cell.
Even so, COV can inhibit T cell function by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humorous immunity, which includes compliments, such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, are also important in the fight against virus infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from patients who have been cured neutralized by MRS-CoV.
On the other hand, excessive immune system reactions produce a large number of locally free radicals, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, on the worst scenario, failure of the organs and even death.
SARS-COV-2 infection, which is marked by the abstinence cluster, is more about age with congenital diseases and pregnant women.
In general, people who are infected with the virus in large numbers or whose immune function is disrupted have a higher chance of infection than others.
The estimate of the average incubation period SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, most of 3-7 days based on a study of the 425 first cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the average incubation period is 3 days and starts from 0 to 24 days.
A recent study, as explained above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on a demographic of 8,866 cases.
Most important health authorities adjust effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period so as to prevent infected people, but without symptoms, transmit the virus to others.
As a general practice, people who are infected with the virus usually have to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
The fever is often a major symptom of COVID-19 and early, with or without other symptoms such as dry mouth, breathing, muscle nerves, softness, headaches, pancreas, rhinorrhea, chest nerves, diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients have dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of disease.
In severe cases, disease progression is rapidly becoming acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or acute respiratory and liver symptoms, even if there is no pulmonary peritoneal peritoneal difference, should be vaccinated against the virus for diagnosis here.
Demographic studies at the end of December 2019 show that the proportion of symptoms is 98% for fever, 76% for drought, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients require fan support.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies, namely studies in family and cluster clusters caused by the transmission of asymptomatic individuals.
Compared to this, demographic studies in 2012 showed that patients with MERS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry sweat (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of patients need ventilation support, much more than patients with COVID-19 and consistent with MERS lethality higher than COVID-19.
Diare (26%) and pancreatic disease (21%) were also observed in patients with MRS.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry drops (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%), and tingling disease (13-25%) are shown as the main characteristics and necessary ventilation support for approximately 14%-20% of patients.
Until February 14th, the mortality of COVID-19 is 2% with confirmed cases reaching 66,576 worldwide.
Compared to that, SARS mortality in November 2002 is 10% of 8,096 confirmed.
For MERC, according to a survey in June 2012, mortality is 37% of 2,494 confirmed.
Previous studies reported that R0 SARS-CoV-2 reached 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while R0 SARS-CoV reached only 2 to 4.
Compared SARS-COV-2 to MRS-COV and SARS-COV in symptoms, mortality, and R0 are given in Table 1.
These figures show that SARS-COV-2 has a higher broadcasting capacity than MRS-COV and SARS-COV, but does not decompose MRS-COV and SARS-COV.
Therefore, the challenge of controlling the SARS-COV-2 pandemic is greater than the MRS-COV pandemic and SARS-COV pandemic.
Avitan is often found in a family or in a group or in a vehicle such as a boat.
Patients often have a travel history or live in Wuhan or other identified areas or contact the infected or patients in the last two weeks before the visit.
However, it has been reported that people can carry viruses without showing symptoms more than two weeks and patients returned from the hospital can carry the virus again, resulting in increased quarantine time.
Initially, patients have normal or descending white blood cells (especially lymphocytes).
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count < 4×109/L, which includes lymphocyte count < 1×109/L, and aspartate aminotransferase and increased viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The incidence of cardiac and muscle enzymes and myoglobins increases in the number of patients, as well as C-reactive proteins and blood rate increases in most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the rate of D-dimer increased, i.e. the product of fibrin cooling in the blood, and the lymphocyte count gradually decreased.
The photo differences of the chest were found in the large form of COVID-19 patients and marked with bilateral cloud shadow or ground-glass resistance in the lungs.
Patients often experience atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
When the ARDS occurs, tactercontrol inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis have greatly increased gas exchange disturbances.
Type I and Type II pneumonia dysfunction decreases surfactance and increases surface pressure so as to reduce lung capacity to develop and increase the risk of lung collapse.
As a result, the worst finding in the chest is often parallel to the worst disease rate.
On February 18, 2020, the first COVID-19 pathology analysis showed pneumosis, the formation of hyalin membranes, and interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, and the sentimental cell involved a lot in the lung of patients who died from this disease, according to the pathology of viral infection and ARDS and similar to the analysis of the pathology of patients SARS and MRS.
RNA SARS-CoV-2 detection through reverse polymerase transcriptase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, because of its false negative level, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (not only RT-PCR) in Tiongkok on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation occurred on SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, the combination between disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiology findings is very important and a need to make an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the group Feng Zhang explained the protocol of use of the SHERLOCK technique based on CRISPR to detect SARS-COV-2, which detects synthetic RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L up to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) using cell stick within less than one hour without needing complicated instrumentation.
Hopefully, this new technique can greatly increase sensitivity and ease if verified on a clinical sample.
Because of the lack of experience with the new CoV, the main doctor offered supportive care to patients with COVID-19, while trying various therapies previously used or initiated for other CoV treatments, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
This therapy covers the current therapy and potential therapy with antivirals, immunosuppressives, steroids, plasma from patients who have been cured, traditional Tionghoea medicines, and psychological support.
Even plasma from patients who have been cured is indicated for use in therapy.
A racing pharmaceutical company is developing antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
In the early stages, SARS-COV-2 mainly attacks the lungs and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 at a lower level, such as the gastrointestinal and kidney systems.
However, breathing disorders and failures pose a major threat to the patient and to the leading cause of death.
Therefore, breathing support is very important to relieve symptoms and save lives, which include general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the level of disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported by the oxygenation of extracorporeal membrane (ECMO), the most modified cardiopulmonary portal technique used to treat heart failure or breathing that threatens the soul.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and siocoa, as well as the protection of vital organ function are also very important for patients with SARS-COV-2.
The immune system’s over-exposure reaction is known to result in a stokine disaster in SARS and MERS patients.
Sitokin storms are a form of systemic inflammatory response that marks the release of a set of sitokin, which includes TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These sitokins induct immune cells to release a large number of free radicals that are the main cause of the ARDS and failure of an organ.
Immunosuppression is very important in the management of sitokins, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to handle sitokin storms.
Other immunosuppression management for sitokin storms includes the modulation of immune response to T cells; ifn-γ, IL-1, and TNF blockade; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; sitokin 4 signal graft; and HDAC inhibitor.
Steroid, as immunosuppression, is widely used in SARS treatment to reduce the risk of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids are not useful for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, steroids can cause side effects, especially osteonecrosis, which are highly predictive.
Even so, short-dose corticosteroids at low doses are being encouraged to be given with caution to patients with COVID-19 who are critically ill.
At the time of this evaluation, no effective antivirus therapy has been confirmed.
However, the intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be rich in a COVID-19 patient from America.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral medicine developed by Gilead, again for the treatment of Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
In time, remdesivir also showed inhibition of another single RNA virus, which includes MERS and SARS.
On this basis, Gilead has provided this alive for Tiongkok to perform a series of tests on the infected SARS-COV-2, and the results are very surprising.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been recommended as potential therapy for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, heart failure, and other side effects may occur following combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this therapy with other medicinal products used in patients should be thoroughly monitored.
Plasma of a patient who has been cured and has been able to create antibodies
There is a long history of blood collection that has been healed from inherited diseases to treat other patients who have the same disease or to prevent the health of the affected.
Granted, a patient who has been healed often has a relatively high level of antibodies in his blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight other pathogens and foreign objects, recognize unique molecules on the pathogen, and directly neutralize it.
Based on this, plasma is collected from the blood of a group of patients who have been cured from COVID-19 and injected into 10 patients with severe disease.
Their symptoms improve within 24 hours, accompanied by lowering the inflammation and burden of the virus and increasing oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification have to be done to suggest this method for the use of a large scale before specific therapy is developed.
Further, in addition to its therapeutic effects, some plasma-related deficiencies need to be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can stimulate immune responses excessively and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life - threatening toxicity.
Antibodies in blood are usually low and plasma levels are needed in large numbers to treat a critical patient.
The development and production of specific antibodies quickly enough to fight the global epidemic is difficult.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B-cells from patients who have been cured and to identify genetic codes that affect effective antibodies or make effective antibodies to proteins that are important to the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the size of our body’s production.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in Tiongkok for thousands of years.
However, most of the effects depend on the combination of various components in the formula, and this formula varies depending on the diagnosis of disease based on TCM theory.
Most effective components are still unknown or not clear because it is difficult to extract or verify the component or its optimal combination.
Now, because effective and specific therapy for COVID-19 is not yet available, TCM is one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who recover from a serious illness.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found suitable for COVID-19 therapy.
Top level of recovery in COVID-19 patient therapy was observed in some Tigkok provinces using TCM at 87% of its patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used TCM only at about 30% of COVID-19 patients, had a modest recovery rate (13%).
However, this comparison is still very difficult because many other factors, such as the number and degradation of patients, need to be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and friends were involved in a study comparing Western drug therapy (WM) only with WM and TCM combination therapy.
They found that the time needed to restore body temperature, missing symptoms, and miscarriage was much shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone.
More impressive, the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) is much lower for the WM+TCM group compared to only the WM group (7.4% than 46.2%) and mortality lower for the WM+TCM group compared to only the WM group (8.8% than 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and security of TCMs are still waiting for a better controlled test on a larger scale and at more research centres.
Another interesting thing is to create a working mechanism and to clarify effective components in TCM therapy or combination, if possible.
Most of the patients who were expected or confirmed COVID-19 felt very afraid of a very painful and even fatal disease, and those who were quarantined also felt boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Further, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, and insomnia and side effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can cause greater anxiety and mental pressure.
In the early stages of SARS, a range of psychiatric morbidity, including depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor seizures, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicide have been reported.
Exploring the history of contacts and compulsory quarantine, as part of a public health response to COVID-19, can make people become more concerned and feel guilty about the effects of paralysis, quarantine, and stigma on relatives and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for patients with COVID-19, those expected, and those who contact them, and the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of a multidisciplinary mental health team, clear communication with routine change and accurate about SARS-CoV-2 disease, and therapy and professional device and electronic applications to avoid contact with each other.
An effective vaccine is very important to break down the transmission chain from the animal and human reservoirs infected to the slow and often self-absorbing virus therapy in the control of the epidemic caused by the outbreak of the virus.
Efforts have been made to develop S-based vaccines, which long and effectively produce neutral antibodies and/or immunity that protect against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, live attenuated vaccines have been evaluated on test animals.
Nevertheless, the in vivo efficacy of this vaccine candidate in the age and model of lethal challenges and its protection against zoonotic virus infection should be determined before clinical studies are started.
It's probably because SARS suffered 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
Instead, the sporadic case and the MRS cluster continue to take place in the Middle East and spread to other regions because there are still zoonotic sources in the endemic region.
The vaccination strategy has been developed for MERS using deactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, virus vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and recombinant protein subunits and some have been evaluated on test animals.
The development of vaccines against the safe and effective SARS-COV-2 for non-immune people is a very urgent and important task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this problem is not easy to overcome because of a long time to develop a vaccine (average 18 months) and a dynamic COV variant.
As a new disease, COVID-19 just started showing the full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient is able to heal without a single patient.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, establishing a predictive model of disease is very important for the health care body to prioritise its services, especially in the area with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table 3):
Age: Age is the most important factor for SARS prognosis, which also occurs for COVID-19.
COVID-19 especially happened at 30-65 years of age with 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age in a study containing 8,866 cases as explained above.
Patients who require intensive care tend to have concombination and complications and significantly older age than patients who do not need intensive care (median 66 years of age than 51 years), which indicates age as a predictive factor for end-of-patient COVID-19.
The second type: SARS-COV-2 more infected men than women (0.31/100,000 than 0.27/100,000), as explained above.
Comorbidity and complication: patients with COVID-19 who need intensive care are more likely to have acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
Heart attacks also cause major causes of death in SARS patients.
SARS-COV-2 is also reported to be associated with collangiosis with ACE2-positive, which can cause cardiac dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and underlying illness are highly corrosive and can affect one another.
Abnormal laboratory findings: C-reactive protein (CRP) in blood reflects inflammation or network damage and is produced as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and end-to-end recovery.
Corelius between the CRP and the CRP and the COVID-19 prediction has also been produced.
In addition, increases in dehydrogenase lactate (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict the end result.
These enzymes are expressed very high in various organs, especially in the heart and heart, and released during network damage.
Therefore, these enzymes are a traditional sign of heart and heart function.
Key clinical symptoms: Photos of the chest and development of the temporal clinical symptoms must be considered together with other things to predict the end result and the complexity of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As explained above, steroids are immunosuppressives that are widely used as anti-infection therapy to reduce inflammation damage.
Because high-dose corticosteroids are widely used in severe SARS patients, many people who survive this disease eventually suffer from avascular osteonecrosis with life-long disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low dose and short-term in patients with COVID-19.
Mental pressure: As explained above, during COVID-19, many patients suffer from extraordinary stress because they have to undergo long-term quarantine and extreme uncertainty and witness the death of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological advice and long-term support should be given to help this patient recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have an epidemiological picture different from SARS.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-COV-2 can effectively replication in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms at the initial infection phase, similar to other coV causing itching.
Therefore, in the early phase or incubation period, the infected patient can produce a large number of viruses during daily activities, which cause great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmissions were believed to occur when patients were severely ill and most did not occur at the early stage.
Thus, the COVID-19 disease currently is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS disease.
Now, a great effort is being made in Tiongkok, which covers quarantine in Wuhan and the cities around and quarantines almost the entire population with the hope of breaking down the SARS-COV-2 transmission.
Although these actions have been devastating to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients has fallen, indicating the slowdown of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate says the disease will end in March and the sequence phase will take place for 3-4 months.
However, some other scholars did not consider it to be septic.
Paul Hunter et al. estimated that the COVID-19, which seems much more expensive than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. made a model to predict the end of the epidemic and stated that SARS-COV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
Canada's group of researchers reported that SARS-COV-2 was detected in mid-concentration and tingling patients who had been cured and returned from hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the virus that was re-identified could be a recurring episode, like influenza.
Nevertheless, the signs of the promise occurred in Tiongkok, if seen on the basis of the downturn in the number of new cases, which shows that this strategy at the moment might succeed.
Ebola was again predicted to cause one million deaths, including one and a half million deaths.
However, quarantine and insulation have proved to be effective in controlling the disease.
Maybe, like SARS-COV, SARS-COV-2 weakens its ability to infect and eventually disappears or become a virus not too pathogen that can be sidelined with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemic was given below (Gbr. 5).
SARS-COV-2 is very easy to transmit through abstinence or abstinence, and perhaps also through direct contact with the substance contaminated by the virus.
This virus was also found in the faeces so that it could trigger a new transmission, i.e. the faeces-mouth transmission.
A recent study in 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may be caused by nosocomial infections, which included 17 patients with other diseases before and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, proper preventive measures must be taken to protect people, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, workmates, and even those who accidentally contact patients or those who are infected.
The first line of defense that can be used to lower the risk of infection is through the use of the facial mask, both the knife mask and the N95 respiratory mask (the 1860s series) help control the spread of the virus.
The surgical masks keep the scars of those who are infected with the potential do not touch the air or smear on the surface of the material, and the scars of the scars can be passed on to others.
However, only the N95 (series number 1860s) masks that can protect against the inhalation of the virion with a small size of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virion can completely penetrate; SARS-CoV-2 similar to SARS-CoV in size, both sizes about 85 nm.
Since particulates can infiltrate even five surgical masks into one, health care providers who contact patients directly have to wear N95 (the 1860s series number) and not a surgical mask.
In addition to masks, health care providers have to wear adequate insulation clothing to reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also cause eye infections.
On January 22, 2020, a surgeon infected SARS-COV-2 despite wearing a N95 mask; the virus may enter his body through eye contact.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear a face - to - face scarf or glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in the most visible or potentially visible areas, it is highly recommended for each person to wash his hands with soap infected more often than usual, try to stay at home for quarantine, and avoid contact with people who are potentially infected.
Three feet is sure to keep the patient away.
These actions are an effective method of reducing the risk of infection and preventing the spread of viruses.
Although SARS-COV-2 is a new virus for the human world, its high homologous with SARS-COV, as reported on January 7, 2020, it should be a great reminder for Tiongkok, who has a strong memory of the SARS disease in 2003.
However, on January 19, 2020, the director of Wuhan’s Disease Control Center calmed the people by saying that this new virus has a low preaching quality and limited reproductive capacity from humans to humans and the prevention and prevention of this disease is not a problem.
This message greatly calms the fear of society, especially when the whole country is preparing the Spring Festival, so the critical time has passed to cover small-scale diseases in Wuhan.
The disease control body in Tiongkok should draw lessons from this and make major improvements in the future.
For example, this body should (1) be more careful when making a public announcement because every word is observed by the people and can change their attitude and decision; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to non-clinical information than expected official reports from a doctor or official authority; (3) be more limited to covering the potential of the epidemic at an early stage, not trying to calm the public; and (4) be more frequent in targeting and effective training to raise public awareness of the epidemic and test and increase the system of public response periodically.
The COVID-19 disease was caused by a new SARS-CoV-2 virus that started to explode at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the plague has spread throughout Tiongkok and more than 50 countries in the world at the time of this survey.
Since this virus is very similar to SARS-COV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the COVID-19 disease has a similar effect as the SARS disease has returned.
However, there are some clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are very important to cover the epidemic and deal with patients.
COVID-19 is more about the age of young people and more about men than women, and the rate of death is also higher in age than that of young people.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID-19 mortality (10.91% than 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit viruses even when they have no symptoms, whereas SARS patients usually transmit viruses when they are severely ill, which makes it more difficult to cover COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains some of the reasons for SARS-COV-2 spread faster and wider than SARS-COV.
The routine RNA base to check SARS-COV-2 can produce negative results in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, a patient who has been healed may be able to return to the positive side of the virus.
This finding greatly increases the risk of spreading the virus.
As soon as the progress of the COVID-19 research has been made, some important issues still need to be resolved, that is:
Where did SARS-COV-2 come from?
Although genetic homology is found to be 96% between SARS-COV-2 and two coVs like SARS-COV-2, we still can't conclude that SARS-COV-2 comes from the driver.
What animal is an intermediate species to suppress the virus from the source, tell the bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answer to numbers 1 and 2, we can't stop the transmission effectively and the plague can crash back every time.
Although molecular models and biochemistry bases show that SARS-COV-2 is related to ACE2, how exactly does the virus get into the breathing stream cell and lead to further pathological changes?
Does this virus also relate to a cell that expresses ACE2 in another organ?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic go on?
How does the virus develop genetically during human transmission?
Would this pandemy be a pandemy all over the world, ending up like SARS, or repeating periodically like flu?
The answers to the above and many other questions are very important, but it may take time to find it.
Even so, whatever the cost, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible so that we can return to normal life.
The origin of the human coronation virus
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have driven co-evolution of co-evolution of the coronal virus (COV) and its membranes, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two human coVs (HcoVs) were known to cause such diseases as seismic disease.
Acute breathing syndrome (SARS) and Middle East breathing syndrome (MERS) reverse conditions and reveal how devastating and life threatening HCV infections can be.
The emergence of SARS-COV-2 in the centre of Tiongkok in late 2019 has made CoV a redundancies and surprises us with high transmissions, but with lower pathogenicity than its brother, SARS-COV.
HCOV infection is zoonosis, so the original understanding of HCOV will benefit us.
Most of the HCOV comes from bats, and in this animal, the virus is not pathogenic.
Inang reservoirs among some HCOVs have also been known.
Animal identification has a direct involvement in the prevention of human diseases.
Animal CoV interaction research can also provide important care about human coV pathogenesis.
In this survey, we presented a general picture of the current knowledge of the seven HCOV, focusing on its history and its zoonotic origin and its interspecies transmission.
What's important, we're comparing and contrasting the HCV from the perspective of evolution and genomic recombination.
Epidemi disease COV 2019 (COVID-19) is currently being discussed in this context.
In addition, the conditions for successful exchange and the involvement of viruses in the spread of diseases have been identified.
Coronaviridae virus (COV) is a species of virus in the family Coronaviridae, which consists of a group of fluxed RNA viruses, positive indrinses, and single-breathing viruses.
This virus has the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilograms between the RNA virus called "CoV", because its morphology is like a crown under a microscope electron.
Based on its structure, CoV has unsegmentated genomes that have similar landings.
About two thirds of the genome consists of two large open-range readings (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are interlocked. Both were translated into polyprotein replications pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyprotein is further processed to form 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome consists of an open-ended reading (ORF) for structural proteins, which include tones or spikes (S), envelopes or envelopes (E), membranes (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of complete proteins that are specific to a particular line of descent are also produced by various lines of descent of the COV.
Depending on the protein sequences, CoV is classified as four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among the four genera, the beta-CoV type has the most HCV and is again divided into four offspring lines (A, B, C, and D).
Philogenetic evidence shows that rodents and animals are the source of most alpha-COV and beta-COV genes, while the gas is the main reservoir of gamma-COV and delta-COV.
For thousands of years, CoV has continued to go through the prevention of species and some CoV has become an important pathogen for humans.
So far, there are seven known human coVs (HcoVs).
Among the seven viruses, HCV-229E and HCV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
Five other beta-COVs include HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, severe respiratory coronary syndrome (SARS-COV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-COV), and SARS-COV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, and HCOV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as itching and/or diarrhoea.
On the other hand, SARS-COV, MERS-COV, and SARS-COV-2 are very pathogenic, causing low-weight respiratory infections in relatively more patients and have a higher chance to develop into acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and manifestations outside the lung.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from a sesame patient in the mid-60s.
Since then, more and more knowledge has been gathered through a thorough study of HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, both leading to healing symptoms.
In fact, this concept has been widely accepted that HCV infection is generally harmless, until SARS disease occurs.
The SARS disease that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating diseases in modern history, which infected more than 8,000 people with severe deaths of about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Breathing Syndrome (MERS) caused an epidemic of foot - and - mouth disease in the Arab Peninsula with the preaching of the good news to other parts of the world.
The new HCV 2019 (2019-nCoV), hereinafter called SARS-COV-2, is a causative agent of the coronary disease epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), which has killed more than 3.120 people and infected more than 91,000 people until March 3, 2020.
The alarm has already gone off, and the world has to prepare for the upcoming SARS-COV-2 pandemic.
The seven HCOVs all have zoonotic origins from bats, rats, or pets.
Many of the evidence supports the origins of all the HCOVs of bats.
The COVID-19 epidemic has led to enormous medical, scientific, social, and moral challenges for Tiongkok and the whole world.
Explore HCOV's zoonotic origins provide a framework of work to understand natural history, the ability to move, and the limitation factor of the transfer between species.
This study can also guide or facilitate the search for pets, intermediaries, and SARS-COV-2 amplification, which has an important role in the prevention of the coming preaching.
In this study, we gave a general picture of the origin of zoonotic, interspecies transmission, and HCV pathogenesis.
We specifically focus and discuss the general topic that the primary HCOV virus is usually non-pathogenic in its natural reservoir, but is pathogenic after the interspecies transmission to the new source.
We also analyzed the HCOV evolution train that the increase in transmission capacity is often accompanied by pathogenicity.
The end result of SARS-COV-2 is also discussed in this context.
CoV animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the isolation of HCOV-229E strain B814 of the first selesmous patient, various COVs have been isolated from infected animals, including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In some recent sources, seven HCVs have been identified.
The short history of HCV detection in chronological order (Table 1) is an informative guide.
The first HCOV-229E strain was isolated from the patient's respiratory tract that had an upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, which was further adapted to be established in the WI-38 lung cell line.
HCoV-229E infected patients show seismic symptoms, which include headaches, dizziness, leukaemia, and throat problems, including fever and swelling seen in 10~20% of the case.
Next in 1967, HCOV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and serial pathways in the still intrusive brain.
The clinical picture of HCV-OC43 infection appears to be similar to the infection caused by HCV-229E, which cannot be symptomatically distinguished with the infection of other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A and rhinovirus.
HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 spread throughout the world and the most popular trends have been transmitted during the cold season in the advertising area.
Usually, the time of incubation of these two viruses is less than a week and is followed by sick time for about two weeks.
On the basis of a human volunteer study, healthy people infected with HCV-229E have a mild stroke.
Only a few patients with a weak body immune system that shows low-weight respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as the "pneumonia atipis", is a first-ever HCOV pandemic well documented in human history and its etiology agent is SARS-CoV, which is the third HCOV found.
The first SARS case could be traced back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, Tiongkok.
SARS epidemics have resulted in 8,096 deaths reported in 774 countries and continents.
Apart from the superintendent, each case is expected to cause about two secondary cases, with 4 to 7 days incubation time and the virus peaks visible on the 10th day of disease.
Patients who were first infected with SARS-COV experienced myalgia, headache, fever, lesion, and tingling, followed by dyspnea, convulsions, and respiratory disorders as a follow-up.
Lymphopenia, abnormal heart function tests, and increased kinase creatine are laboratory abnormalities that affect SARS.
Alveolar fusion, epithelial cell proliferation, and macrophage increases are also observed in SARS patients.
Next, about 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, some organs that contain gastrointestinal, heart, and kidney channels can also be infected in severe cases, usually accompanied by catocine, which can kill, especially in patients whose obesity is weak.
The virus was first isolated from lung biopsy opened to relatives of zero patients traveling to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, very much effort has been devoted to HCOV research.
HCOV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old from the Netherlands in late 2004.
This virus was initially very communicable to young children, old people, and patients with mild breathing problems.
Figures of corisan, conjunctivitis, fever, and lazimal bronchiolitis were found in diseases caused by HCV-NL63.
Other independent studies explain the same virus isolation from the 8-month-old male births species that suffer from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, the virus is widespread worldwide.
It's estimated that HCOV-NL63 represents about 4.7% of the general respiratory disease and its peak occurred in the early summer, spring, and winter.
HCOV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called crotch.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been treated for pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and community bronchiolitis, HCV-HKU1 is reported to be associated with acute asthma exacerbation.
Similar to HCV-NL63, HCV-229E, and HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 was found worldwide, causing mild respiratory disease.
These four HCOV communities have all been adapted to humans and generally have a small chance of mutations becoming very pathogens. However, an extraordinary case has happened because of unknown reasons, such as in the case of subtype HCOV-NL63 more virulent recently reported cause of low-weight respiratory infection in Tiongkok.
In general, when the ability to move efficiently and continue to defend oneself in humans, the virulence and pathogenity of HCOV are also reduced.
MERS-COV was first isolated in 2012 from a 60-year-old lung with acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the confirmed cases came from the Middle East, the case of an import once - a - time secondary preaching to close contacts has been reported in various European and Tunisian countries.
Another secondary illness occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
Mers clinical manifestations are similar to SARS clinical manifestations, created by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also have acute kidney failure, which has so far only happened on MERS among the diseases caused by HCOV.
More than 30% of patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
Until February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed laboratory cases were reported with high case deaths, which were 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most fearsome viruses known to humans.
In the mid to late December 2019, the retrospective pneumonia patient cluster related to SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said that the respiratory infection of the lower respiratory tract is ongoing and caused by SARS-COV-2 as a Global Health Emergency and named it COVID-19.
Until 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with the death rate of 3.4%.
It must be noted that the death of a case in Hubei, Tiongkok, is 4.2%, while the death of a case outside Hubei is 1.2%.
SARS-COV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-COV and MERCS-COV with a description of the fever, swelling, and breathing.
Diare was also found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can develop rapidly into acute respiratory syndrome.
Although SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 are very similar due to high-level nucleotide homology, 82%, both grouped into different phylogenetic trees.
SARS-COV-2 pathogens are clearly lower, but more complicated than SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
The infected subjects of SARS-COV-2 without symptoms have been reported and may be involved in the rapid preaching of SARS-COV-2 throughout the world.
Comparing and separating SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCOV shows very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation and duration of the journey are very similar to HCV.
In this case, SARS-COV-2 follows another six HCOV general trains.
Second, COVID-19 is located between SARS-COV and four other HCV communities (i.e. HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, and HCV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more common picture of HCV community infection, which includes a non-specific symptom picture of light or even without symptoms.
On the other hand, a small part of the COVID-19 case can look like SARS-COV infection even with a slightly lower radius.
Third, SARS-COV-2 transmissions also show interesting patterns, having connections with the HCV community and SARS-COV.
On the one hand, the ability to transmit SARS-CoV-2 is at least the same as the HCOV community.
On the other hand, there is no downsizing of SARS-COV-2 transmission capacity after several human pathways still need to be verified, such as the SARS-COV and MERS-COV case.
Last, just like the other HCV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from a feses sample.
"Is the transmission of SARS-COV-2 faecal-oral plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-COV transmission, at least in a particular situation, that must still be confirmed by the next study."
What's also very important to know is whether SARS-COV-2 is seasonally like in the case of the HCOV community.
Anyway, the drawing of SARS-COV-2, which includes the ability to transmit, pathogenisity, and preach in several human pathways, will have a profound effect on the fate of the end of the ongoing COVID-19 disease.
Four HCOV communities that caused the simple symptoms of all have been adapted to human beings.
From another point of view, it can be said that humans have adapted to these four HCOVs.
In other words, both HCOV and humans may be the species of HCOV pandemonium.
HCOV causing serious human and human suffering from severe HCOV disease has been eliminated.
In order for this to happen, HCOV must be replicated in humans in a limited number to allow adaptive mutation accumulation to fight affluence.
As a result, the longer SARS-COV-2 disease lasts and the more infected, the greater the likelihood that this virus will be fully man-made.
If the virus is well-adjusted, transmission to humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infection control steps.
For years, four CoV communities have gone to the human population and have smeared people with immunocompetence.
This virus does not need an animal reservoir.
Rather, SARS-COV and MERS-COV that are very pathogenic have not yet been designed with humans and its transmission into humans cannot be defended.
Both have to defend themselves and make a hole in the zoonotic reservoir and look for opportunities to preach to people who are vulnerable, likely through one or more channels and amplification.
SARS-COV-2 has a picture similar to SARS-COV/MERS-COV and four HCV communities.
SARS-COV-2 is very easy to transmit as HCOV community, at least now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than the HCV community and is not septogenic SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
Whether SARS-COV-2 will be fully man-made and circulated in humans without the use of a reservoir or an intermediate animal is still to be observed.
Before discussing the origin of HCV animals, we need to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate, and the amplification of HCV.
Animals act as HCOV evolutionary fungi if they have a close-closed ancestor and share high homologous levels of nucleotide sequences.
The ancient virus is usually well-adapted and non-pathogenic in this vein.
Similarly, the tanker’s tanker carried the HCOV in shock and in the course of a long time.
In these two cases, the infected fungus is naturally and is the natural fungus for HCOV or the primary virus.
On the other hand, if a new HCV enters the lining just before or about the time of the virus enters the human body, the virus has not been adapted to the new lining and is often pathogenic.
It can function as a zoonotic source of human infection and act as an amplification source by allowing viruses to be temporarily replicated, and then transmit it to humans to amplify the human infection scale.
HCoV may have a blue infection if it cannot withstand transmission in the middle wave.
On the other hand, HCOV is able to adapt to the internal needs and even lead to long - term emancipation.
In this regard, the umbilical cord becomes the natural reservoir.
Epidemiology data retrospectively revealed that the SARS zero case has a history of contact with birds.
Seroprevalence studies further indicate that the animal salesman has a higher IgG anti-SARS-CoV prevalence than the general population.
The month month (Paguma larvata) and the dog raccoon in the live animal market are the first to be identified with viruses like SARS-COV that are almost identical to SARS-COV.
Indirectly, this is supported by the fact that no more SARS cases have been reported since all the bugs on the market were killed.
In addition, it has been reported that the month of the wild or wild animal that is not spread to the pet market most of the animal produces negative testing for SARS-COV, which indicates that the month of the month may only act as an amplification for the inter-, but not a natural resorvoir of SARS-COV.
It has to be noted, because 80% of the animals on the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-COV antibodies, cannot be sided with that many small mammals may also function as an amplification agent between SARS-COV.
All of this seems to be the end of SARS-COV.
The wild animal search for SARS-COV further revealed a nearby COV star, called the Rhinolopus animal relative SARS-HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCOV HKU3), which is found in the Tionkok horse cover.
This rider provides positive test results for anti-SARS-COV antibodies and sequences of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These COVs and other COVs share the 88-92% nucleotide sequence homologies with SARS-COV.
This study is a foundation for a new concept that bats are the food for new human pathogens.
Some CoVs like SARS (SL-CoV) have also been identified by bats, but only one, given the name WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) enzyme is an unknown SARS-COV receptor.
The WIV1 derived from the lens phase sample is shown using the ACE2 lens, the lens, and the human as a receptor to enter the cell.
Interestingly, a conventional SARS serum can neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the ancestor closest to SARS-CoV in the jaw, with a 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Apart from the homology between these two viruses, it's generally believed that WIV1 is not the primary direct SARS-CoV virus and the star is not a reserve of direct SARS-CoV.
Philogenetic analysis groupes MERS-COV into the same group as CoV-HKU4 stars and CoV-HKU5 stars.
CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-COV use the same soft receptor, i.e. peptidyl peptidease 4 (DPP4), as the way into the virus.
The sequence of RNA polymerase depends on the RNA MERS-CoV in a phylogenetic way closer to it on the beta-CoV star identified by Europe and Africa.
So far, no MERS-CoV lives have been found in the wild.
MERS-COV and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 are only 87% of the nucleotide sequence homologous.
That's why, the monster may not be a tanker of direct MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East show that Arab eggs produce seropositive results for specific antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV, just like those of the Middle East in some African countries.
Mers-Cov lives that are identical to the virus found in humans isolated from the nasopharyngitis of Arab eggs, which further indicates that the egg is a real reservoir for Mers-Cov.
What is also important is that the spread of massive viruses with symptoms that are usually mildly observed in test monkeys infected with MERS-CoV.
It has to be noted, the eggs that are infected break down the virus not only through the respiratory route, but also through the faecal-oral route, which is also the main route of virus outbreaks from bats.
However, the question is not yet answered because many MERS confirmed cases do not have a history of contact with eggs prior to the onset of symptoms, the possibility of human-human transmissions or unknown transmission routes involving unknown animal species carrying MERS-COV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of the nucleotide homologous with CoV of RaTG13 isolated from Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the SARS-COV and MERS-COV cases, the sequence difference between SARS-COV-2 and RATG13 is too big to establish a parental relationship.
In other words, the monster may not be a reserve of direct SARS-COV-2, unless the COV is almost identical found later on.
There are probably some species of SARS-COV-2 that are sold and killed in the Great Sea Food Market. Many early COVID-19 cases are related to this market, which indicates that it is likely that animal-human transmissions occur.
Some recent studies based on the metagenometic sequence show that a small group of endangered mammals, known as manis javanica, may also bring beta-COVs that are close to SARS-COV-2.
The new COV gene is 85-92% of the nucleotide sequence homologous with SARS-COV-2.
However, the coV is as close to RaTG13 as 90% in the nucleotide sequence.
Both are grouped into two sub-genuine viruses such as SARS-COV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which is part of the receptor binding domain (RBD) more similar to SARS-COV-2, with a 97.4% amino acid sequence.
The thing is, RBD SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are much different, even though the homologous level of the entire genome is higher.
The previous study on the sick call also reported the detection of contagion virus from the lung sample, which also appeared to be close to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted a different method of eradication and manual thought to produce a sequence of partial genomes consisting of about 86.3% of complete genome viruses.
We can't be sidetracked by the possibility of calling as one of the animal sources between SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence that supports SARS-COV-2 comes directly from the call because the difference between SARS-COV-2 and beta-COV relative SARS-COV-2 calls.
In addition, the distance between SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 is even closer than the distance between SARS-COV-2 and beta-COV relative SARS-COV-2.
The SARS-COV-2 evolutionary pathways in the blind, call, and other mammals still need to be established.
Although the highest secondary homology on RBD was found between SARS-COV-2 and beta-COV relative SARS-COV-2, SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 were divided into the highest secondary homology at the level of the entire genome.
It's too much speculation if it's said that the rise in the rate between the beta-CoV RBD relative SARS-CoV-2 calls and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by the convergence evolution that its selectivity mediated.
Comparative hypotheses support the recombination between beta-CoV relative SARS-CoV-2 calling and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a factor of evolution, many recombinations occur between beta-CoVs.
Researchers still can't decide on the origin of SARS-COV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCV, the origin of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63, and HCV-HKU1 zoonotics have also been examined.
Philogenetic evidence indicates that HCV-NL63 and HCV-229E may come from the cov of the vertebrate, while primary HCV-OC43 and HCV-HKU1 viruses have been found in rodent animals.
It has been reported that the ARCoV.2 (Rigge CoV Appalakian) that was detected in three North American stars shows proximity to HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E genetically related to other COVs, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, with Camelidae is also expected to be among them.
To make it clear, the current knowledge of the origin of HCOV animals known as Figure 1 and Table 2.
Philogenetic analysis has provided evidence of the transmission of HCOV interspecies in history.
In about 1890, when HCOV-OC43 crossed species of animals to infect humans, it was recorded that there was a pancreas of respiratory infection.
The history of HCV-229E interspecies is not too clear.
Alpha-CoV star close to HCOV-229E has been found.
Between them, there's alpha-coV alpaca.
Some evidence supports the transmission of viruses directly from bats to humans.
First of all, humans, not alpaca, may interact with the stars in the ecological wheel together.
On the contrary, humans have a close relationship with the apex.
Second, the alpha-COV nebula that is close to HCV-229E has a variety of types and nonpathogenics in the nebula, while alpha-COV alpaca causes respiratory disease in infected animals.
Last time, alpha-coV alpaca was not found in feral animals.
That's why it's possible for alpaca to get the alpha-CoV relative HCOV-229E from humans that can't be sided.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, which include rabies, Ebola, Nipah, and Hendra.
Therefore, it is not too surprising that bats may directly transmit HCOV-229E to humans.
Another possibility, while alpha-COV bats function as the HCOV-229E gene lung, alpaca and Arab eggs may function as an intermediate feed that transmits viruses to humans, just like the MERS-COV case.
MERS-COV is a very good example for the transmission of interspecies from bats to Arab eggs and from Arab eggs to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known in the initial identification of the virus and is also enhanced with the discovery after it.
Clearly, bats are the pathogens of rich virus species for the exchange of genetic fragments of interspecies and interspecies transmission.
A long age, a close-sorted colony, a close social interaction, and a strong flying ability, all are a condition that supports the bats to be the ideal 'virus preacher'.
On the other hand, Mers-CoV has been in Arab love for decades.
This virus has been adapted to eggs that have changed from the in between to the stable and natural reservoir.
MERS-COV causes a very mild disease and defends a relatively low mutation rate in this animal.
Its sporadic transmission to humans happened by chance, and man remains the final one for MERS-COV because the transmission cannot be interrupted.
Not like the role of the egg in the Mers-CoV transmission, the call role, if any, in the SARS-CoV-2 transmissions different.
In particular, beta-COV calling is very pathogenic in calling.
Calling may be the end of the beta-COV relative SARS-COV-2, similar to that in the case of SARS-COV.
In the upcoming studies, some possible transmission of SARS-COV-2 interspecies from animals to humans should be counted or sided.
First, the bat could be a reservoir for SARS-COV-2 related viruses that are almost identical to SARS-COV-2.
Humans are able to share the ecological clock with the blind by healing or by digging rocks.
Second, the call could only be one of the internal amplification pathways for the newly entered SARS-COV-2 virus.
Humans receive viruses through the treatment and consumption of poultry meat.
Maybe, a lot of mammals, covering pets, slowing down the SARS-COV-2.
Antibodies should be monitored for both pets and wild animals.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-COV-2 may occur in a third species that interact well with the stars or the call.
The original search for SARS-COV-2 is still ongoing.
Beyond the various animal species, three main factors from the virus side are also important to make the coV easier to overcome by preventing species.
First, its relative rate of mutation is high in the RNA replication.
Compared to another single chance RNA virus, the calculation of the CoV mutation rate can be considered "currently" to "high" with the average replacement rate of the size of ~10-4 per year per stroke, depending on the phase of the CoV adaptation towards the new funds.
CoV has exoribonuclease orthogonal, elimination that results in very high mutations, attenuation, or even inviability.
Interestingly, Remdesivir's nucleotide analogue was known to suppress coV replication through the inhibition of this exoribunuclease and RNA polymerase dependent on RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-COV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
Even so, the CoV mutation rate is about a million times higher than the average mutation rate.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when the CoV has not yet been adapted to the cold.
Compared to the SARS-COV that has a high mutation rate, the SARS-COV-2 mutation rate is actually lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation with humans.
Probably SARS-COV-2 has been adapted to other materials that are close to humans.
In addition to SARS-COV-2, this also happens on the Mers-COV that has been designed with Arab eggs.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic degradation will quickly make the vaccine and antivirus agent against SARS-COV-2 ineffective.
Secondly, the large RNA genome in the CoV provides extra flexibility in the modification of the genome, for mutation and recombination, so as to increase the probability of co-evolution of the interspecies, which benefits the emergence of the new CoV when appropriate.
This is supported by many unique open-ended reading lines and protein functions at the end of the 3′ genome.
Third, CoV often replaces random templates during RNA replication through the unique "choice-choice" mechanism.
In a tube that functions as a mixing vessel, a change in turn occurs frequently during the transcription of the RNA CoV.
Complete and subgenomic RNAs that are very homologous can be recombined to form a new COV.
Philogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCV-HKU1 and HCV-OC43, as well as in animals such as SL-COV and COV-HKU9.
Virus interaction in its connection with transmission
In addition to the three factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the fungi receptor is another major factor that affects interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is considered a special example, which also shows positive selection during the interspecies transmission.
Based on a comparative analysis of human SARS-CoV isolates and fertilisers, SARS-CoV is expected to undergo rapid adaptations in various ways, especially with mutations to RBD protein S.
In general, RBD protein S CoV interacts with the cell receptor and intensively becomes a target of mild antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is the amino acid to 318 to 510 in the S1 segment, which is related to ACE2 humans and its correspondor as the way into the virus.
RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to identify ACE2 receptors of various animals, which include bats, mice, rats, and dogs, so that they can transmit interspecies viruses.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues observed differently between human virus isolates and implanted in RBD and 4 of them are located on the basis of the receptor binding to interact with the ACE2 receptor.
SARS-CoV is installed with K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may increase the affinity of the protein tones with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be very important for adapting the virus to humans.
It must be noted that SARS-COV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-COV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein S unit involves the affinity of protein S binding to ACE2 human potential has changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study shows the affinity between human ACE2 binding and S SARS-COV-2 protein 10 to 20 times higher than the affinity between human ACE2 and S SARS-COV protein.
The important thing is to know if there's any other corps that might be needed for the SARS-COV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HCOV-NL63 is also related to ACE2, but to the different parts of S.
There are many other HCV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCOV-229E and 9-O-terase titration for HCOV-OC43.
These receptors may also play a role in the success of this COV adaptation in humans after the transmission of the interspecies from the animal feed.
In addition to the cell receptor, the end result of the HCOV interspecies transmission is also arranged by other factors of dependence and other economic constraints.
The difference between humans and nature reserves, such as bats, Arab eggs, and predators, can be an obstacle to interspecies transmission.
HCOV has to take over the factor of financial dependence and inhibit the factor of financial limitation to succeed in interspecies transmission.
In this case, a molecular sensor in the field of viral interaction is still needed to be identified and created.
The entire genome is unusually observatories to see the dependence and financial constraints of SARS-COV-2 using the highest CRISPR technology may be useful.
New HCOV appears: back to the beginning of the plague
COV's doubts gave the audience a great chance to see a new HCOV.
In this case, the COV valve functions as the HCV gene lung.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recombination also stimulate the evolution of HCV and function as two important steps in this process.
For example, the release or loss of a gene from a new protein may dramatically alter the phenotype of the virus.
Among the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is expected to play an important role in human adaptation because the virus related to SARS-CoV virus isolated was found to alter the range of ORF8 proteins.
SARS-CoV with a special feature of the elimination of 29 nucleotide was found on an insulated strain at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is expected to be adaptive mutation that supports cheap change.
In addition, SARS-COV may have a recombination history with alpha-COV and gamma-COV line, with a large number of smaller recombination areas identified in RNA polymerase dependent on RNA.
The recombination location is also identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and some nsp14.
Similarly, the recombination between the various offspring lines is shown in the Mers-CoV epidemic, which took place in the Arab oats in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination has also been observed in other HCVs where HCV has been recombined with other coV animals in its non-structural genes.
Also, it should be noted that make-up selection can play a role in unexpected changes to the viral genome, most likely due to the release of the virus from the chosen pressure, such as the immune system.
This effect example is the loss of ORF4 complete on the HCV-229E prototype strain due to the deletion of two nucleotides.
While the whole ORF4 can be seen on the cervical virus and eggs that are close to HCV-229E, alpha-CoV alpaca shows a single nucleotide sieve that results in a chain movement.
Finally, new HCOV evolution was also driven by the selection pressure in its reservoir feed.
Mild or undetected symptoms when coV is infected, which show adaptations between CoV and the coV.
It seems that the stars are well adapted to the coV anatomically and physiologically.
For example, deficiency in the activation of the proinflammatory response to bats will result in an efficient reduction in the pathology of COV.
In addition, the activity of the natural killer cell on the bats was forced by increasing the regulation of the natural killer cell receptors of the NKG2/CD94 and the level of expression of the primary class I histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high rate of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from high-level metabolic activity can suppress coV replication and influence exoribonuclease absorption so that it gives the selection pressure to create a highly pathogenic strain virus when entering the new vein.
The more pathogenical strain CoV may also develop through recombination, which results in protein binding or new protein function to adapt.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three new HCVs have appeared in the last two sources.
CoV is non-pathogenic or causes mild symptoms in its reservoir, such as paralysis and oats.
CoV replication strongly without triggering a strong immune response.
This is where there is a secret carrier without symptoms and the cause of a serious human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the activation of excessive immune response and stokine storms, with more severe lung damage if immune response is increased.
On the other hand, the immune response of the undiagnosed carrier has been eliminated from the coV replication.
The same strategy to determine the immune response relationship may be useful in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon's response is particularly strong on the stars.
That's why, I-type interferons, at least in the early phase of SARS-COV-2 infection on humans, should be useful.
In addition, the inflammatory activation of NLRP3 in the defective limbs.
For this reason, the inflammatory inhibition of NLRP3 with MCC950 may benefit from COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-COV-2 follows the general trend of SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
While a 95% nucleotide homologous to SARS-CoV has been found, there are 96% nucleotide homologous to SARS-CoV-2.
Although insects and other animals on the market were found to have a virus identical to SARS-CoV, no direct link to SARS-CoV-2 was found.
Beta-CoV calling that is very homologous with SARS-COV-2 has been found, which shows that the call may be one of the intermediations or beta-COV calling may give a gene fragment contribution to the final version of SARS-COV-2.
Although still questioned, there is no evidence that SARS-COV-2 is deliberately or unintentionally made by humans.
CoV's back to focus on SARS-COV-2 disease recently.
CoV studies in animals and animals have changed our perceptions of the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reserves for HCOV on human transmission.
A lot of evidence shows that SARS-COV, MERCS-COV, and SARS-COV-2 come from the blind and are transmitted to humans through the media.
Remembering that SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between humans and insects in the wet market, maybe the closure of the wet market and the killing of all insects in it that effectively ends the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, the call should have been moved from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmissions, bearing in mind that there are some beta-coV lines of call that are close to SARS-coV-2.
However, the truth and the SARS-COV-2 mechanism were transmitted to humans through calls and other mammarys still need to be declared in future research.
On the other hand, Mers-CoV has been in Arabic for a long time.
It functions as an important transport tool and as a main source of meat, milk, skin, and wool products for local communities.
Arab eggs spread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
That's why we can't kill all the eggs to control the MRS, as did in the wild animal market in Tiongkok to prevent SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2.
In order to stop the MERS disease, a comprehensible approach must be made to develop vaccines for effective eggs against MERS-CoV and combined with other infection control steps.
Before we can eliminate this virus, a new genotype can develop and cause disease.
Various zoonotic coVs go into the wild.
Especially, the cov of a bird with zoonotic potential is very different.
There are a lot of possibilities for this zoonotic coV to evolve and experience recombination, which results in a new coV that is easier to transmit and/or more lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in Tiongkok has to be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With experience of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, preparation and better recovery plans should be implemented.
In fact, many viruses have existed on this planet ever since.
These viruses are in their natural reservoirs until there is a chance to preach.
Although the wild beast has many features that support the preaching of the good news, man’s prospects for contact with the wild beast and other species can be minimized if humans are trained to avoid wild animals.
Monitoring of mammals needs to be done to understand more about the ecological and natural environment, which will prove beneficial in preventing the transmission of animals and the coming disease.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent zoonosis virus is for humans to keep a distance from the ecological reserve of the natural reserve of the zoonotic virus.
Some of the problems of the original SARS-COV-2 zoonotic parts have not been found.
First, if the bat transmits the SARS-COV-2 viral to the call, the condition when the bat and the call share the ecological relay is an important thing to know.
Second, if the bats have a more direct role in transmitting to humans, how human contact with the bats must be determined.
Third, if there is a third breast that plays a role as an interstellar, the way the breast interacts with other species, which includes humans, blinds, and calls should be clarified.
Finally, because many mammals, including pets that may be vulnerable to SARS-COV-2, well test infection and surveillance should be done.
I don't know if the monster, the alarm, or other mammals, is expected to have a SARS-COV-2 or its primary virus that's almost identical to its natural origins in the future.
Exploration research in this field will evaluate the evolution of SARS-COV-2 in animals, with an important involvement in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
The modification of the diagnostic criteria "suspected case" and "confirmed case" COVID-19 need to be done
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick advice guide for the diagnosis and management of new coronation virus 2019 (2019-nCOV).
However, coronation virus 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our consciousness and knowledge are increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnostic and management strategies are also being updated.
In this letter, we responded to one of the comments on our guidance and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for the "suspected case" and "confirmed case" based on the Diagnostics and Management Manual for COVID-19 (Seventh version) issued by the National Health Commission of the Republic of Tiongkok.
In December 2019, the new coronation virus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused a disease, which is currently formally referred to as coronation virus 2019 (COVID-19) and has been named coronation virus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO explained COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed rapid advice guidelines and the guidance has been published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has been a very interesting guide since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our consciousness and knowledge are increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical practical experience; therefore, diagnostic and management strategies are also being updated.
For example, the Diagnostics and Management Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the Republic of Tiongkok (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, this Commission has issued a total of seven editions with some of the context changed quite a lot.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al., who introduced the offer of a simple score based on their clinical experience.
Their work added new evidence to our guidance and proved to be a valuable reference to this worldwide brotherhood.
We supported their meaningful work and expressed our gratitude to Jehovah.
Nevertheless, their work also requires a modification based on the Diagnostics and Management Guidelines for the latest COVID-19 (Seventh Trial version) and the latest study.
On the basis of the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the suspected case, a combination of one of the epidemiology stories with two clinical manifestations is required to make a comprehensive analysis, or to remove three clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) travel history or residence in Wuhan and its surroundings, or other community where the COVID-19 case has been reported in the last 14 days prior to the symptom update; (2) contact history with the case of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleate tests); (3) contact history with patients suffering from fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and its surroundings, or other community where the COVID-19 case has been reported in the last 14 days prior to the symptom update; (4) contact history with the confirmed case cluster (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in a small area, such as home, office, school, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) COVID-19 infection spectrometry; (3) total white blood cell counts show normal lymphocyte count, down, or decreased at the early stage of recovery.
The diagnosis of confirmed cases should be based on a suspected case with one of the pathogens or serological evidence as follows: (1) PCR real-time positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the full sequence of viruses shows high homogeneity for known new coronary viruses; (3) positive for specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum tests; or change of specific IgG-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from negative to positive, or a titer increase ≥4 fold in the recovery phase above the rate at acute stage.
We can see that real-time nuclear asthma PCR tests in the breath or bloodstream sample are added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic detection on a blood sample was added to the fourth (January 27, 2020) and the fifth (February 8, 2020); then, serological evidence was added to the seventh.
This modification is based on a survey conducted by researchers to find the optimal nitrogen detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as a sample of the respiratory tract including blood intake, which enhances the availability of various species, and supports the incorporation of certain positive antibody results into the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is more evidence that reminds us to guard against a patient with atypical and unsymptomised symptoms.
That's why the Zhou et al. loops have to be updated because they classify people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The system of scoreboards also needs to be verified in practice and clinical studies in the near future.
As a conclusion, we looked forward to more direct evidence to appear and asked readers to comment.
To diagnose "suspected case" and "confirmed case", we suggest that we follow and follow the latest guidelines in each country.
Our team will also periodically update our guidance as well.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest daily death rate
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on that day.
This is the highest death rate in one day of the virus.
Until yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) Bangladesh reported a recorded number of infections involving 114 active cases and 33 homesickness cases.
Recorded a total of 17 deaths.
In a headline, IEDCR director Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora said death included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases over 60 years old, two cases between 51 and 60 years old, and one case between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said two victims came from Dhaka.
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a hostage.
A hospital office told Anadolu Agency, a local news office, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, Director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was maintained at the Kuwaiti Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in a live video announcement, the Minister of Road and Bridge Transport, Obaidul Quadr said public transport would be stopped longer than planned until Saturday comes.
This public transport stop began on March 26, and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transporting supplies of wood -- medicine, fuel, and food -- is still permitted.
The first COVID-19 infection incident reported in Bangladesh was on March 8th, on two newly returned from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
On March 19, the three men were healed.
SARS-COV-2 infection is more than one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of SARS-COV-2 coronal virus infections exceeds one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 thousand deaths are related to COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronal virus.
Its peak occurred the same day when Malawi confirmed the infection of its first coronal virus and Zambia had its first death related to the coronal virus.
North Korea claims, on Thursday, that the country is one of the few countries that remain free of coroner virus infection.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1,05,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours since 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4th.
In the United States, more than 244 thousand cases of coronal virus have been reported, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
The CBS News Office, which posted data from Johns Hopkins University, reported more than 1,000 deaths in the United States caused by coronary virus infection.
Throughout the world, countries have announced more stringent measures to stop the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the quarantine period until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin said that the Russians would remain paid without having to go to work until April 30th.
The Portuguese Parliament took a hearing to extend the national emergency status for 15 days; it escaped with 215 supporting voices, ten abstinent voices, and one voice rejected.
Saudi Arabia lengthens the hours of the night in the holy cities of Mecca and Medinah until the whole day; earlier, the night ended only between three o’clock in the morning and six o’clock in the morning.
Thailand plans to apply an hour of night between 10 p.m. and 4 p.m.
Governor Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the country of that part had extended the order to stay at home until May 1.
Shops in Australia lower the purchase limit of toilet cloth per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australia Woolworth and College's retail network each lowered the purchase limit of toilet linen to two and a gentleman per transaction in all shops at the national level.
ALDI applied the limit of one sir on Monday.
These restrictions were published as messages on the Internet’s website and on the Internet.
The buyers are reported to be preparing for the fear of COVID-19 if the society has to do a toilet insulation.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet towels for shipments to the house up to one pack per order.
This change follows the limitations of four gentlemen per transaction previously applied to Woolworths and Colleges each on 4 and 5 March.
In his statement on March 8th, Coles reported that by performing the restrictions on the four of them, "many stores have been gone in an hour since delivery", and the request was called "never before", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unforeseeable".
The sale of "fast rise" last week, according to one of Woolworth's professors.
Costco shop in Canberra also limits the number allowed up to two hours ago.
To avoid overcrowding, Coles ordered larger packages than cookers and increased delivery frequencies, Woolworths ordered additional supplies, while ALDI made preparations for special Rabu promotion activities available earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Peritel Association, said that the peritel tried to increase the supply, but the local government's limits for the time of truck delivery made it difficult.
He anticipates rising production costs, while the cook is trying to meet demand, and less special promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that because of the early release of supplies, some stores could not hold a special Wednesday.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a rite expert at Queensland University of Technology, said the store fills every night.
He stressed that toilet cloth was a large item so that the quantity of supplies was low and, if it was sold out, made many empty spaces in the racks so that the collapse of the goods was growing.
Coles and Woolworths feel [that] if there's a lot of stuff on the shelf, if products like toilet cloth and sanitation get [bought] and there's a lot of danger, it might be minimized, raining Russell Zimmerman through the ABC News Office.
Who Gives a Crap's golden toilet producer said last Wednesday that they're out of supplies.
Kimberly-Clark, who made Tissue Toilet Kleinex, and Solaris Paper, who made Sorbent, pressured them to work 24/7 to keep the market, according to News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reports that some property vendors offer free toilet linen to the first caterpillar in Melbourne, when it's less slow because the buyer takes the ticket to the weekend holiday.
Thursday’s NT News, a day published in Darwin, announces eight Web pages that are meant to be cut and used as toilet cloth.
The real stores refused to apply the restrictions, according to the ABC Australia report on March 3rd, they said they did not plan to apply the purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, sanitation, dry food, soap washers, and flour.
Similarly, on Sunday afternoon, British Oceano’s online supermarket was observed limiting the purchase of Andres’s toilet linen to two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization (WHO) says COVID-19 as a hostage
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that a COVID-19 disease is happening—a disease caused by SARS-COV-2 coronation—as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemi" only complains about how far the disease has spread, not how dangerous the case is, the WHO notes the need to motivate the government to act:
All countries still have the ability to change their pantheon.
If the country detects, tests, manages, isolates, and mobilizes its people as a response, consider Theodores Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of WHO.
We were well - aware of the extent to which we preached and the extent to which we were concerned.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Center for Control and Prevention of Disease, this pandemic "has never happened before."
He said, in a note published by CNN in February, "except for influenza, there are no respiratory viruses ever tracked from its emergence to the global preaching that is shocking."
Gebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying, "We have never seen a pandemic that was cut by the coronation virus."
He continues, "and we've never seen a pandemy that can be controlled at the same time."
The new state of mind follows the WHO decision in January, which states this plague as an influx of society’s ill health.
Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about this disease, "It's going to get worse."
By Friday, Associated Press reported at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
Pandemi koronavirus 2019-2020 is pandemi koronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) which is continuing and due to acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
The plague was identified in Wuhan, Tiongkok, in December 2019 as a World Health Organization on January 30, 2020, and was declared a hostage on March 11, 2020.
Until 10 April 2020, about 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territorial areas, resulting in some 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 people have been healed.
The case fatality figure is estimated at 4% in Tiongkok, while the world's peaks range from 13.04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, itching, and breathing.
Complication can include pneumonia and acute respiratory syndrome.
From the dawn of the day to the wake of the symptoms in general, some five days may begin with a period of between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antivirus treatment.
The main care is symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recommended preventive action involves washing hands, closing mouth when ingested, keeping away from others, and monitoring and insulating people who are expected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing restrictions on travel, quarantine, nighttime, workplace hazard management, and facility closures.
This pandemic has led to a severe global economic downturn, the postponement or cancellation of cultural, political, religious, social, and social activities, as well as the spread of the market for things that have been marred by panic buying.
Schools and universities have been well funded at both the national and local levels in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the population of students worldwide.
Misinformation about this virus has spread online and there are incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against the Tionghoa people, people with the offspring and appearance of East and South Asia, and people from the area with a significant virus case.
As a result of traffic congestion and heavy industrial closures, air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, Tiongkok (Hubei province) report a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown causes on December 31, 2019 and research carried out in early January 2020.
These cases are largely related to the Great Sea Food Market and therefore the virus is expected to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that causes the disease is called SARS-COV-2, a virus that has recently been detected and is closely related to the coronation of the vertebral cord, the coronation virus, and SARS-COV. The first person with symptoms was later known to fall ill on December 1, 2019, and the person has no clear link with the later mentioned wet market cluster.
Among the initial case cluster reported in December 2019, two thirds were related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, a report not yet verified by South China Morning Post estimated that a case that could be investigated on 17 November 2019, at a 55-year-old age from Hubei Province, was likely the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, with a new case reported down in Tiongkok, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside Tiongkok had exceeded the number of new cases in Tiongkok for the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
Until February 26, relatively few cases reported among young people, with 19-year-olds under the age of 2.4% of cases worldwide, are estimated by UK science adviser Patrick Vallance to have 60 percent of the British population to be infected before group violence can be achieved.
The case has been sued on the number of people who have tested COVID-19 and whose test results have been confirmed positively in accordance with the official protocol.
Until March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made official policies to avoid testing people with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in Tiongkok, until January 23, 86% of COVID-19 infection was not detected, and that this undocumented infection was a source of infection for 79% of the documented case.
A statistical analysis published on March 30th estimated that the number of infections in Italy was estimated to be greater than the reported cases.
The initial estimate of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the figure was probably 5.7.
Most of the COVID-19's suffering is healed.
For those who are not healed, the period from the onset of symptoms to the death of between 6 and 41 days, with the most common 14 days.
Since 10 April 2020, about 97,000 deaths have been associated with COVID-19.
In Tiongkok, until February 5, about 80% of the deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age and 75% had a previous health disorder, which included cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
The number of fatalities actually caused by COVID-19 may be much higher, bearing in mind the official number of chances of not telling people who died without testing, for example, at home, at the nursing home, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death count by 4-5 times.
A female therapist for the U.S. Center for Control and Prevention of Disease (CDC) admits, "We know [the number of deaths reported] is lower than the actual number," a statement reinforced by an unintended report about the too low count in the U.S.. The too low count often occurs in the pancreas, as in the H1N1 flu epidemic 2009. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside of Tionkok took place on February 1, in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
Until February 28, out of Tionkok land, more than a dozen deaths were recorded each in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
Until March 13, more than 40 countries and territories have reported deaths, in every continent, except Antarctica, and in general some measurements have been used to calculate mortality.
This number varies from region to region and over time, and is influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, the management options, the time since the first disease, and the character of populations such as age, type of pregnancy, and overall health.
According to statistics by Johns Hopkins University, the death rate for the overall case is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) on 10 April 2020.
This number varies according to the region.
In Tiongkok, the death rate estimate for the case falls from 17.3% (for people with symptoms 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with symptoms after 1 February 2020).Other estimates include the number of fatalities (CFR), reflecting the percentage of the diagnosed people who died from certain diseases, and the number of infectious fatalities (IFR), reflecting the percentage of those who died from certain diseases (diagnosis and non-diagnosis).
These statistics are timeless and follow a particular population from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to count these numbers for a particular population.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine University of Oxford estimates the number of infectious fatalities for pandemics in total between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper limit of this estimate is consistent with the results of the first random test for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical analysis that analyzes the impact of the test on CFR.
WHO insists that this pandemic can be controlled.
The peaks and the end of this plague are unclear and may vary according to location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University said: "Without control, the disease usually settles and then begins to fall when the disease is gone.
But it's almost impossible to make reasonable projections at this point about when it's going to happen."
Senior medical advisor to the government of Tiongkok Zhong Nanshan believes that "this may end in June" if the entire country can be mobilized to follow WHO's advice on steps to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine said that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to leave, possibly for one or two years."
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical and other steps will be required "to make the vaccine available (probably 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it's unlikely that this coronation virus, because it's very easy to transmit, can disappear completely" and this disease "may turn into seasonal disease, which returns every year."
Revolving virulence will depend on group violence and mutation levels.
The COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively non-specific and the infected can be without symptoms.
Two of the most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
The symptoms that are less common include fatigue, the production of respiratory spasms (flemma), the loss of the ability to breathe, the breathing, the pancreas and the muscles, the throat, the headache, the hives, the vomiting, the hemoptysis, the diarrhea, or the sinosis. WHO notes that about one in six people becomes severe and has difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stimulates emergency symptoms including difficulty breathing, chest tightness or chest tightness, sudden confusion, difficulty walking, and nausea in the face and mouth; medical attention is advised if these symptoms occur. Further disease can be severe pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, sepsis, and death.
Some infected people may be asymptomatic, i.e. without clinical symptoms, but with test results confirming the infection, therefore, the researchers suggest that those who contact the confirmed infected should be closely monitored and tested to ensure that they are not infected.
The Tionghoa people estimate asymptomatic ratios ranging from a few to 44%.
Incubation periods (when between infections and symptoms) usually range between 1 and 14 days, most often 5 days. For example, uncertainty is the estimate of the number of COVID-19 sufferings that lost its original 30%, and then decreased to 15%.
Details of how the disease is spreading are still being examined.
The COVID-19 preaching is mainly believed to take place during close contact and through a small droplet produced when wet, saturate, or speak; close contact is a contact within a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
The study found that unscrewed can cause a drop of 4.5 meters (15 feet) to up to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some researchers estimate viruses may also be released by a small droplet that lasts longer in the air and is produced when talking. Respiratory droplets can also be produced when breathing, including when talking, although this virus generally does not flow through the air.
The droplets can fall into the mouth or nose of a person close to him or perhaps fall into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as the intubation and resuscitation of the lung (RJP), can turn the respiratory secret into an aerosol and spread through the air.
The preaching work can also take place when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, then touches the eyes, the nose, and the mouth.
While there is concern that the virus can spread through the faeces, the risk is low.
The Tiongkok government is able to transmit SARS-COV-2 orally.The virus is the most prevalent in the first three days after the symptoms, although the preaching may take place before the symptoms appear and at a further stage of disease.
People give positive test results up to three days before symptoms are resolved, which indicate transmission may occur before significant symptoms occur.
Only a few reports of an asymptomatic case confirmed by the laboratory, but the asymptomatic discharges have been identified by some countries in the investigation of contact transmissions.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said that although it is not clear how easy this disease is to spread, one person in general is infected by two to three others.
In particular, it has been found that the virus can be detected for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and hard coal 304, one day in cardboard, and more than four hours in copper.
However, this varies depending on the humidity and temperature, and other pets have been tested for positive COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can spread the virus to humans, although the English authorities suggest washing their hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with the surface that may have touched the infected person.
Coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three pneumonia patients associated with acute respiratory disease cluster in Wuhan.
All types of SARS-COV-2 virus are related to the coronation virus in the natural world. Outside the human body, this virus can be destroyed if it has a home soap, which provides a protective envelope.
The virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis reveals that the coronation virus is genetically classified with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgens of Sarbecovirus (the offspring line B) together with two offspring of monkeys.
This virus has a 96% similarity to the entire genome level with another cervical coronation virus sample (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, a study by Tionghoa found that there was only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the sequential genome between the calling virus and the human virus.
So far, the comparison of the whole genome found the most common 92% of the genetic harmony between the coronation virus and the SARS-COV-2, not enough to prove that the call is the essence of the SARS-COV-2.
Virus infection can be temporarily diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, but confirmation was finally made through the reverse transcription chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to the infected secret or CT irritant.
A comparative study between PCR and CT in Wuhan shows that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with a lot of puncture physiques with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "CT must not be used for writing or as the first line test in COVID-19 diagnostics."
WHO has published some RNA test protocols for SARS-COV-2, first released on January 17th.
Test using real-time polymerase transcription chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Tests can be performed on a sample of breathing or blood.
The results are generally available within a few hours to a few days.
In general, this test is performed on a nasopharyngeal tube, but it can also be used by a number of laboratories and companies that are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
On April 6, 2020, not one of these serological tests proved to be accurate enough to accept its use widely.
In the U.S., the serological tests developed by Cellex have been approved for emergency use, only by a certified laboratory.
The characteristics of radiography and tomography are compiled (CT) in people with symptomatic resistance to ground glass asymmetry and no pleural effusion.
Italian Radiological Society is setting up an international online database to find insights into the confirmed case.
Because of tingling with other infections such as adenovirus, PCR-free irritants have limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A major study in Tiongkok compared CT chest results with PCR and showed that although less specific for infection, filtration is faster and more sensitive so it is recommended to be considered as an epidemiology device.
The neural convolution network based on built-in intelligence has been developed to detect viral fibrillation fibrillation with radiography and CT.
A strategy to prevent the spread of the disease involves caring for good personal hygiene in a compassionate manner, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth before washing hands, and wearing tissue when wet or wetting, and throwing the tissue directly into the trash.
People who may have been infected are advised to wear a knife mask in public places.
The physical restrictions are also recommended to prevent leakage, and governments in various areas have restricted or forced them to stop all non-essential journeys to and from countries and regions affected by the disease.
However, the virus has reached a global scale in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus has spread in society, and some members of society don't know where or how they're infected.
The use of location data from the government's cell phones for this purpose has led to privacy problems, with statements issued by Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations calling for this kind of surveillance.
Various cellular applications have been implemented or initiated to be used voluntarily, and on 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record the proximity of the user to another phone.
In addition, users will receive a message if they are close to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.
There isn't a COVID-19 vaccine yet, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Wash your hands in order to prevent disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after the toilet or when the hands are dirty; before eating; and after brushing their nose, throat, or lips.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus was killed by a greenhouse that damaged its protective layer.
Further, the CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based handicraft with at least 60% alcohol-based volumes when soap and water are not available.
WHO encourages people not to touch their eyes, nose, or mouth before washing their hands.
The surface can be decontaminated using a number of currents (in one minute infested for a low-fat surface), including ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide 0.5%, and povidone-iodine 0.2–7.5%.
Other pathways, such as benzalkonium chloride and gluconate chloride, are less effective.
CDC recommends that if COVID cases are expected or confirmed in public facilities, such as offices or childcare facilities, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, public areas, electronic devices together such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote control, and ATM machines used by suffering, should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouths and nose with chewing gums or use tissues when they are sneezing or chewing, and then immediately discard the tissues.
Medical masks are recommended for people who may have been infected because wearing masks can limit the volume and length of expiratory droplets that are widely spoken, saturated, and swollen.
WHO has issued instructions on time and how to dress masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "The use of masks can reduce people's tendency to touch their face with a clean hand, which is the main source of circulation."The mask is also recommended for use by people who may be caring for this disease.
WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who care for COVID-19, although WHO also admits that wearing masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have begun to promote the use of masks to members of society.
In the U.S., CDC recommends the use of a non-medicine face mask made of cloth. It specifically recommends the use of a medical mask to a healthy society, especially when approaching (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask when using public transportation or living in many places.
Thailand’s health officials encouraged people to make house - to - house masks and wash them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia forbid the public to go out in public without wearing masks or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear a face mask when going to the public to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has arranged for every person who enters a gun to wear a face mask.
Israel asked all its citizens to wear a face mask while in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since the middle of March, has forced railway passengers and intercity buses to wear a face mask on April 1.
Panama requires the use of facial masks every time outside the house, and recommends making your own facial masks for those who can't buy facial masks.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social exclusion (also called physical limitation) is an action to control infection that involves slowing down the preaching of the good news by minimizing contact between individuals.
Social restraints include quarantine; travel restrictions; and school closures, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or financial centers.
People can apply social restraints by staying at home, by limiting their travels, by avoiding many areas, by using social networking sites, and by keeping their physical distance from others.
At present, many governments are forced or forced to impose social restraints in the most vulnerable areas of the world.
The maximum number of people who are recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organizations is rapidly reduced, starting from 250 people (if there's a COVID-19 month in one region) to 50 people, and then 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany prohibited meetings in public areas involving more than two people.
The use of the term "social exclusion" has the effect that people have to isolate themselves completely socially and do not induce people to stay in contact with others in alternative ways.
This recommendation covers the urge to have sex only with people who live with you and who do not have a virus or virus symptom.
Insulation at home is recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and those expected to be infected.
Health authorities have issued detailed instructions for proper mansion isolation. Many governments require or recommend quarantine for the entire population living in the most affected area.
The quarantine instructions are most strictly issued for people who include high-risk groups.
People who may be exposed to the suffering of COVID-19 and those who have recently moved to a country or region with the extensive COVID-19 preaching that is recommended to do quarantine during the 14 days since the last vacation.
The strategy for controlling the disease is confusion or depression, as well as mediation.
Controversy was done at the early stages of the disease and aimed at tracking and insulating the infected and taking other steps to control the infection and vaccination aimed at stopping the spread of the disease throughout the population.
When it is no longer possible to stop the preaching work, try to shift it to a mitigation stage: these steps are taken to slow down the preaching work and reduce its impact on the health and social systems.
The combination of the decoupling and the mitigation action can be done at the same time.
Suffocation requires more extreme steps to reverse the pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproductions to less than 1. Part of the control of foot-and-mouth disease is to try to lower the epidemic peak, which is known by identifying the epidemic curve.
This lowers the risk of overindulgence in health care and provides more time for the development of vaccines and medications.
Non-pharmaceutical intervention to deal with the plague includes individual prevention actions, such as hand cleaning, facial masking, and toilet quarantine; steps at the level of society intended for physical limitation, such as closing schools and canceling mass meeting events; public involvement to incite reception and participation in such interventions; and steps at the level of the environment, such as surface cleaning. Other drastic actions aimed at preventing the disease in Tiongkok when the disaster becomes more real, such as warning the whole of the city and committing severe travel bans.
Other countries also apply various steps aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduces local mass and quarantine visitors, and warns about the movements of infected people.
Singapore provides financial support for the most infected people who do quarantine and carry large sentences for those who fail to do so.
Taiwan increases the production of facial masks and penalizes the growth of medical supplies. Simulations for England and the United States show that migraine (slow but not halting the preaching of the epidemic) and oppression (returning epidemic growth) have great challenges.
Optimum mitigation policies can reduce demand peaks for health care to 2/3 and death to half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and poor health systems.
Suffocation can be chosen, but it needs to be maintained as long as the virus continues to spread to the human population (or until the vaccine is available, if this is the first one achieved), because if not, the swelling will rapidly resuscitation when the suffocation is controlled.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has had an impact on the social and economic situation.
There is no specific antivirus drug approved for COVID-19, but the development effort is being carried out, which includes an existing drug test.
Taking in flu drugs that are sold free, drinking enough water, and rest can help to relieve symptoms.
Depending on the level of degradation, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be needed.
The use of steroids can worsen the patient’s condition.
Some of the lives previously approved for the treatment of other virus diseases are being examined for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also states that some "traditional and domestic governance" can reduce symptoms caused by SARS-COV-19.
WHO says that increasing capacity and adapting health care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 is a basic step in responding to the disease.
The ECDC and the WHO regional European offices have issued guidance for primary hospitals and health services to divert resources at various levels, including focus on laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, if it is possible to cancel electrical procedures, to separate and isolate positive patients with COVID-19, and to increase the capacity for intensive care by training staff and increasing the number of fans and sleeping places.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (which is called the patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronation virus can be traced to the date of 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, Tiongkok.
In one month, the number of cases of coronation in Hubei increased gradually.
These cases are mostly related to the Great Sea Food Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory says that the virus comes from one of these species; or, in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin. A pneumonia cluster with unknown cause was observed on December 26 and was handled by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei's Hospital, which informed the CDC Jianghan Wuhan on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Center Hospital told their colleagues about the SARS-like coronavirus.
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false villages, and others, Ai Fen, were advised by his superior because of the warning he issued.
The Wuhan City Health Commission then issued an announcement to the public on December 31st and informed WHO.
Quite a number of unknown pneumonia cases have been reported to health authorities in Wuhan who then launched an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the disease, the number of cases increased twice every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of Tiongkok, supported by migration during the New Imlek Year and because Wuhan is the transport center and main railway transit.
On January 20, Tiongkok reported nearly 140 new cases a day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The following official data show that 6,174 people have experienced symptoms on 20 January 2020.On 26 March, the United States has exceeded Tiongkok and Italy with the highest confirmed cases in the world. By 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died worldwide and more than 364,000 have been healed.
About 200 countries and territorial areas have at least one case.
Because of the pantheon in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area restrict free movement and make border controls.

The Tiongkok government received criticism from the United States, the British Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, and the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, over the initial panda management in the province of Hubei, Tiongkok.
A number of governors of the Province of the Communist Party of Tiongkok (CPC) ceased to be involved in the quarantine effort in the Middle Tiongkok, which is a sign of dissatisfaction with the political authorities' response to the plague in the region.
Some commentators believe that this step is meant to protect the Secretary-General of the Communist Party Tiongkok Xi Jinping from public wrath related to coronary disease.
Some Tionkok offices, such as Zhao Lijian, refused prior recognition of the early coronation virus disease in Wuhan, and supported conspiracy theory about COVID-19 came from the US or Italy.
The U.S. Governor Donald Trump called the coronation virus "Tionkok virus" or " Wuhan virus" and said that "the covert action of Tionkok gives power to a virus that now turns into a global pandemic." This word was eventually criticized by a number of critics as racism and "debatting from his government's failure to deal with the coronation virus."
The Daily Beast received a message from the U.S. government that outlined the communication strategy and clearly came from the National Security Council, with the strategy being quoted as "All about Tiongkok.
We were told to try and deliver this message in whatever way possible, including press conferences and television shows."Media such as Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg claimed that Tiongkok's efforts to send assistance to the countries affected by the virus are part of a campaign to influence the world.
The head of foreign policy in the European Union, Josep Borrell, warns that there are "geo-political components, which cover battles to be influenced by the exchange of facts and "the policy of generosity."
Borrell also said that, "Tigkok aggressively motivates the message that, unlike the United States, they are responsible and dependable friends."
Tiongkok also urged the U.S. to lift the sanctions against Syria, Venezuela, and Iran and to send assistance to the last two countries.
Jack Ma's donation was 100,000 masks for Cuba blocked by US sanctions on 3 April.
The U.S. authorities were also accused of depriving other countries of their own assistance.
There are other associated masks reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria, and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey takes hundreds of fans for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian government criticised the lack of European solidarity with Italy's most common coronation virus.
Maurizio Massari, the Italian ambassador to the European Union, said that "Only Tiongkok responded bilaterally.
Of course, this is not a sign of good European solidarity."
On March 22, after receiving a phone call from the Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin handed over Russian troops to send military forces, vehicles that were specifically infected, and other medical devices to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted "high-level political sources" anonymously as saying that 80 percent of Russia's aid "was useless or of little use to Italy."
The source accused Russia of making a "geopolitical and diplomatic" attack.
President Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and Foreign Minister Luigi In Mayo ignored the media report and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent cargo planes with medical help to the United States.
Professor Kremlin Dmitry Peskov said that "when offering help to colleagues in the U.S., [Putin] assumes that if the U.S. hardware manufacturer and medical material get the chance, they will also be able to repay if necessary."
NATO military training "Defender 2020" planned in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic States, the largest NATO war training since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a smaller scale.
Secretary-General of the Nuclear Exploitation Campaign Kate Hudson criticised the Defender 2020 training: "In the current public health crisis, this training not only endangers the lives of the U.S. military and many participating European countries, but also the people of the country where they operate."The Iranian government is very heavy on this virus, with about two dozen members of parliament infected as well as fifteen politicians at or before.
On March 14, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help and said that his country was struggling with disease because it lacked access to the international market as a result of United States sanctions on Iran.
Political analysis considers that this may appear negative on Donald Trump's chance to be re-elected in the 2020 presidential election. The diplomatic relationship between Japan and South Korea has deteriorated as a result of this pandemic.
South Korea criticises "the ambiguous and passive Japanese quarantine effort" after Japan announces that every person coming from South Korea will be placed in two weeks' quarantine at the government's designated location.
Initially, South Korea's public view is shared about President Moon Jae-in's response to this crisis.
Many Koreans are signing petitiones, calling for Moon's release, on the basis of their claim of government error in dealing with the plague, and commending its response.
Some commentators express concern that this may enable the government to strengthen its powerlessness.
In Hungary, his parliament chose to allow the Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, to rule through a timeless decree, delay parliament and public elections, and punish those deemed to be spreading false information about the virus and crisis management by the government.
Coronavirus disease has been isolated from the lack of market, resulting from an increase in the use of equipment globally to fight disease, buy because of panic, and disruption of factory and logistics operations.
The U.S. Drug and Food Agency issued a warning about drug shortages and medical devices as it increased consumer demand and eating disorders.
Some areas also suffer from panic that results in a lack of supply, such as food, toilets, and bottled water.
In particular, the technology industry has warned about the delay in sending electronic goods.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the application for self-defense has increased 100 times.
This request resulted in an increase of up to twenty - twice the normal price and a postponement of medical supplies for four to six months.
This also causes a lack of self-defense around the world, and WHO warns that this will endanger health.
In Australia, pantheon offers a new opportunity for a daigo buyer to sell Australia’s products in Tiongkok.
This activity has resulted in milk shortages in some supermarkets and has been banned by the Australian government, despite the prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and Wuhan, and the demand for food, the two areas are being avoided from food shortages.
The steps taken by Tionkok and Italy in the fight against illegal cultivation and trade in important products have been successful so that the expected lack of acute food will be avoided in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with its large agricultural production, has not yet undergone a significant order, but the price can be increased according to the industrial court.
Empty food was found only temporarily, even in Wuhan, along with the government's office in Tiongkok, to make sure that pigmeat was sufficient for society.
Similar laws exist in Italy, which obliges food producers to keep reservations for emergency situations like this.
Global economic downturn has been felt in Tiongkok: according to a media report on 16 March, the Tiongkok economy has been hit in the first two months of 2020 as a result of the government's steps towards preventing the spread of the virus, and the sale of 20.5% of coal.
Since Tiongkok land is a major economic center and manufacturing plant, the virus is considered to pose a major threat of destabilization against the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit estimated that the market would keep moving until there was a clearer picture of the potential of the end result.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could exceed the SARS disease in 2002-2004.
An estimate of researchers at the University of Washington, St. Louis said that disease has affected more than $300 billion in the world market chain, which can last up to two years.
The country's oil export organization (OPEC) is reported to be "dried" after the oil prices have been severed as a result of the lack of demand from Tiongkok.
On February 24, the global stock market fell due to increasing the significance of the number of COVID-19 cases outside of the Land Tiongkok.
On February 27th, due to increased concern over coronary disease, various U.S. stock indices, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 Index, and Dow Jones Industrial Average, reported a sharp decline since 2008, with Dow falling 1,191 points, the largest one-day turnout since the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
The three stock indices close the week with more than 10% in order.
On February 28th, Scope Ratings GmbH imposed a rate of credit on the Tiongkok government, but defended Outlook Negative.
Stockpiles again due to the concern of the coronation virus, the largest pollination took place on March 16.
Many people think that an economic recession might happen.
Economics Mohamed El-Erian praised the emergency steps of the central bank and the country in due course.
The central bank reacts faster than they did in the 2008 monetary crisis.
Tourism is one of the worst sectors of travel bans, public housing coverage including tourist destinations, and government restrictions around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights because of low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while the British Flybe regional airline collapsed.
The impact on the shipping industry is at a level that has never been seen before.
Some railway stations and ferries were also closed.
The epidemic was close to Chunyun, the main holiday season related to Imlek’s New Year’s holiday.
A number of events involving many people were canceled by the central and regional governments, including the New Year’s Festival of Annual Imlek, and private companies also set up to close shops and tourist destinations, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many of Imlek’s New Year’s events and visits were closed to prevent mass meetings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and the traditional temple exhibition.
In 24 of 31 provinces, towns, and Tionkok districts, authorities have extended the New Year’s holiday until February 10th and have ordered most jobs not to be reopened until that date.
These areas are home to 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has increased disease control to the highest level and announced emergency situations, closed school to March, and cancelled the New Year's celebration.
Visits to European and Latin America are down by 40%.
North American and Middle East hunters have 50–60%.
This also results in a 33-43% survey and a foot trip to the expense center in March is compared to February.
An operator of the world's spending center is taking additional steps, such as increased sanitation, thermal scanner installation to check the temperature of the buyer, and the cancellation of the event.
In January and February 2020, during the outbreak of Wuhan, some 5 million people in Tiongkok lost their jobs.
In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronary disease can cause a loss of 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate can reach 32%. In India, quarantine causes tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (paid by daily wages) to be interfered. A survey by Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households had some kind of job losses. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since they were quarantined in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany submitted a short-term work scheme to government officials, called Short Work.
The German short - term compensation scheme was adopted by France and England.
Throughout the world, the art and cultural heritage sector is very large in scope, influenced by the organization’s and individual’s operations, both locally and locally.
The arts and cultural sector organizations strive to support their high mission (often publicized) to give cultural heritage access to society, to protect the safety of workers and society, and to support artists if possible.
In March 2020, all over the world and at different levels, museums, libraries, theatres, and other cultural institutions were closed without time, with exhibitions, events, and shows cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts are being made to provide alternative services through the digital platform. The impact of this recent and rapidly developing disease is the abolition of religious services, major sports events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences, and entertainment.
The Vatican announced that the celebration of the Holy Week in Rome, which ended in the last week of the Christian Prapaskah’s reinstatement, was canceled.
Many churches promote Christian age to live at home and not attend Mass on Sunday; some churches provide church services through radio, direct television or television, while others offer drive-in worship or exaltation.
By closing up the church and the chapel by the Roman Catholic Church and emptying it of the site of St. Peter from the Christian ministers, other bodies of religion also canceled services and limited public meetings in churches, churches, synagogues, temples, and synagogues.
And the Qur'an announced the abstention of prayer in the most remote part of the land, and the places of worship were then closed, while the people of Saudi Arabia prohibited them from entering the holy places of Mecca and Madinah.
It has caused the most significant interference with the world’s sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sports events have been cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA 2019-2020 Champions League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, the UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
This disaster disrupts the 2020 Summer Olympics, which was originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympics Committee announced on 24 March that the event will "reschedule until 2020, but will not be more than summer 2021."All over the world, casinos and other gaming venues are closed and direct poker tournaments are postponed or cancelled.
This has led many players to live online, many online gambling sites to report significant increases in recording, and the entertainment industry has been influenced by a variety of music groups that have slowed down or canceled concert tours.
Many big theaters like Broadway also delay all the shows.
Artists explore various ways to continue to produce and share work through the Internet as an alternative to showing traditional live concerts, such as online broadcasts or making a "festival" web-based for artists to display, broadcast, and publish their work.
Many of the Internet’s coronavirus themes are being spread online with many people who turn to humor and turn attention in the middle of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against the natives of Tionghoa and East Asia, as well as against people from the most prominent regions of Europe, the United States, and other countries.
An incident of fear, suspicion, and outright hostility in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
The report of February (when most cases are still limited in Tiongkok) records racial sentiment expressed in various groups around the world that Tionghoa people deserve to receive viruses or what they claim to be a proper reward.
Some countries in Africa have also experienced an increase in anti-Tiongkok sentiment.
Many Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination because of their region’s origin.
There's already been support for the Tionghoea people, both the brain and the neck, and for people in the area that's infected with the virus.
As a result of the disease's development to the new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first European country to suffer from the serious COVID-19, could also be the target of suspicion and xenophobia. The citizens of the countries included Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea initially signed a petition to prevent the Tionghoa people from entering their country in an attempt to stop the disease.
In Japan, the #ChineseDontComeToJapan newspaper is a train on Twitter.
Tionghoa and other Asians in Britain and the United States report an increase in the rates of racial and aggression.
US President Donald Trump was criticized for calling the coronation virus "Tionkok Virus", the term that critics considered racist and anti-Tionkok.
The guests in Ukraine attacked the buses that took Ukrainians and foreigners who were evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from East India, bordering with Tiongkok, and studying in large Indian cities were reported to suffer from related coronary disease.
President of the Bharatiya Party of the United States of America in the West Bank of Dilip Ghosh said that Tiongkok had destroyed nature and "that is why God avenged them."
The statement was then threatened by the Consulate of Tiongkok in Calcutta, by calling it "a gourmet." In Tiongkok, xenophobia and racism against the non-Tionghoa people were exposed to a pandi, with foreigners being described as "foreigners" and targeted for "refuge".
Many of the newspapers that have been used for the treatment of AIDS have deleted it for some or all of their coronation.
Many scientists have thus made open access to disease - related sciences.
Some scientists have chosen to quickly share the results on the job servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for coronary respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of viruses and detect antibodies produced as a response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the sample is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronary RNA.
This test is specific and designed to detect RNA virus SARS-COV-2 only.
This test is used to confirm new infection or to confirm that it is still active.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used to diagnose and monitor the population.
Antibodies show a large number of people who have become distraught, including those whose symptoms are too mild to report, or those who have no symptoms.
The exact mortality rate and level of group violence in the population can be determined from this test.
Because of limited testing, until March 2020, no country has data on the prevalence of virus in its population.
Until March 23rd, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there is a large variation in the number of tests that countries have done.
These variations may also have a significant impact on the number of fatalities reported, which are likely to be too high in some countries.
Using real-time transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), this test can be performed on a breath sample obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal or spout samples.
In general, the results are available in a few hours or two.
The RT-PCR test performed on the pancreas can only be relied on in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus could disappear in the throat as long as it continues to replicate in the lungs.
As an alternative, for the most infected people tested in the second week, the sample material can be taken from the inside airway using the jasper catheter or the material produced by the fungus (sputum).
One of the initial PCR tests developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 used the real-time transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and formed at least 250,000 testing tools to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed SARS-CoV-2 detection devices based on PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus) licensed on 28 January 2020.
In Tiongkok, the BGI Group is one of the first companies to accept the emergency use of the Tionkok National Medical Products Administration for PCR SARS-CoV-2 detection devices. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has distributed the diagnostic panel RT-PCR Real-Time Coronavirus New 2019 (2019-nCV) to the public health laboratory through International reagent resource.
One of the three genetic tests in the old version testing devices provides unconvincing results due to reaction errors, and the number of tests on the CDC in Atlanta is limited; this results in an average of less than 100 samples per day during February 2020.
Tests using two components are considered not to be reliable until 28 February 2020, and only after that the country laboratory and the local laboratory are allowed to carry out the tests.
This test was approved by the United States Medical and Food Agency on the basis of the Emergency Use Authorisation. The US Commercial Laboratory began testing early in March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced COVID-19 testing availability based on RT-PCR on a national scale.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made a COVID-19 test available nationally on 9 March 2020.
No quantity limits are announced; collection and processing of specis should be done according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 tests have been developed and produced by the VECTOR Country Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Monitoring Service for Health Care. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported developing tests to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for tests that can be performed within 3.5 hours with high volume so that one machine can perform approximately 4.128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued Emergency Use Authorisation (EU) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on the system m2000 Abbott; the FDA previously issued the same authorisation to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received the US from the FDA for a test that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved tests using non-PCR isothermal nuclear amplifying technology.
Since there is no need for a series of temperature replacement cycles, this method can only produce positive results within five minutes and negative results within 13 minutes.
Now there are about 18,000 machines in the US and Abbott predicting to increase production until it produces 50,000 tests per day.
A library survey published in March 2020 concluded that "torax photos have a small diagnostic value at an early stage, as soon as CT [computed tomography] finds are already before symptoms."
Special features on CT include ground-glass opacity of a bilateral multilobe with peripheral, asymmetry distribution, and posterior.
Subpleurous domination, crazy paving, and consolidation are all about disease development.
In Wuhan, a study comparing PCR to CT at the source of the current pandemic showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with a lot of puncture filtration features with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "CT must not be used for screening or as the first line test in the COVID-19 diagnosis."In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is the formation of antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect infections in individuals from about 7 days after symptoms, to determine immunity to the disease, and in population monitoring. Checks can be done at the central laboratory (CLT) or with point-of-care (PoCT) tests.
The automatic system with high results in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform this test, but its availability will depend on the level of production for each system.
For CLT, it is common to use a peripheral blood specis, although a range of specis can be used to follow immune responses.
For PoCT, it is common to use a peripheral blood speciment that is obtained through skin clotting.
Unlike the PCR method, extraction steps are not required before verification. On March 26, 2020, the FDA mentioned 29 agencies that provided reporting to the agency as required and that is why it is now able to distribute their antibody tests.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their testing devices that could detect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.
Its test capacity up to a few hundred samples in a few hours, so much faster than conventional PCR testing for RNA virus.
Antibodies were usually detected 14 days after infection, and early April, Raya discovered that not one of the antibodies he bought was good enough to be used.
Hong Kong adjusts the schedule for patients to be able to live at home, "the emergency department will give the patient a specific tube," they poured into it, sent it back, and obtained the test results a few moments later. NHS England announces that NHS is pioneering the expected case testing scheme at home to eliminate the risk of patients entering the hospital or having to disinfect the ambulance if used. In an elevated test for the suspected case of COVID-19, a professional health force will take samples using appropriate prevention measures.
On 2 March, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicals of Germany said that Germany had the capacity of about 12,000 tests per day in road treatment and 10,700 tests had been carried out in the previous week.
The cost is borne by health insurance if the test is requested by the doctor.
According to President Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, the trials were offered in several large cities.
On March 26, 2020, the number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, in total, at least 483.295 samples have been tested until and including weeks 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-COV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, by combining samples and testing further if a positive compound sample was found. In Wuhan, the laboratory detects an emergency of 2,000 metres of the area called "Huo-Yan" (Mondarin: ˈ, or "Api Mata" in Indonesian) opened on February 5, 2020 by BGI, which can process more than 10,000 samples daily.
With its construction being monitored by Wang Jian's BGI base and taking 5 days, the model shows that the case in Hubei can be 47% higher and the cost associated with quarantine management can be doubled twice if this test capacity is not available.
Wuhan laboratory was immediately followed by the Hua-Yan laboratory in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities throughout Tiongkok.
On 4 March 2020, its total daily capacity is 50,000 tests per day. The open-source multiplex design produced by Origami Assays can test as many patients as 1.222 samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. This design can be carried out in a small laboratory without needing a robotic fluid control.
Until March, insufficient response and lack of response have been a necessity for mass testing in the European Union, Britain, and the United States.
Because of this, a number of researchers have been trying to explore the sampling protocol involving sampling at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. On March 31, the United Arab Emirates was reported to conduct more coronary testing per capita than in any country, and prepared to increase the test scale to reach the majority of the population.
This is achieved by a combination of ramp tests and the purchase of a mass-based laboratory of the population of Group 42 and BGI (based on the emergency detection laboratory "Huo-Yan" in Tiongkok).
Built in 14 days, this lab is capable of carrying out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory to have this scale outside of Tiongkok.
Various test recipes that target various parts of the genetic profile of coronavirus are developed in Tiongkok, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopts German prescriptions for the production of test devices sent to countries with low production capacity without a source of self-development.
German prescriptions were published on January 17, 2020; protocols developed by the United States Disease Control Centre were not available until January 28 to delay the testing available in the United States. At the beginning of the plague, Tiongkok and the United States had problems with testing tools; these two countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient testing tools to meet the demands and recommendations of health experts.
On the contrary, experts say that widespread testing in South Korea has helped to reduce the preaching of the new coronation virus.
The testing capacity, most of it in the private sector laboratories, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization launched an increase in the testing program as the best way to slow down the growth of the COVID-19 pandemic. A high demand for testing because the spread of the virus caused hundreds of thousands of tests to wait for operation in the U.S. private laboratory, and the preparation of weapons and chemical reactions became important.
In March 2020, Tiongkok reported accuracy problems on their testing devices.
In the United States, CDC's developed test tools have "defects"; the government then removes the barrier of bureaucracy that prevents testing by private individuals.
The company explains that false results may be due to failure in collecting samples or using the test tools correctly.
Kementrian Spanish said that they would attract the wrong product, and replace it with another test tool provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test tools purchased by the Czech Republic from Tiongkok produced the wrong product.
Minister Matovič suggested that this test device be disposed of to the Danube River. Ateş Kara of Turkey's Kementrian Health says Turkey's test tool from Tiongkok has "high error level" and they don't "use it". British Raya bought 3.5 million test tools from Tiongkok, but in early April 2020, they announced that this test tool could not be used.
The tests, followed by the quarantine of those who tested positive and tracked those who contacted the positive SARS-COV-2, produce positive results.
Researchers working in the city of Vó Italia, the first location of death due to COVID-19 in Italy, carried out two rounds of tests across the entire population of 3,400 people, with a distance of about 10 days.
About half of those tested positive have no symptoms, and all cases found are quarantined.
With travel restrictions to this community, the new infection is not available at all.
By tracking aggressive contacts, travel restrictions on entry, testing, and quarantine, the crown virus pandemic in Singapore has developed much slower than other developing countries, even without extreme restrictions, such as the closure of restaurants and railway companies.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore suggested that people stay at home on March 28, but schools were reopened shortly after the holiday on March 23.
Other countries also deal with pandemics by tracking aggressive contacts, travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, but with quarantine areas that are not too aggressive, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A study of statistics found that countries that tested more, relative to the number of deaths, had a much lower number of fatalities, perhaps because these countries were more able to detect people with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no testing capacity, and the national laboratory with limited COVID-19 experience, send five positive COVID-19 samples and ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 exist in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following section, the "positive test result" column was influenced by the country's test policy.
A country that only examines those who are treated in the hospital will have a positive result higher than a country that tests all its inhabitants, whether they show symptoms or not, with the same other factors.
Washing hands, also called hand cleaning, is the act of cleaning someone's hands to remove dirt, oil, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Wash hands with soap consistently at certain "critical times" all day preventing many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which have been flown through the faecal-oral route.
People may also experience respiratory disease, such as influenza or seismic conditions, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (that is, the membrane of the mucous membrane).
Five critical times all day critical to washing hands with soap are: before and after pouring out big water, after cleaning the child's ass or replacing the poppies, before swallowing the child, before eating and before and after preparing food or cooking meat, fish, or honey.
If there is no water or soap, hands can be cleaned with dust. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, when, and after preparing food.
Before and after the treatment.
After changing pops or cleaning up a kid who just used a toilet.
After brushing his nose, his nose, his nose, or his brain.
After touching animals, animal food, or animal shit.
Medical hand cleaners complain about cleaning practices related to medical procedures.
Wash your hands before giving medical treatment or medicine to prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of washing hands is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacterials, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause danger or disease.
This is especially important for those who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also important for the public.
Wash hands with plenty of health benefits, including minimising the preaching of influenza, coronation virus, and other infectious diseases; preventing the causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the number of infant mortality in pregnant women at home.
A study conducted in 2013 showed that the increase in the number of children who wash their hands can gradually increase their height.
In developing countries, infant mortality from respiratory disease and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate from the disease to almost 50%.
Interventions that encourage hand washing can reduce diarrhea to about the same extent; this intervention can be done by providing clean water in a low - yield area.
48% of diarrhea cases can be linked to soap washers. Washing hands with soap is the only most effective and cheap way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infection (ISPA), as a low awareness behavior done at home, in school, and in society all over the world.
Pneumonia, the main ISPA, is the cause of the death of one girl’s child; it causes the death of about 1.8 million children each year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia cause death to nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, washing hands with soap before eating and after using toilets as a habit can save more lives in exchange for vaccines or any medical action, and reducing death from diarrhea to almost half and death from acute respiratory infection to a quarter.
Wash hands usually combined with other sanitation actions as part of the water, sanitation, and cleaning program (WASH).
Wash your hands and protect yourself from impetigo caused by direct physical contact.
Small side effects of washing hands are often done by washing hands that can cause skin damage as a result of skin loss.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can lead to bitter and chilly skin conditions, known as hand exodus or hand dermatitis, especially among health officials.
Washing hands too often is also seen as one of the obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCDs).
There are five critical times all day long when washing your hands with soap is important for reducing the flow of the disease by oral means: before and after using the toilet (small water, large water), after cleaning the child's ass (in exchange), before swallowing the child, before eating and before/after preparing meat, fish, or soda.
Another important time to apply the technique of washing the right hands to prevent the spread of the disease is before and after the treatment of the wound; after the scarring, the swelling, or the swelling of the nose; after touching the dirt or handling the animal; and after touching the trash.
In many countries, the level of washing hands with soap is still low.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of households practiced hand washing with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia has the highest level of 97 percent; the United States is nearly 77 percent; and Tiongkok at the lowest level of 23 percent. Now some methodologies are available to improve behavioural changes to adopt behavioral washing hands with soap at critical times. Washing hands for students at a specified time is one of the choices in developing countries to wash hands in child behavior.
The basic health care program of the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of how to support child health and education.
The giving of worm medicine twice a year, added by washing hands every day with soap and toothache every day with fluoride, is the core of this national program.
The program was also successful in Indonesia.
The cleaning of the micro-organism from the skin is reinforced by addition of soap or water contamination.
The main task of soap and detergent is to reduce obstacles to the flow and to increase the flow of power.
Only water is an inefficient skin cleanser because of the fat and protein, which are organic pollutants, is not easily flowing into the water.
In addition, fat and protein cleaning has been assisted by adequate flow of water.
Dark soap, because of its reusable properties, may contain bacteria that have been used in the past.
A small number of studies that examined the transfer of bacteria from densely contaminated soap concluded that the transfer could not occur because the bacteria were able to be bloated.
Even so, the CDC continues to say "the liquid soap which is extracted from the vessel without touching the hands more popular."
Antibacterial soap is widely encouraged to a people who are conscious of their health.
So far, there is no evidence that the use of antiseptics or recommended infections is better for a persistent antibiotic organism in the wild.
However, the antibacterial soap contains a common antibacterial agent, such as triclosan, which has a list of persistent strains of the organism.
So even though the resistant strains are not targeted by the antibacterial soap, they may not be effective based.
In addition to surfactants and skin protection agents, higher formulations can contain nitrogen (ascetic acid, ascorbate, lactose) as pH adjusters, benzoate as active antimicrobials, and further skin conditioners (languages, vitamins, mentols, and plant extracts).A comprehensive analysis from the Oregon University’s Faculty of Public Health shows that soap is as effective as an antibacterial soap that contains triclosing in the prevention of disease and cleaning bacteria from the hands.
Hot water to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 °C).
Hot soap water is more effective than cold soap water in eliminating natural oil that retains pollution and bacteria.
However, with the confidence of many, scientific studies show that hot water use has no effect in reducing the number of microbes in the hands.
Handicraft or antiseptics are non-water-based cleaning agents.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand cleaning agents were non-water-based alcoholics (also known as alcohol-based hand cleaners, antiseptic hand cleaners, or hand salinization).
Most of this cleaning agent is based on the isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated together with the ventilating material such as Carbomer (acrylate polymer) to become gel or with moisture such as glycerin to become liquid or fuzzy to be easily used and to reduce the reducing effect of alcohol.
The addition of peroxide hydrogen enhances the activity of antimicrobials further. Hand-inspired with at least 60-95% alcohol is an effective bait killer.
Alcohol donation kills bacteria, bacteria resistant to many drugs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza, and hepatitis), and insects.
Alcohol sanitation containing 70% alcohol killed 99.97% (log 3.5 as with 35 decibels) bacteria in 30 seconds after clothing and 99.99% to 99.999% (log 4 to 5) bacteria in 1 minute after clothing.
Alcohol-based handicrafting is almost totally ineffective against the norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of mulling gastroenteritis. Antiseptic hands or alcohol wipers in a limited number should be used to wash or cover two hands completely.
The front and the back two hands and in the soles and the end of each finger are thrown about 30 seconds to the liquid, foam, or dry gel.
The end of the finger should also be washed thoroughly by rubbing it on two hands. The Center for Control and Prevention of U.S. Diseases more recommends hand washing instead of hand washing, especially when the hands are dirty.
Increased use of the nursing agent due to ease of use and rapid killing activity against the micro-organism; however, the nursing agent should not be used as a replacement for the right hand washing, unless soap and water are not available.
The use of alcohol-based handicrafts can often cause dry skin, unless the emotional and/or skin receptors are added to the formula.
The effect of dehydration from alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emotional to the formula.
In clinical trials, hand surgery based on alcohol - containing emotions causes irritation and skin dryness far lower than soap and antimicrobial detachment.
Dermatitis allergic contact, urticaria syndrome, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additive in the hands of alcohol rarely occurs.
A lower trend has resulted in contact dermatitis that interferes with the attractiveness of this product than washing hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-air agents don't clean their hands from organic matter, but only disinfection.
For this reason, soap and water are ineffective in preventing many pathogens because the pathogen is still in the hands.
Alcohol freehand surveying is highly dependent on its content and formulation, and according to history, this product is significantly worse than alcohol and alcohol abuse.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have continuous antimicrobial activity and to accumulate after clothing, not like alcohol, which has been shown to decrease after repeated use, perhaps due to progressive side effects.
Many people in the low - production community were unable to buy soap and use it as a substitute for wheat or land.
Blue or soil may be more effective than water, but less effective than soap.
One of the worries is, if it's contaminated with microorganisms, soil or ashes, it might increase the preaching of the disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, wheat is also a disinfectant agent because, if it's in contact with water, it'll form an alkaline stream.
WHO recommends wheat and sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
Techniques wash right hands based on the recommendation of the U.S. Disease Control Centre to prevent disease progression include the following steps:
Wash your hands with hot or cold water.
Water flows from the recommended storage facilities may be contaminated, while the water’s temperature seems to have no effect.
Put your hand out with a lot of soap, including your back, on your fingers, and under your forearms.
Sabun lifts the tea out of the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using only water.
At least for 20 seconds.
Squeezing creates scars, which help to remove the scar from the skin, and squeezing longer removes more scars.
If it's exactly under the water flow.
To count in the basketball can make your hands contaminated back.
Dry it with a dry cloth or let it dry in the air.
Wet hands and thighs are easier to return to, and often passed by are jams, wrists, joints between fingers, and under my forearms.
The built-in and the covered paint can store the micro-organism.
The lotion is often recommended to keep your hands out of drying; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection.
A variety of low-cost options can be made to facilitate the washing of hands when water is not available and/or soap is not available, e.g. by immersing water from a jar or bottle that is suspended and opened and/or using wheat, if necessary, in the developing country. In situations where the water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries) is limited, there is a water supply, such as "tippy-taps", and other low-cost options.
The tippy tube is a simple technology that uses wired water bottles, rope operated by the foot to place a little water in the hand, and a drop of soap.
Effective hand-washing is an important part of the hand-cleaning process, but there is a debate about the form of most effective hand-washing in the general toilet.
The more research shows that paper sheets are much cleaner than the electric handkerchiefs found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and by the European Tissue Symposium paper industry was conducted to compare the levels of paper paper sheet cleaning, hot air washing, and more modern jet handling.
After washing and washing hands with warm air coolers, the total number of bacteria found increased by 194% in the fingerbooks and 254% in the palm of the hand.
Irritating with jet air coolers causes an average total of 42% of the total number of bacteria in the fingers and 15% in the palm of the hand.
After washing and washing hands with paper sheets, the total number of bacteria decreases by 76% in the fingers and 77% in the palm of the hands.Also, scientists are testing to determine the potential for passing contamination on other toilet users and the toilet environment as a result of each type of drying method.
Jet air handlers, which pass through the air from the unit at a rate of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), can blow microorganisms from the hands and units and potentially contaminate other toilet users and the toilet environment up to 2 meters.
The use of a warm air cooler spreads the microorganism up to 0.25 meters from the cooler.
In 2005, in a study carried out by TÜV Product and Umwelt, various methods of hand abatement were evaluated.
After hand cooling, changes in the number of bacteria are observed:
There are many hand washing machines, and the hand washing has been compared to a washing machine.
Washing hands using hand care tissue is an alternative during walking if there is no soap and water.
Alcohol-based handicrafts must contain at least 60% of alcohol.
Medical personnel were required to wash their hands long after the doctors of Hungaria Ignaz Semmelweis found its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that the rate of infection fell with the use of the device.
Medical hand washing is done for a minimum of 15 seconds, using soap and water in lots or gels to soften and crush each part of the hand.
Hands should be rubbed together with fingers tied together.
If there's shit under my forelegs, the hair patch can be used to erase it.
Because of its ability to hold on to the water in the hand, hands need to be thoroughly weighed down and dried with a clean sheet.
After drying, the paper sheet was used to turn off the water supply (and open the door if necessary).
This action avoids hand recontamination from the surface.
The purpose of washing hands in health care settings is to remove the pathogen microorganism ("human") and avoid the leakage.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of washing hands still at an unacceptable level in most medical settings, with a large number of doctors and nurses still forget to wash hands before touching patients until they release the microorganism.
One study shows that washing the right hands and other simple procedures can reduce the level of blood flow infection related to the catheter to 66 percent.
The concept of WHO hand cleaning is also available on its website for public comment.
The relevant review by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand cleaning if compliance with the rules is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five Hours" to wash hands:
after spreading to the blood/flow of the body
before aseptic duties, and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (such as "medicine" or "antimicrobial") functions to kill the detergent.
The killing function may be desired before doing the medicine or in a situation when the antibiotic is very vulnerable. To "screw" hands before the surgery, it is necessary to fire and kill them without touching, wash chlorhexidine or iodium, sterile laptop to wash hands after washing, and sterile tissue to wash and other sterile instruments to clean under my feet.
All the jewelry has to be released.
This procedure indicates washing your hands and hands down to your fingertips, usually 2-6 minutes.
There is no need for a long time to go by (10 minutes).
When it comes to watering, the water in the lower arms must be stopped so that it does not flow back into the hand.
After the washing of hands, the hands were washed with sterile cloth, and the blades were sewn.
To reduce the amount of work involved, it is better to wash your hands or to use a handshake before and after handling a patient.
To control the infection of staphylococcus in the hospital, it was found that the greatest benefit of cleaning hands is from the first 20% washing, and that the extra benefits obtained very little when the hand cleaning frequency is increased to over 35%.
Washing with soap usually causes more than three times the spread of infection to food than washing with antibacterial soap. The comparison between shaking hands with alcohol-based flow and washing hands with antibacterial soap with median time every 30 seconds shows that alcohol-based hand cleaners reduce the contamination of bacteria 26% more than antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than handwashers based on alcohol to reduce influenza A H1N1 and difficult clostridium spores. Intervention to increase hand cleaning in health care settings can include education for staff on hand washing, increased availability of handwashers based on alcohol, and written reminders and stickers to staff.
More research is needed to find out the most effective interventions in various health care settings.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is recognized as a cost-effective way to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, at least a reliable supply of water, soap, or hand - washing facilities in the homes, schools, and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve universal hand - washing.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, handwashing near a private toilet or a public toilet is rare, although options are available to make cheap washrooms.
In any case, the lower level of hand washing can also occur because of the habit that has been planted and not because of the lack of soap or water.
The urge to wash hands with soap can influence political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of washing hands, and bring about changes in the behavior of the long - term population.
Effective walking requires monitoring and evaluation.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that effective community-based approaches in increasing hand washing in LMIC, while the social networking campaign was less effective. One example of this is the "Third Star Approach" by UNICEF, which motivates schools to take simple and cheap steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other cleaning conditions.
When the minimum standard is reached, the school can move from one star to three.
Building a washroom can be part of a hand washing campaign that reduces the disease and death of children.
The World Hand Washing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that tries to achieve the goal of changing behavior. As a result of the pandemic of the Crown Virus 2019-2020, UNICEF encourages the washing of hands.
Some studies examine cost-effective washing hands in countries developing in relation to disability-adjusted Life Year (DALY) prevention or the loss of years due to illness.
One survey shows that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more expensive than water intervention and other sanitation.
It is important to wash hands for human health, especially for people in a state of rest, such as a newborn mother or a wounded army in a hospital, first known in the middle of the 19th century by two hand cleaning workers: Dr. Hungaria Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, "modern care" in England.
At that time, many still believe that infection is caused by the bad smell of mist or bad air.
In the 1980s, the disease that was cured by food and infection associated with health care made the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention more active as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The plague of swine fever in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 will increase awareness in many countries it will be important to wash your hands with soap to protect yourself from that contagious disease.
For example, the poster "the right hand washing technique" was hung next to the washbasin in the public toilet and in the office and airport buildings in Germany.
The expression "washing hands" means saying that someone's willingness to be responsible for something or to be involved in something.
That expression comes from a Bible passage in the book of Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands on the decision to represent Jesus Christ, but it has become widely used in the English community.
In Shakespeare’s work, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began washing her hands continually to clean up the imaginary node; actions that revealed her guilt for the crime she had committed and for having persuaded her husband to do so.
Also, it has been known that, after remembering or meditating on nonethical acts, people tend to wash their hands more often and to value their hands more.
Further, those who are allowed to wash their hands after meditation have a less likely involvement in the "cleaning" compensation action, such as volunteering.
Religion commands hand washing for the purpose of cleansing and symbolism; symbolic hand washing, which uses water, but without soap to wash hands, is a ritual part of washing hands in many religions, including Bahá'í, Hindu faith, fasting and fasting in Jews, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam; it also commands hand washing for cleansing, especially after certain acts.
Hindus, Jews, and Muslims were obliged to wash their hands after using toilets.
In addition, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews, and Muslims were required to wash their hands before and after meals.
Hazard management of the workplace for COVID-19
Hazard management of the workplace for COVID-19 is a safety methodology and occupational health monitoring for the prevention of coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The proper risk management at the workplace depends on the workplace and job, based on the assessment of the risk of shelter sources, the level of morbidity in society, and the risk factor for each worker who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk work has minimal contact with the public and other work partners; for this work, steps are being taken to prevent basic infections, which include washing hands, motivate workers to stay at home if they are sick, breathing, and perform routine cleaning and work environment infections.
Work at risk is covering work that requires close or frequent contact with people who are unknown or expected to suffer from COVID-19, but may be infected due to a decline in a society that is taking place or an international journey.
This group includes workers who have contacts with the general public, such as at school, the working environment with a high population density, and high-volume wheel settings.
Hazard control for this group, besides basic infection prevention steps, includes ventilation using high efficiency airflows, protection against insects, and provision of self-protection devices when faced with COVID-19 suffering.
OSHA considers the health and morgue of a person who is known or expected to suffer from COVID-19 at high risk, which increases the risk of being very high if workers perform aerosol-based procedures on, or take or deal with a speci from, a person known or expected to suffer from COVID-19.
The appropriate hazardous controls for this worker include technical controls, such as negative pressure ventilation spaces, and self - protective devices suitable for the job.
COVID-19 disease can have some effects on the workplace.
The worker may not come to work because of illness, need to care for others, or fear of the possibility of paralysis.
The pattern of trade may change, whether in the form of goods requested, or in the manner in which they are obtained.
Finally, shipments of goods from a very visible geographical area of COVID-19 can be disrupted.
The article considered the level of risk associated with various jobs and jobs, including the source of pay, the risk factors arising from home and community settings, and the risk factors for each worker, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
The article also outlines the controls needed to cope with the risks and emergency articles for situations that may arise as a result of the illness.
Pregnantness and planing may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The purpose of the disease management involves reducing the flow between staff, protecting those at higher risk for poor health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimising the adverse effects on other entities in the marketing chain.
The level of disease in the business community is influenced by the abuse taken.
Hazard management is a labor force that is widely used in safety and health at work to group hazardous management based on its effectiveness.
When the risk of COVID-19 cannot be resolved, the most effective control is technical control, followed by administrative investigation, and the last self-defense device.
Technical control includes isolating workers from employment risks without relying on employee behaviour and can be the most costly solution to be applied.
Administrative management is a change in the policies or procedures required by the employer or by the employer.
Self - protection tools (APDs) are considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but they can help prevent parts of the land.
All types of APD should be selected on the basis of the risks to workers, properly installed (e.g., respirators), consistently and properly handled, tested, treated, and replaced on a regular basis, if necessary, and released, cleaned, and stored correctly or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have minimal work contacts with the public and other work partners.
Steps in the prevention of the recommended basic infection for all workplaces, including frequent hand washing, prompting workers to stay at home if the illness, breathing ethics covers covering the thighs and thighs, providing networks and garbage, preparing work from a distance or working shift with time of arrival/relapse, if necessary, telling workers not to use the tools and equipment of others, and doing routine cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Rapid identification and isolation of potential displaced persons are important steps in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at work.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers with acute respiratory symptoms should stay at home until they are free of fever, signs of fever, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using a fever cure or other symptoms changer, and that flexible vacation policies allow workers to stay at home to care for sick family members, and that workers learn about this policy.
According to the OSHA, refugee risk work is covering work that requires close or frequent contact at six feet (1.8 m) with people unknown or suspected of having COVID-19, but may be infected with SARS-COV-2 because of an influx in society around the business location, or because someone has recently made an international trip to the location with a wide COVID-19 influx.
This group includes employees who have contacts with the general public such as in school, the working environment with high-volume satellites, and high-volume satellites. Technical control for this group and high-risk groups include installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing the level of ventilation, installing physical obstructions such as nursing plastics, and installing drives-thru or lifts for customer services. Administrative control for this group and high-risk groups motivate sick workers to live at home, changing face-to-face with virtual communication, making time-lapse rotations, stopping my non-essential travel to a location that is experiencing COVID wave-19, developing a high-risk communication plan and requiring emergency management of the client, and ordering the investigation of investigation and investigation.
Workers in this risk group rarely need breathing.
If a person falls ill on a plane, proper controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick from others at 6 feet, showing a cabin crew to take care of the sick, and offering a face mask to the sick person or asking him to close his mouth and nose with a cloth when he is sneezing or sneezing.
You've got to wear a medical gloves all the time when you take care of sick passengers or touch a liquid or a potentially contaminated surface and maybe another protective device if a sick passenger has a fever, a continuous swelling, or a difficulty breathing.
For commercial voyages, including passenger ships and other passenger ships, the risk management should include delaying travel if the disease is ill, isolating itself, and informing the medical center on the ship immediately if someone has a fever or other symptoms while on board the ship.
Ideally, medical attention should be given to the cabin of people who have been isolated, leaving the public ministry for school and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closure to clean or disinfect if the infected person has ever been in a school building.
If there is a decline in society at the minimum level until now, the social exclusion strategy can be applied, which includes: canceling field visits, meetings, and other major groups, such as physical education, the voice class, or eating at the cafeteria, increasing the distance between the table, the time of arrival and a gradual return, limiting non-essential visitors, and using a separate health office location for children with flulike symptoms.
If there is a high trend in local society, alongside the social exclusion strategy, the school closure can be considered. For law enforcement officials who do day-to-day activities, health risks are considered to be low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who have to contact confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidance as emergency medical techniques, including the use of appropriate self-protection devices.
If close contact occurs during arrest, workers must clean and disinfect the sand and task equipment before re-use by using proton or household cleaning sheet and follow the standard operation procedure to control and dispose of previous APDs and to control and wash dirty clothes.
OSHA considers the health and safety of certain bodies to be at high or very high risk.
High-risk work includes health care, support, laboratory, and medical transportation powers that are shared with patients known or expected to be COVID-19.
This work is very high risk of exposure if workers perform aerosol performance procedures on, or take or handle the specis of, a patient known or expected to be COVID-19.
Aerosol production procedures include intubation, induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and dental examinations, or the collection of invasive specimens.
The work of the morgue chamber is at risk of high paralysis involving the worker involved in preparing the body of a person known or expected in the case of COVID-19 at the time of death; this work is at very high risk of paralysis if the worker performs an operation. Additional technical control for this risk group covers the isolation space for a patient known or expected to be COVID-19, including when the aerosol performance procedure is performed.
Special negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health care settings and in the morgue.
Specimen must be handled by the prevention of Level 3 biological safety.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who come to be separated into a different waiting room based on what they are expected to do with COVID-19. In addition to APD, OSHA recommends respirators for those who work 6 feet away from patients who are known or expected to be infected with SARS-COV-2, and those who perform aerosol procedures.
In the United States, N95 filter face-respirators approved by NIOSH or better should be used in the context of a written and comprehensible breathing protection program that includes fitness tests, training, and medical examinations.
Another type of respiratory system can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend covered clothing or coverall because COVID-19 is respiratory disease and is not eliminated by body fluid.
WHO is only recommending a surgical mask for a screening officer at the point of entry.
For those who take breathing, care, or transport COVID-19 patients without aerosol procedures, WHO recommends surgical masks, protective glasses, or facial scars, clothes, and gloves.
If the aerosol procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by a N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Bearing in mind that the APD market is not enough around the world, WHO recommends minimizing the need for APD through remote medical services, physical barriers such as eyelash windows, with only people involved in direct care can enter the room containing COVID-19 patients, using only the APD needed for a particular task, using the same respiratory system without leaving it when treating many patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the APD market chain, and not causing the use of masks for unsymbolized people.

[Covid-19] Lighten burden and prepare for the future
EXPIRY DATE: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
Licence: CC0: No rights protected
We have seen that we are in a unique situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes it clear that we have a global human relationship and responsibility for each other.
We have not yet experienced the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, work, and the construction of the global community, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendships and concerns that we have witnessed among all our workmates by e - mails, calls, and conversations are extraordinary validations that there are extraordinary people, whom we are lucky enough, to work with them.
I am grateful and proud that I can sometimes call you a workmate.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me of how important it is for the world today to be able to access Wikipedia and how strong this is for this important resource to remain available online to everyone.
Your work enables this to happen, regardless of whether you make sure this site keeps running, helping to pay our partners, or helping to maintain the security of our community.
The world needs information from Wikipedia, especially at this time.
This is the moment when not only the work we do but the way we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important adjustments to how we work together, which will start next week.
Adjustments to our work schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, teams met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for a few days and months to come.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought was the right answer to the challenge we were facing and the best way to maintain the organization’s integrity during this time.
We want to eliminate the pressure and support our mission for a long time.
If you need to reduce your schedule, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors, and contractors:
Our daily work hope is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We don't set a holiday, if you can work more on normal hours, this mission needs you.
However, the world can't be predicted right now, and somehow you need to take care of loved ones, shop for tree needs, or go to a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We don't monitor your working hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
This should not be said, but we did say it.
A sick leave or a PTO is not necessary, enough to inform your manager and your team to review your calendars and schedules to ensure that the main areas of work can be completed.
(If you are positively diagnosed with COVID-19, please inform Bryan in the T&C Ops so that T&C can help with support and ensure your situation gets accurate attention from management).
Fellows whose wages are based on hours will be paid in full.
We have said it, and once again, to respect our commitment to an hour-based contractor and staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal working hours.
This includes if you're sick and can't work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use their jobs as a means of coping with the pressures of the world around us.
The work we do can be very satisfying, especially in times like this.
Once again, the main thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what to anticipate and can take appropriate action.
Some work is considered essential.
There's a few jobs to keep going.
SRE, SDM Operations, Trust & Security, and Dana Deployment teams, among other things, are doing important work that may require additional support.
We're going to start the process with all departments to assess the purpose of this moment and divert our focus to support the essentials of our mission.
There's a lot to do for us all, we're just going to focus on the most essential project.
Delaying this time will be nothing for the future.
We're not planning on "bovine labor for abandonment" after this pandemic has passed.
You won't be expected to work a cow to fill an unrealistic time gap right now.
We realize that the situation has changed and will try to set a new target and timeline if necessary.
What about the APP?
To adapt to new realities and to expect the working hours of the day, we mean to adjust the timeline for the implementation of the Year's Agenda 2020-2021.
Our idea is to propose an extension of the 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to calculate so that employees can prioritise important work, self-care, and the care of loved ones while reconciling their needs or wanting to work on a schedule less for a few weeks in the future.
The length of this time line greatly reduces the workload and the current planning pressure throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the next week's board and update delegations and teams to the next step as soon as we get confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for your leadership in this.
Status, administration, and office cleaning
Last week, we were told that one of our SF-based partners might have contracted the COVID-19 virus.
However, with great concern, we employed the antivirus treatment crew to disinfect all the surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They use antivirus fluids from the hospital to disinfect every surface, lobby, and every elevator that accesses our floor.
The building implements its own safety protocol by using products that support the safety of its tenants.
We are happy that the office will be ready to be used when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has shared the COVID-19 protocol with us and all staff members based in DC.
Since last week, our DC office has moved to a far - reaching work schedule, in line with the direction shared with San Francisco.
As some of our NYC-based associates know, we're also discussing renting locations in Brooklyn.
The discussion is ongoing, but it may be delayed.
Some of our friends work far away for the first time.
Our long-term workmates realize that it may need to be adjusted and they want to give you advice:
The duration limit is at least one or two hours.
If a longer session is needed, consider how to divide it into several days.
Define clearly, make a schedule, and send out previous publications.
Make video the default, with tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and direct connections.
Guided by the leadership to facilitate every close relationship, someone to monitor the conversation for questions and to record the conversation list, and someone to help make a close note (or make a collaborative note).
Send email to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your peace compensation to buy small food.
Join #remotes in Slack to talk to your friends about shared work
The SDM Operation Team is looking for web-based ergonomics guidance to support the expansion of the distributed work throughout Yayasan.
The last week we asked all the beneficiaries to take the community to cancel a public event on Wikimedia, such as Edit-a-thon, until WHO said the pandemic is over.
We let them know that we understand our request for cancellation and other limitations can make it impossible for them to complete the conduct that has been approved and that no one will be given insight because of having to postpone or modify the target.
This week we're going to follow further guidance on Wikimania and the conference of the regional community and other topics.
In general, the feelings of the entire global community seem to be a source of sadness over these disturbances, but at the same time provide relief to the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, both Wikimedia and others.
Next, CRT is trying to prepare a site at Meta-Wiki to provide a community space to monitor the impact and follow our communication with them.
Stay connected during the COVID-19 situation
We'll send an invitation to your calendar for Thursday's coming, 2:00 UTC/07:00 p.m. for special staff.
We'll use this time to split up the additional change, answer your questions, and take the time to connect.
We're the same in this situation and we want to help as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to obtain information from this email and all the essential information related to COVID-19 in the Office Wiki.
CRT will continue to update this page and make sure all the information is in one place.
We also try to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, work schedules, or problems with overlaps, or other matters that may need help, do not hesitate to tell and work with the CRT.
We are here to help provide support and to be connected to the needs of others.
If you have a secret or sensitive problem, please send an email to Bryan Judah, Global Operation Director of the International SDM.
Do not let any of this make you feel that you are neglecting your job and responsibilities.
On the contrary, the change is a confession that, at present, our jobs and responsibilities may need to be adjusted in ways we have never done before.
These changes are steps that we believe are important to support each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the necessary support for our movement, and provide the world of services that they provide.
The work we planned before will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, this is the time to support and create space for important work that will come in a few weeks and perhaps a few months ahead.
We need you all to realize it, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can work best when needed.
Finally, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S) and other team leaders (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
B'Enzyme angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that is placed on the outside of the cell (cell membrane) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 has activity that is opposite to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing Angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also functions as a point of entry into the cell for some coronary viruses.
ACE2 human versions are often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 reverse enzyme is a meta-enzyme that contains alloys located on the surface of the endothelial cell and other cells.
ACE2 protein has a terminal-N-m2 Peptide domain and a domain transporter assimilated to a renal amino collectrin terminal-C.
ACE2 is a single type I membrane protein, with an active enzyme domain on the surface of the cell on the lungs and other networks.
The extrasol domain ACE2 is separated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme, known as shedase, and the protein produced is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is in most organs: ACE2 is placed on the membrane of the primary alveolar lung cell type II, small-use enterositis, endothelial and vein cells, and muscle locus cells in most organs.
The expression mRNA ACE2 is also found in cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and the brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to balance ACE.
ACE divides angiotensin I hormone into angiotensin II vasoconstriction.
Finally, ACE2 cuts the amino phenylalanine terminal carboxylic acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and his hydrolysis is angiotensin (1-7) vasodilator (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also divide a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9] -bradikinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and greekin.
ACE2 also regulates the flow of the membrane transporter neutral amino acid SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 functions as the main entry point into the cell for some coronation viruses, which include HCV-NL63; SARS-COV (SARS virus); and SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19 virus).
More specifically, the binding of S1 protein to spikes or SARS-COV and SARS-COV2 to the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the cell surface results in endotoxicosis and translocation of viruses and enzymes into the endosome contained in the cell.
The process of entering this virus also requires a protein S prime by TMPRSS2, which is currently being investigated as potential therapy. This makes people hypothesizing that the sequence of ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, many professional societies and regulatory bodies recommend further therapy of ACE inhibitors and standard ARBs.
A systematic and meta-analysis survey, published on 11 July 2012, found that "the use of an ACE inhibitor results in a 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control."
Further, "the use of ACE inhibitors also lowers the risk of pneumonia in patients with higher risk for pneumonia, especially stroke and heart failure.
The use of an ACE inhibitor is also associated with the deaths related to pneumonia, although the result is less powerful than the risk of overall pneumonia."
ACE2 recombinant human (rhACE2) is expected to be a new therapy for acute lung injury, and appears to increase lung hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with an acute respiratory syndrome induced by lipoplicsaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 on humans is about 10 hours with a 30-minute shift beyond 24 hours.
Some findings show that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for patients with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or to disease with angiotensin II in increased blood circulation. Infus rhACE2 has been evaluated in a clinical trial for acute respiratory syndrome treatment.
The COVID-19 application is a cellular software application designed to help track contacts to remove the flagship of the 2019-2020 crown virus, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contact") that may have made contact with infected people.
Many applications have been developed or produced, which have received official government support in a number of areas and jurisdictions.
Several task boxes have been developed to build contact tracking applications.
The privacy problem was asked, especially regarding the system based on the location of the application's geographic location.
Alternatives that don't include too much privacy include using Bluetooth signal to record closeness with other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support the Bluetooth-based applications directly into Android and iOS operating systems.
In Tiongkok, the Tiongkok government, along with Alipay, has spread applications that allow citizens to check if they have contacted the suffering of COVID-19.
This application was used in more than 200 cities of Tiongkok. In Singapore, the application name TraceTogether is used.
This application was developed by the local IT community, released as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track the symptoms of infected potentials and respond quickly to health care authorities.
This application is developed by Communication, Technology, and Health.
Until April 14, 2020, the app is still awaiting Google Play Store and Apple App Store approval.
On 12 April, the government announced that the contact tracking application is in the process of further development and will be available for distribution within a few weeks. Similar applications were designed in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on TraceTogether Singapore applications and BlueTrace protocols. Russia means to introduce geofencing applications to patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow; it is designed to ensure they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security at Cambridge University, mentions a number of practical problems that may occur on an application-based system, which includes false positives and is likely to be less effective if the data taken is limited to only a small part of the population.
To overcome concerns about the preaching of misleading or dangerous “kronavirus” applications, Apple sets limits on the type of organization that can add associated “kronavirus” applications to the App Store, which is limited only to “resm” organizations or have a good reputation.
Google and Amazon apply similar limitations.
Private supporters expressed their concern about the involvement of mass surveillance using the coronary application, especially as to whether the surveillance infrastructure designed to deal with the coronary plague will be stopped after the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued statements calling for restrictions on this kind of surveillance.
This organization has eight requirements for government projects:
surveillance must be "according to law, necessity, and proportionality";
the need for monitoring and monitoring must have a fainted solar ear;
the use of data must be limited for the purpose of COVID-19;
the security and anonymity of the data shall be protected and proved on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance must avoid increasing discrimination and marginalisation;
any division of data with a third party shall be defined by law;
there must be protection against abuse and the right of nationals to respond to abuse;
Participation means all "my relevant stakeholders", which includes public health experts and the most marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) Germany and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also publish a checklist.
The resulting Google/Apple article means to deal with monitoring problems by removing the tracking mechanism from the device operating system once it is no longer necessary.
Some countries use network-based location trackers, not applications, to eliminate the need to remove applications and capabilities to avoid tracking.
In Israel, tracking was based on a network agreement.
A network-based solution that has access to essential location data has potential for significant privacy problems.
However, not all systems with a central server need access to personal location data; a number of privacy protection systems have been created and used by the central server only for communication (see below).
In South Korea, non-application systems are used to track contacts.
In exchange for using special applications, the system collects tracking information from various sources, includes cellular tracking data and card transaction data, and combines this information to produce notifications through text messages to the infected.
In addition to using this information to warn potential contacts, the government also makes the location information available to the public, which is permitted by a wide change in the privacy laws of the information after it is seized by the MERS in that country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries such as Germany consider using a targeted system while protecting privacy.
Until 6 April 2020, the details have not been clarified.
On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working on privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record user closeness with other phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a co-ordination effort that includes centralized and decentralised approaches, and not a single protocol. Decentralized protocol includes Close-to-Centralisation Protecting Privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Number (TCN, previously called Contact Chance Number, CEN), Protocol and Privacy Sensitive Mechanism for Cellular Contact Detection (PACT), and so on.
In this protocol, personal data that can be identified never leave the device, and all matching occurs on the device.
The Privacy Group at the Media Lab MIT develops SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-protective techniques when collecting and using location or area intersection data to track COVID-19.
This is based on a study of the White Band "Apps Gone Rogue: Keeping Personal Privacy in An Epidemic" which was launched in March 2020.Another effort is the safetrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that develops private technology and was also founded at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrack uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share location and sensitive health data with other users and officials without sacrificing the privacy of the data.
On 5 April 2020, the Global TCN Coalition was set up by groups that have the same approach as the most difficult protocol, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and allowing global interoperability for tracking and warning applications, which is a key aspect of achieving broad reception.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that they had made the BlueTrace protocol used by its government's official application as an open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, a company that controls Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative to track contacts, which they claim will protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy-protected cryptography.
They also publish the specifications of the basic technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is meant to be launched in three stages:
launch tools to allow governments to make official use of privacy-protected coronation virus tracking applications
the integration of this function directly into iOS and Android Google and Apple to deal with data pick-up and monitoring problems continues with the initial distribution of the system through the operation system update, then delete it the same way after the threat has passed.
b'Reposition of medicine (also called the granting of new purpose, new profile, or new task in medicine or alternative therapy) is the use of drugs approved for the purpose of new treatment, i.e. for a different disease or medical condition with the purpose of early development of medicine.
This path is a path of scientific research that is currently being carried out to develop a safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
Other studies include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and the transfer of conventional plasma. SARS-COV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be a drug target, each protein has several binding sites.
Analysis of these binding sites can be the basis of an effective antivirus drug development project for the COVID-19 protein.
Some of the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papaya-like protease, RNA polymerase-dependent RNA, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussein A A, et al examines some of the candidate's lifespans that were then optimized and analyzes the cause with a drug that has been approved and has the highest intelligence to accelerate the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 potent drugs in its praclinic studies to be recommended in clinical study design.

Governor New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that a test of chloroquin and hydrochloroquine in New York would begin on March 24th. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquin sulphate and phosphate chloroquin based on the Emergency Use Authorisation (USA).
This treatment is not yet approved by the FDA clinical trial and diotorization based on the United States as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients treated with malady, but cannot receive treatment in the clinical trial.
CDC said that "use, dose, or duration of hydroxychloroquin for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
Doctors say they use the medicine when there's no other choice.
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquins combined with spleen, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Major studies are being conducted at Duke University and at the University of Oxford.
The New Langone Medical School is conducting safety tests and preventive hydroxychloroquiin.
Thiongkok clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir was proved "effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen tested negative in the median of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive the medicine.
In a study conducted in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half of the patients received favipyravir and half received umifenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical body reminds the public that the evidence to support it is not much and too much today.
On April 2nd, Germany announced that it would buy the medicine from Japan for preparation and use by the military to send drugs to the university hospital, where drugs would be used to cure COVID-19 patients.

This medicine may not be safe when used by a pregnant mother or by someone who is trying to breast - feed.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Caletra), the combination of antivirus lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "there is no significant benefit".
This medicine is designed to inhibit the replication of HIV by binding protease.
A research team at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drug to find a life-long relationship to SARS-COV-2 protease.There are criticisms in the scientific community about resource guidance for drug reposition developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO incorporates lopinavir/ritonavir into international Solidarity testing.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences as a cure for Ebola virus and Marburg virus infection. Then, Gilead Sciences found that Remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against some philo-, pneumo-, paramix-, and coronaviruses.
One of the problems with antivirus treatment is resistance through mutations that can cause more disease and transmission.
Some early trials show that remdesivir may have a high genetic burden on resistance. There are some ongoing clinical trials, including two clinical trials carried out by the Cleveland University Hospital, one for people with disease and one for those with severe disease.
There are three clinical trials taking place for intravenous vitamin C for people who have been treated with low and severe COVID-19 disease, i.e. two controlled placebos (Tiongkok, Canada) and one without control (Italy).
The New York State started testing for azithromycin antibiotics on March 24, 2020.
Japanese National Centre for Health and Global Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial for Alvesco (cyclosonide) Teijin, an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, for the treatment of patients with pre-immune new coronation virus.
For an angiotensin 2 converting enzyme test phase II is being conducted with 200 patients being recruited from a severe case of fatal treatment in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to find out the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently examining the role of cholkisin in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, given the name COLCORONA, recruited 6,000 adults 40 years of age and older who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms that did not require care.
A woman who is pregnant or who is breast - feeding or who is not using effective contraception does not meet the requirements.
Some anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Heparin, a low - molecular botanist, used extensively to treat patients so that the Italian Medicines Agency could publish guidance on their use.
A multi-centre study in 300 patients who studied the use of enoxaparin sodium at the prophylaxis and therapeutic doses was published in Italy on April 14.
Because SARS-COV-2 is a virus, a lot of scientific attention is focused on providing new treatment for the antivirus that has been approved and developed for previous diseases, such as MRS, SARS, and West Nile.
Ribavirin: ribavirin is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the Tionkok 7 guide.
Umifenovir: umifenovir is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the Tionkok 7 guide.
Some antibiotics identified as potential drugs can be given new uses for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-receptor IL-6): Approved by Tiongkok.
In addition, try tests in Italy and Tiongkok, see also Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
b'COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetic vaccine for coronation virus 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has yet been completed in clinical trials, there are many efforts being made to develop the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, the vaccine against SARS-COV-2, the causative virus of this disease, will not be available within 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates are in Phase I security study in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
The great plague spread worldwide in 2020, leading to major research and investment to develop vaccines.
Many organizations use genomes published to develop vaccines that may be able to fight SARS-COV-2.
The CEPI initiative announced in April that what should be observed in the development of vaccines is speed, production capacity, the preaching on the necessary scale, and global access.
In April, CEPI researchers reported that 10 different technology platforms are in research and development during early 2020 to make effective vaccines against COVID-19.
The main platform target for the Phase I security study, including:
nucleate acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I development and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
vector virus (phase I development and candidate vaccine: CanSino Biologicals, vector adenovirus type 5)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (considered to be planned or planned).
Phase I-II tests perform the initial safety and immunogenicity tests, usually done randomly, controlled by placebo, and in some locations, with a more accurate effective dose.
Phase III testing usually involves more subjects, including control groups, and tests the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent disease, while monitoring side effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active vaccine candidates (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 are not yet in the human evaluation (also in the "practinis" study).
On January 24, 2020, University of Queensland in Australia announced that they are investigating the potential of a genetically-responsive molecular vaccine to modify the virus protein to induce an immune reaction.

On January 29, 2020, the Janssen Pharmaceutical Company, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they were beginning to develop vaccines.
Janssen works with his biotech partner, Vaxart, to develop an oral vaccine.
On March 18, 2020, the Emergency BioSolutions announced a production kit with Vaxart to develop a vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania then published the design of vaccines with similar technologies to those used for cancer vaccine therapy.
On March 25, the head of the research agency announced that they had completed the vaccine synthesis and would start testing.
On February 27, 2020, the children of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced they started a vaccine project to make a peptide Ii-Key vaccine against COVID-19.
They want to produce a vaccine candidate that can be tested on humans "in 90 days."
On March 5, 2020, the Washington University of St. Louis announced its project to develop vaccines.

in the development and manufacture of vaccines.
In addition, this study highlighted a preclinical and Phase I clinical test plan in July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Health Center announced that they are working 11 isolates, and even on a fast track, the development of vaccines at least takes about one and a half to two years.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotech company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported a partial screening of the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
This vaccine candidate is in laboratory research, with tests on humans planned in July or August 2020.
Early that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump has offered "big money" for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine to CureVac, which was protested by the German government.
On March 17, 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech, to jointly develop mRNA-based vaccines.
Currently, the vaccine-based candidate mRNA, BNT162, is in a preclinical trial with a clinical trial expected to start in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, the Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced that they would get the practinium test in April 2020 and the vaccine candidate in the final stage could start testing people in the back season.
On 19 March 2020 in France, the Innovation Coalition of the Epidemi Bureau (CEPI) announced a US$4.9 million investment in the COVID-19 vaccine research consortium, which includes the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Wina, Austria), and the Pittsburgh University, with a total ECI investment in the development of COVID-19 vaccines to reach US$29 million.
Other CEPI investments for the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University, and Queensland University.
On March 20, 2020, the Russian health office announced that scientists have started testing six vaccine candidates in animals.
Imperial College London researchers announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing an RNA vaccine that can amplify itself for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving a sequence from Tiongkok.
At the end of March, the government of Canada announced a total of C$275 million for 96 medical research projects against COVID-19, which included a number of vaccine candidates at companies and universities in Canada, such as the Medicago initiative and the University of Saskatchewan.
At almost the same time, the government of Canada announced C$192 million special funds to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, with a plan to establish a national vaccine bank containing some new vaccines that can be used if another coronary disease occurs.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the Pittsburgh University Medical Faculty reported a trial of PittCoVacc, a candidate for COVID-19 vaccine in rats; they said that "the MNA that gave the S1 SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine resulted in a specific antibody response that began to appear two weeks after immunization."
On April 16, 2020, the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Waterloo announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasopharyngeal protein.
Using bacteria, DNA is designed to replicate into human bacteria to produce particles like non-hazardous viruses, which can cause the immune system to produce antibodies to the SARS-COV-2 virus.
In March 2020, governments, industry, and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access supercomputers from IBM, combined with cloud computing sources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
That means that these vaccines can benefit from the outside of the disease that they're causing.
Further examinations in Australia have tried to follow in the footsteps of 4,170 health - care professionals.
There is a chance that vaccines in development will not be safe or effective.
Initial research to evaluate vaccine administration using specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic rats, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates, shows the need to step up the barrier to achieve the level of biological safety 3 in the management of life virus, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
The vaccine against SARS and MERS has been tested in a model of non-human animals.
Until 2020, there has been no cure or protection vaccine for SARS that has proved safe and effective to humans.
According to the research published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to cure SARS is a priority for public health authorities and governments around the world, and there is also no proven vaccine for MRS.
When MERS is prevalent, a sure SARS study can be a useful template for developing vaccines and therapy for MERS-CoV infection.
In March 2020, there was one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine that completed phase I clinical trials on humans, and three other vaccines are in the process, all of which are a virus vector vaccine, two adenovirus vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media outlets have mixed conspiracy theory that claims virus back to COVID-19 has been previously known and that the vaccine has been available.
Patents cut by various social media outlets refer to patents available for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronation viruses, such as SARS coronation.
b'Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) is a fungal disease caused by acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, itching, and breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle urticaria, diarrhea, throat disease, loss of breast - feeding power, and stomach pain.
From the dawn of the day to the wake of the symptoms in general, some five days may begin with a period of between two and fourteen days.
Although most cases lead to mild symptoms, some develop into virus pneumonia and organ failure.
By April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territorial areas, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured, especially during close contact with humans, often through small drops or drops produced by ingestion, convulsions, or speaking.
Although it is produced when breathing, the droplets usually fall to the ground or to the surface and do not wander to a distance.
People can also be infected by touching the contaminated surface and touching the eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, this virus can last up to 72 hours.
This virus is very volatile for the first three days after the symptoms, although the preaching may take place before the symptoms occur and after the next stage of the disease. The standard diagnostic method is with the real-time transcription chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on the nasopharyngeal hip.
The use of masks is encouraged for those who are expected to develop viruses and those who take care of them.
Recommendations on the use of masks by different public societies; some authorities recommend not to use masks, some recommend their use, and others recommend their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or antivirus treatment specific to COVID-19.
Local transmission of disease has been recorded in almost all countries in six WHO regions.
A person infected with virus can experience symptoms without symptoms or symptoms such as flu, such as fever, vomiting, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
The (immoral) signs include difficulty in breathing, drowsiness, confusion in the chests, confusion in body, and confusion in face, and in palpitations.
Upper respiratory symptoms, such as itching, swelling, or sore throat, can be found, but rarely.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, are observed in a different percentage.
Some cases in Tiongkok were initially only with the clinical description of the chest and palpitation.
In some cases, diseases can develop into pneumonia, organ failure, and death.
This time is called the incubation time.
The incubation time for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but it can start from two to 14 days.
97.5% of those infected will experience symptoms within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of undiagnosed carriers in the spread of the disease is not fully known; yet, early evidence shows that they may have contributed to the spread of the disease.
Currently, the proportion of infected people who do not show symptoms that are not yet known and are being examined, with the Korean Center for Control and Prevention of Disease (KCDC) reports that 20% of all confirmed cases remain undetected during hospital treatment.
The Tiongkok National Health Commission began reporting cases without symptoms in its case on 1 April; of the 166 infections on that day, 130 cases (78%) did not show symptoms at the time of testing.
Spouts and running water can carry the virus to a large extent.
Talking up to release more chips or drops than talking normally.
A study in Singapore found that an unscathed can cause a drop of up to 4.5 feet (15 m).
Although this virus is usually not released through the air, the United States National Academy of Science shows that bioaerosol transmissions may occur and air collection placed in an outdoor room produces a positive sample for the RNA virus.
Some medical procedures, such as the intubation and resuscitation of the lungs (RJP), can turn the respiratory secret into an aerosol and spread through the air.
While there is concern that the virus can spread through the faeces, the risk is believed to be low, the virus is the most devastating when people get sick; although the preaching work may take place before the onset of symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said that although it is not clear how easy this disease is to spread, one person in general is infected by two to three others.
In particular, it was found that the virus could be detected for one day on cardboard/cardus, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and hard coal (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies depending on the humidity and temperature.
Sabun and detergents are also effective if properly used; soap products deplete the protective tissue layer of the virus, deactivation of the virus, and release it from the skin and other surfaces.
Another route, such as benzalkonium chloride and gluconate chlorhexidine (medicine infection), is less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, a sample of liquid water was taken in the middle two days after treatment began.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest virus load, and the sixth patient showed the highest virus load on the second day test.
Coronavirus acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2) is a new acute breathing coronary syndrome, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with acute respiratory disease cluster in Wuhan.
All the new features of SARS-COV-2 are on the coronation virus that's close in nature.
Outside of the human body, this virus was killed by a domestic soap, which damaged its protective membranes. SARS-COV-2 was close to the first SARS-COV.
Pneumonia is the most common organ in COVID-19 due to the virus's primary cell access through the enzyme angiotensin 2 (ACE2), which is the most abundant in type II lung alveolar cells.
This virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spike or peplomer" to connect to ACE2 and enter the lead cell.
Acute heart damage was found at 12% of the infected people who were treated in Wuhan, Tiongkok, and more often in severe diseases.
High cardiovascular symptoms due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease development, but acute myocardial infarction may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
The ACE2 receptor is expressed as very high in the heart and is involved in the function of the heart.
Thrombosis events (31%) and high venereal thromboembolism (25%) were found in patients with COVID-19 infection in ICU and may be associated with poor prognosis. Otopsis in people who died because of COVID-19 found alveolar difus (DAD) damage and inflammatory infiltrate containing lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for respiratory epithelium cells expressing ACE2, patients with COVID-19 are overweight with systemic hyperinflammatory symptoms.
In particular, T cells that dissecrate the GM-CSF pathogen have been shown to be corroborated with monosit dissected IL-6 inflammatory and severe pulmonary pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphotic infiltrates have also been reported to autopsy.
WHO has published some test protocols for this disease.
The standard test method is the real-time polymerase transcription chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually carried out on a breath sample obtained by means of a nasopharyngitis; however, a nose or a spit sample may also be used.
In general, the results are available in a few hours or two.
Although blood tests can be used, two samples taken two weeks at a time may be required to produce a small amount of time.
The Tionkok scientist was able to isolate this coronavirus and publish its genetic sequences so that the laboratory around the world could develop an independent polymerase chain reaction test (PCR) to detect infection by this virus.
On April 4, 2020, an antibody test (which can detect active infection and if someone has previously been infected) is under development, but not much is being done.
Tiongkok’s experience with the test showed only 60 to 70 percent accuracy.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care test on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of that month. The diagnostic guidance provided by the Zhongnan University Hospital Wuhan suggests a method to detect infection based on clinical imaging and epidemiological risk.
The ground-glass opacity of a bilateral multilobar with peripheral distribution, asymmetry, and later many found at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural domination, crazy paving, and consolidation can occur along the path of disease development.
A little data is available on microscopic lesions and COVID-19 pathophysiology.
The main pathology finding at the autopsy is:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation, and pulmonary oedema
Four types of pneumonia viruses can be observed:
light pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pulmonary hyperplasia, large atypical pneumosis, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration, and the formation of giant cells means a lot
Severe pneumonia: alveolar difus (DAD) damage with alveolar difus exodus.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Pneumonia in the recovery phase: exudation in the alveolar corner and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: intravascular coagulation diseminate (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Steps to reduce the possibility of infection include staying at home, avoiding many places, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good breathing hygiene, and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends that the mouth and nose should be closed with the tissue when it is sneezing or sneezing and recommending the use of parts in the tissue if the tissue is not available.
Hygiene is the proper hand that is used to stimulate the growth of a person’s body.
The CDC recommends the use of face coverings from public places, partly to limit the circulation of people without symptoms. The social limitation strategy is aimed at reducing the contact of people infected with many, by closing schools and jobs, limiting travel, and canceling large-scale meetings in public places.
Limitation instructions also include keeping at least six feet [6 m] or six feet [1.8 m] in length.
There is no known effective cure to prevent COVID-19. Since the vaccine is expected not to exist until the early 2021, the main part of managing COVID-19 is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, known as "declaring the curve".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after the toilet or when the hands are dirty, before eating, and after brushing their nose, throat, or lips.
Furthermore, the CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based handicraft containing at least 60% of alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In areas where commercial handicrafts are not available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
Peroxide hydrogen is used to help remove bacterial spores in alcohol; this substance is "not an active substance for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as humectane.
People are treated with supportive care, which can include liquid therapy, oxygen support, and other emerging vital organs.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect them bring viruses to wear a simple facial mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to cope with respiratory failure, but its benefits are still considered.
Self - cleaning and lifestyles and healthy eating patterns are recommended to improve immunity.
The WHO and the Tiongkok National Health Commission have published recommendations to deal with the loss of COVID-19.
Intensifiers and lung doctors in the United States have put in place recommendations for treatment from various agencies to be a free source of power, i.e. IBCC.
Until April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical powers are more recommended than ibuprofen for first line use.
Preventive action should be taken to minimise the risk of virus leakage, especially in health care settings when performing procedures that may produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For the health power that manages COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in the Air Toll Insulation Room (AIR) other than using standard prevention, contact prevention, and air prevention. The CDC provides guidance for the use of self-protection devices during exposure.
The recommended equipment is: APD clothes, a breathing agent or a facial mask, a protective eye, and a medical gloves. If available, a breathing agent (not a facial mask) is better.
The N95 Respirator is approved for industrial settings, but the FDA has authorized this mask to be used according to the U.S. Emergency Use Authorisation.
The N95 respiratory system is designed to protect from dust - like - air particles, but the effectiveness of certain biological agents is not guaranteed for use that is not mentioned on the label.
If a mask is not available, the CDC recommends using a face protection or, as a last effort, a self-made mask.
Most of the COVID-19 case is not too heavy until it needs mechanical or alternative ventilation, but most cases are very heavy.
The type of breathing support for people who have failed to breathe associated with COVID-19 is currently being examined for people who have lost their sleep, and there is evidence that the intubation can be avoided by means of a high flow tube or positive air pressure.
It is not known whether one of these two methods works in the same way for the sufferer.
Most doctors prefer to keep using invasive mechanical ventilation, when available, because this technique restricts the preaching of particulate aerosols compared to high flow ducts.
Many advanced countries don't have a hospital bed per paroled captain, who limits the health system's capacity to deal with the sudden number of COVID-19 cases that are severe enough to require care.
A study in Tiongkok found that 5% of intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In Tiongkok, about 30 percent of the COVID-19 sufferers were eventually treated into the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex following the acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) occurs at COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Fans that are able to do pressure control mode and high PEEP are needed to maximize oxygen transmission and minimize the risk of lung damage and associated pneumotorax.
A high PEEP may not be available on an old fan.
Studies on treatment potentials started in January 2020 and some antivirus drugs are being tested in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drug developments may take up to 2021, some of the drugs being tested have been approved for other uses or have been tested further.
Antiviral drugs can be tested in people with severe diseases.
Volunteers who recommend WHO are also involved in an effective testing and potential treatment security. The FDA has provided temporary authorisation for conventional plasma as experimental treatment in the case of a person's very or very dangerous life.
Convalescence plasma has not yet been conducted in clinical studies necessary to prove its safety and efficacy for this disease.
In February 2020, Tiongkok launched a cellular application to deal with this disease.
User is asked to enter their name and ID number.
This application is able to detect 'near contact' using surveillance data so that it can detect the risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
If the risk is detected, applications not only recommend bathing quarantine, but also inform local health officials. Data analysis on mobile data, facial detection technology, cell tracking, and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those who contact them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government permitted a security body to track the expected person’s cell phone records.
The steps are taken to treat quarantine and to protect those who may be in contact with the infected.
In addition, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom divided the phone location data into the German federal government body Robert Koch Institute, which examined and prevented the spread of the virus.
Russia uses facial detection technology to detect quarantine offenders.
Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera said he was informed by the mobile operator that "40% of the population are still moving".
The German government is doing a 48-hour hack at the end of the week with over 42,000 people.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, has made a global call for a creative solution to the fight against the spread of coronation.
People may experience stress from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects, or fear of infection themselves.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "The increase in social isolation, loneliness, health problems, stress, and economic downturn is a perfect storm that endangers mental health and public health."
This disease can take place with little or no symptoms, which are similar to those of other common respiratory diseases, such as pyrexia.
A minor case is usually healed within two weeks, while those who suffer from severe illness or crisis may need three to six weeks to recover.
A pregnant woman may have a higher risk for COVID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is still less.
In the worst, COVID-19 can rapidly develop into an acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) that causes respiratory failure, septic shock, or organ failure.
Complication related to COVID-19 including sepsis, abnormal blood clotting, and heart, kidney, and heart damage.
Blood clotting, especially prothrombin time increase, was observed in 6% of patients treated with COVID-19, while renal dysfunction was seen in 4% of these groups.
About 20-30% of people with a COVID-19 picture show a transaminases.
According to the same report, the median time between symptoms and death was ten days, with five days spent in heaven.
However, patients transferred to the ICU have a median of seven days between the treatment of blindness and death.
In a study that examines early cases, the median time began from early until death is 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) Tiongkok, men have a death rate of 2.8%, while women have a death rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examination of postmortem lung samples shows alveolar damage fumes with cellular fibromyxoid exodus on both lungs.
The cytopathic changes of the virus are seen in the pneumocytes.
The picture of the lungs is similar to the acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
At 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission, Tionkok, a heart attack, with an increase in troponin levels or a heart arrest.
According to data from March of the United States, 89% of those who are treated have a lead condition, and the availability of medical and social resources in an area can also affect mortality.
Mortality estimates vary from condition to region, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Fewer cases can cause the number of deaths to be counted too high.
However, the fact that death is the result of a case in the past can mean that the number of deaths at present is too low.
Protococcals have the potential of 1.4 times greater COVID-19 symptoms and about 2.4 times more may require intensive care or death than non-protococcal.
The Hong Kong Hospital authorities found a 20% to 30% reduction in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung scans showed organ damage.
This can also lead to an intensive treatment syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it is not yet known whether previous infections provide effective and long-term immunity to those who are cured of this disease.
Immunization may be obtained if you see another coronavirus behavior, but there have been reports of a cure of COVID-19 followed by positive coronavirus tests a few days later.
This case is believed to be a worsening infection, not a re-infection.
This virus is expected to come naturally and come from animals, through widespread infection.
In fact, in December 2019, the spread of infection was largely driven by human migration.
A study on 41 confirmed cases of the first COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest date of receipt of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
The official publication of the WHO reported the earliest hit on December 8, 2019.
In general, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
These numbers vary from region to region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health care system, the management options, the time since the first disease, and the character of populations such as age, type of pregnancy, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO established an ICD-10 emergency U07.1 for death due to SARS-COV-2 infection confirmed by the laboratory and U07.2 for death due to COVID-19 clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed without laboratory confirmation for SARS-COV-2 infection.
According to statistics at Johns Hopkins University, the death rate for the overall case is 6.9% (153,822/2,240.191) on 17 April 2020.
Other measurements include the number of fatalities (CFRs), reflecting the percentage of the diagnosed people who died from certain diseases, and the number of infected people who died from certain diseases (IFRs), the percentage of the infected (diagnosis and non-diagnosis).
These statistics are timeless and follow a particular population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people make antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information on the number of people infected.
In the outbreak of the disease in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 people, 80 (1.7%) have died.
In Gangelt, this disease was spread through the Carnival festival, which spread to young people, caused relatively lower mortality, and probably not all COVID-19 deaths were classified as COVID-19 deaths.
Further, the German health system has not yet been controlled.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, as studied by a blood donor.
69 people (0.004 per cent of the population) were convicted of having died of COVID-19.
The effects of the pandemic and the level of mortality are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in the studies conducted in Tiongkok and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in the '50s, with different risks between men and new women not appearing in the '90s.
In Tiongkok, the death rate for men is 2.8 percent and for women is 1.7 percent.
The reason for this type of pregnancy is certainly not known, but genetic factors and behavior may be reasons.
Immunologous differences based on the type of pregnancy, lower prevalence of smoking in women, and men with comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, in their younger years than women, can contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected are men and 72% are dead because COVID-19 is men.
By April 2020, the US government did not track the related type of pregnancy data for COVID-19 infection.
Research shows that virus diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
As a percentage of women’s pregnant health officials, especially nurses, have a higher chance to spread the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of this disease is "COVID-19".
WHO leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explains that CO is a short for the crown, VI for the virus, D for the disease, and 19 for the first time the disease was identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to certain geographical locations (e.g. Tiongkok), animal species, or a group of people, consistent with international recommendations for preventing stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is given the name of the coronavirus acute breathing syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in public communication.
Both the disease and the larynx virus are referred to as "coronavirus".
At the beginning of Wuhan's disease, Tiongkok, the virus and the disease are called "coronavirus" and "coronavirus Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov as a temporary name for viruses and diseases in line with the 2015 guide to avoid using the location name in the name of the disease and virus.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-COV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Because of the limited capacity in the standard market chain, some digital manufacturers have printed health care materials such as nasal hoses and fan components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital really needs a ventilator lid, and the cooker cannot provide the necessary timescale, a local company would turn around and print 100 needed lids last night.
After the beginning of the COVID-19 disorder, conspiracy theory, misinformation, and information appeared about origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease, which spread rapidly.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of virus replication in pigs, pigs, and chickens.
No medicine or vaccine has been approved to cure this disease.
International research on vaccines and COVID-19 drugs is being carried out by government organizations, academic groups, and industry research.
In March, the World Health Organization conducted "SOLIDARITY Trial" to investigate the effects of the treatment of four antivirus lifetimes that have been most promising.
Vaccines are not yet available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous studies on SARS-COV were used by SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 simultaneously using the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies under review.
First of all, the research is aimed at making a whole virus vaccine.
The use of the virus, either inactive or dead, is intended to rapidly trigger the immune response of the human body to the new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, a subunit vaccine, is aimed at creating a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain subunits in the virus.
In the case of SARS-COV-2, the study focuses on S-spike protein that helps the virus bind the enzyme ACE2 receptor.
The third strategy is a nuclear acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, new vaccination technique).
The experimental vaccine made with these strategies must be tested to find safety and fitness. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine started with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains non-hazardous genetic codes that are copied from the virus that causes the disease, and the increase in antibodies has been recommended as a potential challenge for the development of SARS-COV-2, but this method is still controversial.
There are over 300 active clinical trials taking place in April 2020.
Seven trials tested the treatment that has been approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Antivirals that have recently been administered form most of Tiongkok's studies, with nine Phase III tests on redecivir in some countries with high reporting time at the end of April.
In April 2020, there was a dynamic analysis of clinical development for vaccine candidates and COVID-19 drugs.A number of antivirals currently being evaluated for treatment with COVID-19, which included remdesivir, chloroquin and hydroxychloroquin, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir were combined with interferon beta.
In March 2020, there was temporary evidence for redecivir.
Increases in clinical trials were observed in patients treated with redecivir in emergency treatment.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, Tiongkok, and Italy. Chlorokuin, previously used to treat malaria, was examined in Tiongkok in February 2020 with early results.
However, there is an appeal for a visit to the research.
Korea's Health Authority and Tiongkok recommend the use of chloroquin.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, notes that twice a dose is very dangerous and can kill.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorisation for hydroxychloroquin and chloroquin over the policy of a doctor who manages the suffering of COVID-19.The 7th edition of Tiongkok also announced interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir to be used against COVID-19.
Initial data show that a high dose of ribavirin is required to inhibit SARS-COV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanid has been recommended for further in vivo studies after showing SARS-COV-2 service at low concentration.A study shows that early priming against the tonol protein by serum protease transmembrane 2 (TMPRSS2) is very important for entering SARS-COV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquin and hydroxycloquin with or without azithromycin have a major limitation that has prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-COV-2 in vitro and has no known role in COVID-19 therapy.
Sytokinic storm complications can occur on COVID-19 heavy further.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have antisytokine properties. Tocilizumab has been included in the medical guide by the Tiongkok National Health Commission after a small study has been completed.
This medicine is doing phase 2 accidents at national level in Italy after showing positive results to people with severe diseases.
Combined with serum ferritin blood tests to identify the sitokin storm, this medicine is meant to fight the sitokin storm, which is expected to cause death to some people who are affected.
In 2017, interleukin-6 receptor antagonists were approved by the FDA on the basis of a retrospective case study for the treatment of steroid refractory stokin syndrome induced by different causes, i.e. CAR T cell therapy.
So far, there is no random and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an appropriate cure for CRS.
Transferting the cleaned and placed antibodies produced by the system of people who have been cured from COVID-19 to those who need it is being examined as a passive non-vaccination immunization method.
This strategy has been tried for SARS with inconclusive results.
Neutralization of the virus is a mechanism of work expected for passive antibody therapy that can mediate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, another mechanism, such as cellular cytotoxicity, which depends on antibodies and/or phagosytics, is also possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
Convalescence serum production, which is part of the fluid of the patient's blood that has been healed and contains specific antibodies to this virus, can be improved for faster use.
Coronavius disease, a group of associated syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Center Hospital, who later became infected and died because of COVID-19 after the outbreak of awareness of the spread of the virus.
