UN chief states there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict that lasts almost five years and more weapons would only make the violence and suffering of millions worse.
The UN chief again asked all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unify and support the negotiations in order to find a political solution.
Ban said Wednesday at a conference that he intends to meet with foreign ministers from five permanent countries present in the Council - the United States, Russia, China, England and France - on the outskirts of the General Assembly ministerial session to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that the divisions in the council and between the Syrian people and the regional powers "have made this unresolved situation".
Ban asked the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity when they managed to conclude an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 numbers of surveys showing Donald Trump has real chances
Some have tried to label him as a flip-flop politician.
Others called him a joke.
And others are waiting for implode.
But no matter how some Republicans try to get Donald Trump from the top of the polls, it didn't work (still).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys showed that Donald Trump is leading by a percentage of two digits, and some voices are starting to wonder seriously what this means for the chances of appointing the real estate.
Of course, it's still premature.
None of them say Trump will win the race for the nomination of Republicans.
Pundits shows that, in the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's progress took place with Herman Cain in the polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination.
And the reasons why it would be hard to fight in general elections are numerous.
But external groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Economic Conservative Group Club for Growth admit Trump's power and start supporting him with money.
We continue to show you a few figures from the recent survey that suggests that the real estate is not just something transient:
The figures that indicate support for Trump have returned to 180 degrees.
Even before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate.
By mid-July, the percentage had risen to 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Currently, six out of 10 Republicans have a favourable opinion about Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 says they have a negative opinion.
These numbers are kept.
A survey conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60% of the Republicans in the region have a favourable opinion on Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the nomination race.
In a survey conducted last week by CNN/ORC, 67% of Republicans said they would be "enthusiast" or "thank you" if Trump won the nomination race.
Only two out of 10 say it would be "supply" if Trump won the nomination race.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they would be "enthusiasms" against 40% who say the same thing about Trump).
The closest to enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, with only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say they would be "unsatisfied" or "supply" if Jeb Bush's favorite wins the nomination race.
Most Republicans don't consider Trump's temperament a problem.
Although Donald Trump has been strongly criticized for his offensive and bombastic style, 52% of Republican voters at the national level consider that the real estate has the right temperament to be president, according to a survey conducted on Monday by ABC News/Washington Post.
We find the same figures in Iowa, where 52% of Republicans believe Trump has the right personality to be a leader, according to a survey conducted last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% feel that he does not have the personality necessary to act efficiently and almost six out of 10 independent states that his temperament has nothing to look for in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When I take the intellectual attitude, the Republican voters consider Trump authentic.
According to a survey carried out last week by CNN/ORC, four out of 10 said Trump had the most chance to win the GOP nomination race.
The situation changed toward the end of July, when four out of 10 were betting on Jeb Bush.
Full information: In the past, GOP voters did not read the future very well.
In the same period of the last elections, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry in the nomination race, compared to only 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that the majority of GOP electors consider Trump's campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans or relegated to another candidate, Trump is still in front of everyone.
Some voices say the divided situation will probably contribute to Trump's victory, while Trump's support will be shared by more than twelve candidates.
However, a survey conducted at the beginning of September at the University of Monmouth shows that, in the hypothetical situation of cooperation between Trump and the majority of other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from majority support.
Trump is 13 points away from Carly Fiorina, 14 points from Marco Rubio, 15 points from Walker, 19 points from Jeb Bush and finally 33 points from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's almost equal to Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman with 19 points in a hypothetical confrontation from one to the next.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they've decided.
A new survey conducted on Tuesday by CBS/NYT shows that more than half of the voters who support Trump declare that they do not change their voting option.
Obviously, a lot can happen in this sense and no one can say that they will never change.
46% say they leave the door open to change their option.
However, Trump's most important opponent is now Ben Carson's neurosurgeon, but it's twice as likely that voters who say they've decided to vote with Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say I agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "violators" in his opening speech two months ago, immigration was the main topic in the campaign for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bomb style will lead to a division between important Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and will damage rebranding efforts.
However, according to a survey conducted on Monday by ABC/Post, six out of 10 Republicans claim to agree with Trump on immigration.
So it seems that as long as the problem of immigration remains in the light of the reflectors, so will Doland Trump.
Frustration of authorities is reaching new peaks.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by nearly half of the Republican voters, largely due to their status as outsiders.
According to a survey conducted on Monday by ABC/Post, six out of 10 Republicans claim to prefer a political outside to someone with government experience.
People are also angry with the Washington authorities.
A survey conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the performance of the Congres Republicans, 54% declaring themselves "unrejoiced" and 21% "unsatisfied".
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been long awaited
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will later make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions, confronting David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbyn will address the first of the six questions he has the right to shortly after lunch; his performance will probably be analyzed almost by the media and Labour MPs.
As part of his weekly appearances, he asked for "less theatre and more facts".
He also said he could give up some of his participations and give up on his colleagues.
The confrontation will be Mr. Corbyn's first parliamentary test as leader, coming after he called a "phantom cabinet" and after his speech delivered on Tuesday at the annual TUC Congress.
Meanwhile, the leader of the Labour Party's decision to remain silent on the face of national immunity in a job held on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England attracted critics from conservative parliamentarians and held the first page of the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr. Corbyn said that he "kept silence respectfully" and acknowledged "the heroism of the British Air Force in the Battle of England."
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's ghost cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight broadcast that he would have recommended that the Labour leader sing the national nom "indifferent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around twelve ministers from the phantom cabinet refused to be part of Mr. Corbyn's front team, arguing by differences of opinion regarding the economy, defence and foreign, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant states that the political differences "cumulate" in the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn's appointment on his position towards the European Union and limited benefits.
Mr Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party will bring about changes to completely eliminate the idea of restraint.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, Minister of Labour and Pensions, said the party "is very clear" in the exclusive opposition to the government's plans to reduce the "head" level from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to meet David Cameron at the tribunal in the last decade, since he took over the lead of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas "from external sources" for questions to address to Mr Cameron and that he has received more than 30,000 suggestions.
Parliamentlor Islington North said that PMQs involves too high a level of confrontation and that it will refrain from replicating and attacking, focusing on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.
Mr. Corbyn said Angela Eagle, Minister of Finance, will hold office at PMQs when he cannot participate - for example when Mr. Cameron moves abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to take the floor on occasion, saying that he had approached the President of the Chamber of Deputies, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he took the lead, Mr Cameron said he wanted to give up the political style "Punch and Judy" associated with PMQs, but he often acknowledged several years later that he failed in his move.
Since its first transmission in 1990, PMQs has been considered a key barometer of a leader's reasoning, the way in which it leads the Chamber of Deputies and its position among parliamentary colleagues, although criticism has claimed that it has become a cartoon and that it needs a profound reform.
"Framework in Joburg": Young people without shelter benefit from photography courses
It's hard to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets in childhood found a way to learn a trade and earn their lives.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches young people without shelter to take pictures of the areas where they live and earn money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
Chief JD Sports says higher wages could damage the expansions
President JD Sports Peter Cowgill states that an increase in the UK's minimum wage could mean "a greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
However, it is unlikely that that purchasing power would exceed the higher costs for the labour force within the firm, he says.
Costs could have an impact on JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean less new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Dennis Australia, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a side victim in the "futuruna" created around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior deserves better praise and not criticism, in the opinion of President Dennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the youngest part of the talented duo often called "Special Ks," was unsatisfied in the light of the scandalous reflections that Kyrgios had against Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
In a game of qualifiers played shortly after, in the Cincinnati, the chair arbitrator had to intervene twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after Harrison said: “Wawrinka should have put him on the ground in Kyrgyz, and I should have put him on the ground in this kid.”
Although he was last seen doing a dust rocket after he had muscle cramps and missed a possible US Open tournament, angry Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was strongly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth for the place two to one, after Bernard Tomic in the semifinal of the Davis Cup against England.
"One thing I feel strongly about is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was attracted to a little in conflict," Healy said.
The truth is, he broke a rocket when he lost because he accused the US of seizures, but it's not the first player to break a rocket from frustration on his own and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he wouldn't be proud of it.
But to be serious, it has been very well mastered in quite challenging situations in the US with Harrison and so on and I think it deserves a lot of trust.
He's got an extraordinary team, he's got a great family together, and I think he's been treated unfairly.
He is a 19-year-old very mature, he works hard and has joined the team, he has had no kind of conflict with the other players, he is very respected in dress, he is trained hard, he is in an excellent form, he is a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged exclusively on the basis of his qualities and weaknesses.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgyz into account for the important resignation game, which starts on Friday, and described the "common decision" as the most appropriate for all, but supported the return of the original player from Canberra in the long term in the team.
"First of all, we want the team to concentrate fully on the surrender game and not to think at all about the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick came up very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray said, he's matured under the public eye and made some terrible mistakes and deserves to be criticized, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and I think he needs a time when he's not in the center of attention to be able to reflect, good work for both the team and for him.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Bernie Sanders has been reduced to half in national polls
The former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, still has a two-digit advantage in the democratic run for national candidacy, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins the field.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of democratic voters (down from 58%), while Sanders is on two, with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for the presidency, is supported by 15% of the democratic voters.
At least five months before the start of the primary elections, the majority of democratic voters say it is too early to say that they have decided on the candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more firm in their choice than the supporters of other candidates.
Faced with the CBS survey conducted last month, Clinton lost land in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won a few percent.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has been reduced.
Support among men has decreased considerably and Sanders is only 5 points away.
Clinton's advantage among democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, now being equal to Sanders.
However, Clinton is still in favour of senior voters.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders, with a percentage of two figures, among the liberals, but Sanders now has a slight advantage of 5 points in this group.
Approximately half of democratic voters at the national level declare that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if she were chosen to run on behalf of the party.
One quarter would support some reserved and another 15% would support it just because it is the party.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Clinton’s current supporters are likely to be enthusiastic about its choice.
Opinions are more mixed up among those who do not currently support Clinton - just about a quarter would support it with enthusiasm.
While 48% of democratic voters say they would be enthusiastic about Clinton, the number of Republican voters who say the same thing about the first class is lower, Donald Trump (35%).
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question about why she would like to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this function (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these aspects and eligibility is also mentioned.
In view of the fact that the vice-president takes into account a possible presidential candidate, 57% of the democratic electors would like to see him in the race - although a third would not think he should run.
On the question of the second option for the party representative, democratic voters call Biden a majority.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half say Biden would be the second option, much before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Sanders grows from 20 points to 30 points if he doesn't.
55% of democratic voters consider Clinton the candidate with the highest chance to win the general election; however, the figures fell from 78% last month.
Biden is at a distance in place two but the percentage according to which he is the most eligible has grown.
However, when asked what is most important to an elected candidate, democratic voters prefer problems instead of eligibility.
Like last month, no democratic or possibly candidate is considered by these voters to be unacceptable as a party representative in the presidential run.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are well dealt with in terms of some key features to their party's primary voters.
Most electors consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be integrity and trust and have solid leadership qualities.
Biden is the best of all three in terms of integrity, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of the democratic voters do not believe that H. Clinton is integrated and trustworthy, twice as much as those who say this about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not have an opinion on him in this regard.
Democratic voters also generally consider that the three Clintons, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideologies as they do.
With regard to all these aspects, approximately a quarter of the democratic voters do not have an opinion on Sanders.
As questions persist regarding the use of a personal e-mail address and a server by Hillary Clinton when he was Secretary of State, the majority of democratic electors are grateful for its explanation of the subject and say that he did not affect the general opinion of the candidate.
But things are different for the American public.
Half of the Americans are unhappy now with her explanation, while only about a third are happy.
The public opinion was divided into March on this subject, shortly after the issue came to an end.
Most Americans say that this email-related dispute did not affect Clinton's general view, although 36% said they had changed their view in a negative way.
Most Republicans, more than six out of 10, say they have changed their opinion about Clinton in a negative way.
Although democratic voters consider Clinton to be complete and reliable, this issue continues to raise problems among voters at the general level: only 32% consider it complete and reliable, with 8% less than last month and 15% less than in May.
62% of voters do not consider it to be complete and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of voters at the national level do not consider Trump to be complete and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Among the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson and Bush are first classified as regards integrity.
The number of those who consider Sanders to be integral is greater than those who are not of the same opinion, however, as in Carson's case, many do not have an opinion on him.
The margin of error for the 351 primary democratic voters sample is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the federation accused of killing a student in the year 1 at the Faculty of Baruch
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people were accused of murder.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Fration at the Baruch Faculty in New York brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an opening ceremony in September 2013 and delayed to take him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
Official sources say that the victim was eye-bound, put a 14 kg sandbag behind him, and was repeatedly crushed as he tried to get to a destination on a frozen land.
Mr. Deng accused him of headaches after losing his knowledge.
The Pi Delta Psi brothers didn't call the emergency number after he fainted and claimed he'd waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, the police say.
However, they found the time needed to change Deng's clothes, search for his symptoms on Google and contact Andy Meng, the president of the frat at the national level, to ask for his advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide personal property and put the welfare of the frat before Michael Deng's welfare," Wagner said.
He couldn't be resurrected and died the second morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated trauma to his head, trunks and thighs.
"Many families have been devastated by the rituals of the brothers, since 1970 at least one student has lost his life every year because of the rituals," Douglas Fierberg, Deng's lawyer, said in a statement.
Their brothers and members must be held accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The Grand Jury of the Monroe District recommended that the first five members be charged with a three-degree crime.
Other thirty-two members of the fray, including Mr Meng, will also be charged with ultra-violet and complicated crime.
"We want to take responsibility not only for the people involved, but if there is an organisation that has authorized the frat, either officially or informally, we will also take responsibility," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch Faculty banned the fragility and the national fragility withdrew its membership with local representation.
This is what will happen when the Federal Reserve increases the interest rate
The interest rate will rise and the market bull (growth market) will grow, the profitability of the bonds will increase and the economy will fall.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it will happen and how long it will last.
In economics, history provides little indication of time frame..
After the first increase in the interest rate, the recession occurred in only 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates is often, although not always, a determining factor in how the economy responds and financial assets.
Therefore, U.S. central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on the moment when the interest rate is beginning to increase but on the time period needed for normalisation.
In fact, there are multiple variables in the game.
Finally, however, market players might find that all the tension associated with the increase in the interest rate has been exaggerated.
"The first increase in the interest rate decided by the Fed after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some voices as a sign of the existence of "cheap banks," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note addressed to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal levels, but it is still small to be the seismic shock that everyone seems to fear.
But it cannot be said that there will be no effect.
We continue to show how several sectors of the economy could react, based on historical trends:
In view of the situation in the market in recent months, the early rise in the interest rate may be volatile for a time.
But at the moment of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency to stagnate the profitability of the capital for 12-24 months after the first growth, which may again reflect the flaw in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed increases.
More precisely, in the last 35 years, the market has grown rapidly - with about 14 percent - towards increasing the interest rate, fairly unvariable over 250 days after (average 2.6% recovery) after it returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by the head of the Nuveen Asset Management strategy.
Deutsche said that the impact on the actions tends to become more pronounced later in the interest rate growth cycle and the benefits are beginning to drop.
The recession is a reality of economic life but increasing the interest rate often contributes to it.
In the face of the situation, the Fed faces certain conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
In particular, the gross domestic product will approach its historical minimum point for an increase in the Fed interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, nominal GDP was only twice as low as 4.5%.
Although in the second quarter of 2015 the value was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, reaching only 1.5% in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
The increase in the interest rate in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question "if this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market players have been prepared all year round for a decision to grow by Fed, all eyes being focused on meeting this week of the Federal Open Market Commission, which is closing on Thursday.
Although many strategies and economists believe that FOMC could approve an increase in the interest rate on the occasion of this meeting, transactions over time indicate only a 25% probability.
"In our study conducted after 1950, all the interest rate growth cycles so far have been in a super profit growth cycle, the GDP eclipsed the peaks before the recession very soon after the start of recovery," the report said.
On the contrary, it was a strange slow recovery after the most severe recession of the period analyzed.
The current cycle is far longer expected by Fed since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and it reached 74 months and continues.
The fixed income was also volatile given that the market anticipates an increase in the interest rate and the type is somewhat similar to that of the dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster in the case of obligations than in the case of actions where the Fed modifies policy.
In the case of obligations, the benefits appear to change the direction as soon as the first growth/decrease occurs.
At the end of the growth cycle of the interest rate, the profitability of the bonds is falling immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab's strategies are of the opinion that these increases in the interest rate will determine the approach to profitability between short-term and long-term obligations by applying the curve.
High-efficiency obligations are better handled in such an environment, although "we are still careful about strengthening profitability," said Kathy Jones, a permanent income analyst in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones is of the opinion that markets have already adapted to Fed's policy expectations.
"In addition to the dollar power and the estimated decline in inflation, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the perspective of a more rigorous monetary policy," Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have increased, the profitability curve is fairer, the average credit interest rate spread has increased and volatility has increased - all market characteristics when the Fed takes politics.
In large lines, companies carrying out majority business in the US will have to earn as a result of the increase in the interest rate and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with large debts will suffer because the increase in the dollar will lead to the savings of their products in the global market and their debt will be more expensive.
"History shows that "quality stocks" tend to be more profitable within three months of an initial increase in the interest rate," analyst Goldman Sachs said in a customer report.
Strong-balance-sheet firms exceeded those with a weak balance sheet after each of the 1994, 1999 and 2004 interest rate increases with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with large capital inflows and low-volatility stocks also exceeded similar companies with lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points), respectively 3 (percentage points).
The debt will become an important problem.
Companies with a large floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also be profited from the increase in the dollar.
Economists could also have won, although experts do not agree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy after Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticised the radio station for "simplying"
It says it is increasingly similar to the commercial opponent
He also took into account BBC Music Awards, claiming that the Brits prizes have been awarded
Colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice, claiming that this show is not original either
BBC Radio 3 is "transformed into" Classic FM, said an important parliamentary, putting pressure on the post to prove that it does something that commercial posts don't do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the heads of the BBC that the public radio station "simplysed" and looks more and more like the commercial opponent.
"I have the impression that Radio 3 "simplyses" - although I don't like using the word - but I have the impression that it turns into Classic FM," he said.
He also took into account BBC Music Awards, released last December.
BBC Music Awards, released last year, seem to be Brits under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are the two examples that come to my mind that I'm only doing to copy what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The director-general of the BBC has denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is very much in front of its commercial opponent with regard to live music and public education.
I'm not gonna find out anything about classical music I know from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
"In addition, I think it is also important to commit Radio 3 to discover new music and assign new songs," he said.
In the first part of this year, BBC editor Radio 3, Alan Davey, said he had to make more efforts to attract the audience from the previous period because the British have less knowledge of classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only item under the BBC seal criticised in the meeting of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport because it would follow its commercial rivals.
Conservative Parliamentarian Damien Collins attacked The Voice - a gift show purchased by BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media for about 22 million pounds of sterling.
Do you understand why there are often discussions about that issue because it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - having Paloma Faith and Boy George in jury - be performed "in a specific way to BBC."
He added that he wanted that Corporation to "find the chicken with a golden egg in its own garden" next time he launched a show of entertainment.
However, he refused to prohibit the future from taking over new seasons from The Voice or spending money on licenses in other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales recorded the smallest growth in August and guilty could be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
In the last month, the slowest growth since 2000 has been recorded.
Online sales took place three years ago, due to the use of the mobile phone to make purchases.
Experts believe that the November Black Friday could determine the resurgence of expenditure.
For over a decade, online purchases have exploded and turned commercial streets from the UK into ghost cities.
Experts say, however, that there are signs that online sales are decreasing, the latest figures indicating a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
The total amount spent in August presented the smallest growth from 2000 to today, with only a 5% increase in the last year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are falling, the latest figures indicating a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
"By analyzing the level of growth in previous years and returning until 2000, there has always been a tendency to rationalise over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told Guardian.
He explained that online sales took place three years ago, when buyers started using their mobile phone to make purchases.
Thus, it increased the number of people who could make online purchases and could do it under different circumstances, such as on the couch.
But now that it's stagnant a little, you might notice a decrease (of growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the decrease in sales.
In the opinion of specialists, buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event that takes place last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers collapsed in front of computers to put their hands on the offers, leading to the collapse of the sites for more details.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when the buyers fought the chilipyras, could determine the retrieval of the buyers.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that at least 1 £ of every 5 £ is spent online.
In the case of certain products such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are currently made through online stores.
At the same time, more than one quarter of people prefer to buy online clothes and shoes than to appeal to fashion stores in commercial areas.
After the Sanctification of the Bin Laden family, Muslims bury the killed victims after the massacre of the Macca macara
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were walked on Muslim streets, the first funerals taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia partially blamed the giant in the construction of Saudi Binladin Group for the collapse.
Health Minister said a total of 394 people were injured after the macara collapse
In the street walking ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a macarala smashed to the great mosque in Mecca.
Dressed in white, the mourners joined the road to express their condolences, until the first death reached the end of the final journey, at Al-Moassem cemetery.
The sad memory preserved by the holy place, where only a few days ago a construction mask collapsed through the mosque ceiling, falling on the believers.
The bodies were released for the funerals after the King of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the construction group of the Bin Laden family for disaster, which also fought with 394 wounded.
In the ceremony on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a macarala smashed to the great mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims were the father of the four children, Qasim Akram, of Bolton, Great Manchester, who was in his first pilgrimage when the macaraua collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Great Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual pilgrimage.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, thousands of pilgrims still reaching the city.
Today, King Salman stated that the Binladin Group should not have left the raised macara arm when the macara was not in operation.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, said the Binladin Group partly blames for the collapse.
The English news agency's service did not present that detail, but said that the company's leaders had been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman swore to reveal what caused the collapse of the macaroni in the Moschei court, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the Haj pilgrimage that took place later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made statements about the collapse of the macaroni and the Group's representatives have not been able to contact for the statements.
The Royal Decree blamed the group for not using updated security measures and did not coordinate their activities with the meteorological authorities.
Tens of the macarels surround the Great Mosque in Mecca, as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has a close relationship with the royal family of Saudi Arabia and is conducting major construction projects.
The last leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a "renegade" son, disassociated by the family in the 1990s.
Depletion occurred in strong wind and rain conditions, with just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom to participate in pilgrimage, essential journey at least once in the lives of every Muslim fit physical.
The authorities say 158 people remain in the hospital.
The authorities decided that the families of the deceased should receive a million Saudi Rials (174,000 pounds) and the same amount should be paid to those with permanent injuries.
Other wounded will receive half of this amount.
Advantages and disadvantages of converting loans into Swiss francs
On the banking market, there have already been two bids for converting loans into law in Swiss francs, the main advantages being the exclusion of currency risk and the reduction of rates.
The disadvantages can come in a few years, when the variable bond can lead to increased rates.
Transylvania Bank has just completed the process of converting loans into francs granted by Volksbank, and Bankpost has announced a conversion offer for its customers.
According to the accumulated data from the FinZoom financial portal analysts, Bankpost offers three years of fixed debt to the lei, of 1.5%, the smallest on the market.
On the other hand, the Transylvania Bank's offer of conversion was accepted by 83% of the free-of-charge customers due to the second successive reduction: the balance was reduced by the value of the risk commissions and the customer administration paid, and then an additional 22.5% reduction was applied to the Lieu balance.
Both offers reduce the rates of their customers, the girl who paid the equivalent monthly in lei before conversion.
Thus, the Transylvania Bank reduces the rate by 42.5%, and the Bank Post reduces 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, 18% in the following years.
Benefits
The main advantage of the credit coverage in the CHF is that the currency risk is eliminated, the consumer is protected from the future growth of the franc, and the repayment of the credit will be made in the currency in which the salary is paid.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that property is not re-evaluated, additional guarantees are no longer required and another proof of revenue.
In practice, there will not be a new financial and legal analysis of the credit and there will not be additional costs as in the case of a refinancing agent.
Both banks also offer a reduction to the monthly rate, the girl who paid customers before conversion, equivalent in lei.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first years is more of the bond, and the customer repays very little of the principal.
The offer of Bankpost with very small bond in the first three years seems advantageous to customers.
But it's not known how this bond will evolve after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be higher than 3.25%, so overall, and the cost reduction is lower.
A possible risk to all loans in lei with variable bending is that ROBOR indexes will grow significantly in the following years (more than Libor indexes - CHF).
For example, ROBOR at three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it reached 6%, in 2009, more than 15%, and in a few days 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, other costs, not mentioned in the original offer, may also appear.
The time has come for decisions on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world looks forward to the scheduled meeting in two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve will make a crucial decision whether to grow or not to lose interest for the first time after about a decade.
In a survey conducted by Reuters with the participation of 80 economists, a little over half that last week thought the decision would be taken, I now believe that the situation will continue for a while and that interest rates will be maintained at the current 0-0.25% interval.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought the rates to zero.
For the first time, we are faced with a situation where a major central bank could abandon the zero rate and initiate a process of normalisation of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, head analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has evolved relatively well, restoring billions of dollars in the balance sheet and generating a low level of inflation.
But the Federal Reserve should not ignore the global situation less pink.
He warned markets to prepare for an increase but there are signs that even they think such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
See who lost their charm
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has been through stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001, she struggled with leukemia and in 2009 lost her partner in a lifetime, Farrah Fawcett, in front of cancer.
It is also reported that the actor would have faced the problem of drug use and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of these certainly have a cost.
The player Luke Shaw from Manchester United is on the boat for a few months because of double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture at the right foot in the match played by Manchester United in the Champions League, ended with a defeat in front of PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the player's eyes and that will keep him on the bar for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The accident occurred following an unwarranted intervention by Héctor Moreno in 15 minutes after Shaw, 20 years old, broke the SSV defense.
He received medical attention for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before he went to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double fracture on his foot and is in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe tomorrow then he'll be operating in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, had trouble, then played fantastic and now something like that happens.
He put his oxygen mask in his dress.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but the double break break is six months and won't play in the group phase.
I hope she can play this season again.
It seems that Moreno was lucky and escaped from the red card and the concession of a punishment.
Arbitrator Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian officer was wrong.
You can judge by yourself when I say it's false and red card.
It was a very ugly intervention, with two legs.
A message on Shaw's Twitter account: "Thank you all for the messages, I have no words to express how weak I am, starting my way to recovery, I will come back stronger."
Similar news: Manchester United hit by the accident of Luke Shaw in the breakup of the PSV
The foundation of the team of England has an additional reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: "It's a very ugly accident."
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an accident.
Our players never want an opponent to get in the way.
Moreno broke his foot playing for Mexico's national against the Dutch national led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Championship.
"It's very difficult because he didn't intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it's a very serious accident, it's not good," Cocu said.
I didn't see the stage.
I couldn't see but the ball, which was heading in another direction, so it seemed that [Moreno] touched her but I couldn't see the intervention on Luke.
In the statement for SBS6, Moreno said: “I know how it is, I know how difficult it is to go through this.
I feel bad, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player, Andrés Guardado, also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth clearly risked England's omission, but he's still holding on.
The victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the team selected by England for the tournament, I don't take into account a repeat of the break with 3-0 in the test matches.
I wouldn't even remove the variant of a moving victory.
Alastair Cook's team may have less experience than three years ago, but it has good spins in the beating line and collective morals are strong; they will not be marked by the events of 2012 but will have a positive young attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at test level, is an option for attack.
Similar subjects: Adam Lyth left the team of England for testing matches and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his chief coach in Yorkshire, it's hard for me to analyze the decision not to select Adam Lyth on the team.
He played the seven test matches against two good attackers in difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are judged by results.
There were no questions related to Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and I said this before - players are their own selections.
Some 50 years and maybe Lyth would have extended his run but his destiny is in his hands.
I hope if he does more runs for Yorkshire he'll have other opportunities.
The chief coach of the team of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when performance was not as high as his ability and did not surprise me; first of all, he is a team man.
It's hard to answer the question as long as a batsman is noticed in the test matches.
Lyth had seven runs--like Sam Robson before--while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton was lucky to be home and moving.
The only disappointment you could have had was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean Tournament - when Lyth was in the highest form - but that missed occasion is the area of the past.
Alex Hales is on the team, a batsman I quote very well.
He's a cricket player who has "factor X" and we noticed him early at Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a pitch Trent Bridge.
It should be given at least the same opportunity as those before it, but this will certainly depend on the membership of the UAE team.
It was launched the idea for Moeen to open up at a fight with Cook, which would lead to extra spinner keeping at the same time four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a thrower couldn't hit there and this left-handed player has already shown himself to be fucking.
Maybe Moeen didn't bring success in his district, Worcestershire, but it was number 3 for them, so the difference is not great.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 games test 38 as first drop before entering open in 2001.
He immediately deleted three centuries and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes on the team at the back-up spinner position and, although I had a limited contact with him, struck me that he is a very impressive young man.
People could judge his fragile age - with an average of 31 to 35 to the ball - and they might think he's ready, but there's not a lot of spinners, and the voters opted for youth.
He'll learn a lot from this tour.
England has also made some changes to the coach team.
The numbering of Mahela Jayawardene, a batsman from Sri Lanka, as a test match consultant could be a master hit.
He is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, since he has played in any situation and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white-ball leg of the tournament and will bring both energy and incredulous ambition.
I always thought he was born to get involved in international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and just like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes, new voices in the dress, even if they send messages that have been transmitted before, can bring fresh air to the team.
Colly Durham's teammate, Ben Stokes is resting for one day's games, Root got a similar break against Australia and I don't have a problem with this.
Although not all are in agreement, coaches and selectionists do not do the program.
And you have to keep, players' jobs depend on the results they get.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
The Brexit camp could have a cause if the economy is kept calm by 2017
On a day that goes by, David Cameron's renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting worse, even without the choice of the genius Jeremy "Yes or no?" Corbyn at the lead of the Labour Party or TUC brings serious criticism Tuesday to Europe.
Foreigners also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained days ago that - buried in crises similar to those of the EU - not all are caused internally - some Member States are fed on the UK's agenda for concessions and amendments to treaties, which most do not want.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, TUC decided that they would not want this either if it would erode social protection.
We could even call Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The prime minister and chancellor participate in bilateral summits or sessions in foreign capitals, take a photo in front of a local famous monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wants a Great Britain with an external perspective under the EU roof - "Do not leave us alone with France," says Berlin - suggests that more ministers and officials out of certain capitals have reached the point where they don't care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the most cautious German Chancellor, is an ally who has been driving for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation collapses, as happened with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who have been too long.
In 2017, the President of France, François Hollande, will be real or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland could soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It is hard to believe that they will help the English who pose, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they do not want because the majority have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers might even plan to make deliberate remarks that do not, in the style of the SNP, help in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, suggests my friend.
"Renegotiation has been fixed" and "the Great Britain has obtained nothing of value from renegotiation".
Europeans know on their skin how overwhelming Fleet Street can be and how sceptics are the citizens of the oligarchic press who are concerned about the EU with skepticism, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our 1973 entry into the 2:1 report.
Perhaps I remember the vague by Boris Johnson, the Euro opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was corresponding to Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mix of unpaid tax bags, strangers who cheated on the phone and pseudo non-homes who hold most of the important newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair saw her kind of the same way, but she realized that when you're stuck in a box next to a nervous gorilla, you have to give her bananas to distract her from the thought of eating you at lunch and again at tea.
In fact, Miliband was more Blair than Blair in opposition to Cameron's referendum idea, given that Blair made a concession on the principle of the EU constitution abandoned, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who offered him an exit card.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched my back friends at Westminster - I told him not to spend his time with me - seems to be in danger of adopting the Murdoch Boycott strategy of Neil Kinnock in the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It may take a long time, but it must develop a coherent media cooperation strategy, not with me, but with sure Andrew Marr whose position on the BBC left her on Sunday vacation.
Corbyn's official position in front of Europe is what I'd call indulgence evolution.
It states that it would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Most of those who do not agree with the "anglicism" of conservatives might agree with that.
That's what Hilary said "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on the radio and TV this week, when his researcher struggled not to acknowledge that the appointment of John McDonnell by Corbyn as a shadow minister on financial problems was a bad idea.
He reminded me in the 1970s, when his father fought on TV to be unfaithful to his Labour colleagues, without going too far and without losing his office function.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain "in any situation" - Benn's expression - does not correspond to what McDonnell said and to what JC said to colleagues and parliamentarians in the private meeting of the night.
Regardless of the image Corbyn wants to transmit - keep it, make me aware of it - message discipline remains important in the television age and especially in the social media, a focus on paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a favour card in Europe, allowing him to take good support from the laborers in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
But McDonnell and Corbyin's basic sophistication of EU membership - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for which the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As with his sophism about NATO - Tom Watson is undeniably about the fact that JC will not campaign for resignation - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin become political capital - and there are suspected voters - for concessions to the United Kingdom when everything could be unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance of the English people in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government that cuts costs, as I was reminded of the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticise the decision of the Department of Public Health of England on electronic cigarettes
According to researchers, the claims of a government agency that electronic cigarettes are 95 percent less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people, some of them linked to tobacco industry.
Experts from the editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the publication Launched in criticising the evidence used by the Department of Public Health in England (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published the "reference" report last month and described it as a "complex analysis of the evidence".
Some researchers, however, questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to the link between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in Lancet's medical journal attacked the "extraordinary fragility base" on which PHE founded its main conclusion.
Two other researchers writing in BMJ have put their claims and their foundation "on solid ground or on moving sand" on the question.
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They claimed that it is expected that PhE’s claims that “current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95 % less harmful than smoking” are based on a detailed analysis of the evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting attended by 12 people led to the development of a multi-criteria decision-analysis model (MCDA) that summarised their views on the negative effects associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of this meeting were presented in a research work.
McKee and Capewell said that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose executive director was said to have received funding from the British American Tobacco for an independent study.
It also validated BAT's belief in public health in a sustainability report, it said.
They added that one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated the funding received from an electronic cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding reported by Philip Morris International.
No arguments were provided on the basis of which members of the panel were selected, but among them were some "frontal" known in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of which even declared the financing of the industry.
Other participants at the meeting are not known to be experts in tobacco control.
At the meeting, the head of the control section for tobacco in the PHE also participated.
The research work developed by the group "mussamizes convincingly" the lack of "solid evidence of the harmful effect that most products have on most of the criteria," said McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE claims that "to date there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking among children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of the PHE Health Department, said he responded in the past to the statements of the BMJ.
He said: "Electronic cracks are significantly less harmful than smoking"
One of the two people who smoked his whole life loses his life because of this vice.
All the evidence suggests that the risk posed by electronic cigarettes for health is less than comparable, but we need to continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public of the information it has returned and that it has not returned from the evidence, taking into account in particular the high level of public confusion regarding the relative dangers of tobacco.
Annually, about 80,000 people die from a smoke-related illness and the annual costs of the national health system for smoking reach 2 billion pounds.
Expressing clear evidence - and that is, although the use of electronic cigarettes is not at risk, they present only a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we are fulfilling our national duty.
Illegal torture equipment - delivered to the door!
Advertising that shames the British arms trade
Follow the film made by Amnesty International against the arms trade.
Terrible killer drones!
Beast to break your ankles!
Dispersion bombs!
And electric batons that cause inflammable pain without leaving a trace!
The joyful voice and animated images do not doubt that this advertising for the world's largest arms trade is an arduous charade, carried out by Amnesty International to underline the British authorities' desire to sell weapons of repressive regimes through Defense and Security Equipment International at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

However, a separate campaign also led to the display of a large number of posters at bus stations and in metros that need a second look.
"An important announcement, travelling with DLR between 15 and 18 September?" says one of the announcements, using the fonts and branding of the London metro, turning the DLR line into a tank image.
In September of this year, a lot of arms dealers will lie on DLR Customers are asked to contribute to stopping the arms trade.
The 300 posters are made by artists who exhibited works at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called Special Patrol Group has contributed to the distribution in London using "Ad Space Hack Packs", a package of 6 pounds of Allen's keys that says it "facilitates access to about a third of the public space of the world's bus stations."
The London Transport Region is not amused by this "vandalism" as a pilot.
One of the advertisements parody produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists ask more and more questions and seek to make political works accessible to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists turn to collaborating with activists in protest movements, realizing that they have to go out into the real world so that their art has an impact on society.
Another poster against the arms trade that happens to the shipowners running the subway.
The film made by Amnesty had over 100,000 Facebook views in 24 hours and was created by the advertising agency VCCP who worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and artist who doubled the voice also worked for free.
The creation director of the VCCP, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence around the advertising for the arms trade - with an empty space in the ExCel calendar - and thought, "Let's offer them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They played with a more realistic advertising, but "enriching it with strong animations and colors, it was more exciting".
"They did a great job helping us increase our interest in selling illegal torture equipment in the market," said Tom Davies, Amnesty.
Now, it would be necessary for the UK authorities to take measures to ensure that torture equipment is not illegally marketed and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative form of art on the subject of the arms trade comes from within ExCeL, where exhibitors offer fantastic eufemistic products.
In a press release, Saab released an order received from the U.S. Army on "AT4CS RS with a shoulder-supported launcher."
This includes “a single-shaped focus that provides unpleasant effects behind the armor, inside the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be nice.
Eight Golden Rules to Live in Home
It's been 11 years since I moved to my home, when I was a 19-year-old, who still believed in beer and moral relativity, but I just now remember the strong smiles of those I was angry with -- and the many complaints to others.
Most of the things I've learned can be summarized in the form of eight simple rules.
Moving to the home can bring conditions that vary from nervous fall to horror.
It's tempting to tell people where you're from, if and where you've spent a year studying, what you think of Corbyn and why "you really care about Marmite because, for good boys, it's nothing but the HAHA Drogdie extract, you find me in my room."
Breathe deep.
And help others breathe - ask questions and show interest.
They encourage the conversation and help you to differentiate the people you like from those you wouldn't talk to even if the flood came and they would be the only ones who would have boats.
Don't suffocate people.
Sleepers often have a lot of drinking parties, movie series and socializing meetings, but they are also where people dress and try their underwear.
Similar subjects: Don’t even think about starting a student’s life in a relationship
Introverts are part of special treatment at the university.
Your sleeper should be a refuge, but in many rooms a periphery culture is built through bedrooms, based on friendship, socialization and friends who spend their whole life.
All of these can be terrible for someone who's trying to charge their batteries.
None of this culture allows you to say, "I like you and I want you to stay friends, but I want you to leave to recover my energy that I consumed by interacting with you."
Try to touch when a colleague is out of socialization - and try to send a text instead of knocking on the door.
That comes to knock on the door: do it.
A guy who was sitting in the same house with me had a policy that said that if a door wasn't locked, then he was invited in.
He's seen enough things.
Make your friends cooking.
Since you're starting the university in the Bake-Off fever, if you knock on someone's door to get to know and take a black paint, it seems less strange, less like the situation in the 1950s, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've cooked something for you, now smile and I ask personal questions."
The goodness prepared in the house is a great way to make you friends.
Your tenants will feel obliged to sit down and may be able to associate your figure with a pleasant surprise.
Obviously, you have to be a smart cook.
Cocoons of flour, sugar and fat will most likely determine others to pretend that I sleep when you knock on the door.
The burden of food is a frequent offence in student homes.
Obviously, if you wipe someone's chicken is stolen, but if you take a drop of milk to put it in your tea, is it all stolen?
Ask the owner.
He'll probably tell you to serve yourself even if it boils inside.
If someone steals your things, it's annoying and I understand you - try to still address the problem more mature than my roommate, who dyed her milk with liquid detergent to punish those who stole.
He's in jail now.
Do not make noises that do not let others sleep or study.
That's not just because it makes you feel good, it's because you're going on your own.
A girl on the floor with me asked her neighbor to give her music more slowly because it was 3 in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
Their reaction was to give more music.
When they stopped the music at a final, at 5:00 a.m., the girl was kind and let them sleep two hours before going to maximum music, locked the door and went to the exam that lasted three hours.
Wouldn't it be romantic if the future husband/future wife moved on the same level?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be very strange if you confused a palier with your future husband, you got a couple, you split up and you should meet each other every day and maybe even see how all the common friends fit in?
Of course, you cannot resist the heart - but if a sexy palier colleague is certainly not your future husband, at least try to be rational.
At the moment you realize that someone left their keys in the open room, the line between light and intimidation is thinner than it looks.
A successful farce is fun, but it can damage in a few minutes.
Teach a fun and valuable safety lesson by hiding something - but never dirty someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and put the keys in a glass of water that you put into the freezer - but don't glue someone's furniture more than twice.
Violent David Grimal: There were no world tournaments in Bach's day.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, artists and not commercial representatives.
French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as soloist but also as the initiator of a less common project, of the "stranged" right, as he himself says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra made up of talented international soloists and musicians, who interprets a symphonic repertoire without having a director, and that makes it at least a curiosity in the classical music landscape.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two shows: a performance, Sunday, in which the soloist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and one month, when in the foreground was the violinist Xavier Phillips, the works composed by Enescu were unmatched.
Both performances, performed on the scene of Athens, showed the public another way to interpret classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004, being at that time the only classical musical set in which there is no director.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It is true, on the part of musicians, that they need an education either to become soloists or to become interpreters in an orchestra - speaking of instrumentalists, not composers.
They're formed as "specialized workers."
They're insinuating that they need a director.
On the other side of the scene, for the public, all the music fetishing focuses on the director.
And so, business, the music industry, it does marketing.
So we don't talk about music anymore.
So if we look at this world, we have on one side skilled workers, which is stupid, and a public who can't listen, but we have to look, which is stupid again," says David Grimal.
The violinist tells us that this change in the way music makes came from the "musical disappointments" of his soloist career.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise all over the world with different orchestras, to win a lot of money and to bring money and the music industry.
After 10 years, when I was about 30 years old, I found this very depressing, because I no longer found human creativity and fraternity in this system.
So I've found no sense of continuing on this path.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This happened in 2004, and at that time no one did anything like that without a director: "The music world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects."
"How do I imagine you marketing a collective of musicians where there is no ego?" asked the artist.
David Grimal acknowledges that Les Dissonates is "a luxury", stating that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depends on the success of this project to live.
In the 10 years of the whole, the lack of a director proved not to be a burden in the musical act: "In a curious way, as we sang a more complex repertoire, it seems simpler, because all the musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not only in the role," says Grimal, adding that at Sunday's show "I was 74 directors on the stage".
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is one "very brave", just because it also invited Les Dissonances: "An extraordinary festival, where there are the largest orchestras in the world singing 3 times a day, and in the midst of these orchestras you also invited this strange group."
In a temple of the orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is a place and interest for something different that breaks barriers.
Speaking of Enescu's work, the violinist recognizes that he feels the Roman music of the famous Roman composer, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced works by Enescu into his directory.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but this happens when we talk about George Enescu and Roman music, "for there is also a George Enescu who made French music".
Grimal is campaigning to change the way classical music education is done, considering that "the musical profession, as it is organized today, has a death issue" and that "the future of music is insatiable music".
We don't need to make the world tour five times a year if it doesn't serve at all.
There were no world tournaments in Bach's day.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, organizing concerts, festivals, tournaments, launching albums, they're all awesome, extraordinary, but as long as they're in the music service.
If not, we are in a system where creativity suffers, there is no freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave an example to Romanian products before and after joining the European Union: "In Romania, before entering the EU, you had good vegetables and meat".
In order to enter the EU, health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat had to be adopted.
Production and agriculture reach out to supermarkets, as is the case in France.
The same thing happens with music, it's the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes the roses may not be too beautiful, but when we cut them they are the real roses.
In an ideal world, this music should return to the center and that the institutions and industries managing this system should understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done by starting with educational policy.
"If we consider - as the Koreans, the Chinese, the Japanese - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things in humanity, we will reintroduce its learning in school, we will reintroduce the concerts on television and by this education we would no longer need to sell music by-products," Grimal thinks.
Surely there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, that is all over, is something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician to a soldier, or if we form a musician who will sing an instrument, being, first of all, a musician.
We're talking about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) we have to be in some way, if we want to form a musician, it's all else.
After your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?", asked the French artist smile.
Grimal shows that, for artists, the reward of another kind of making music comes from just going beyond this status as a "soldier", the overcoming of what "they think are their limits": "The musicians discover at some point that they are not soldiers, and therefore after the concert come out of the bells."
David Grimal spoke about the project or music and about his vision of music and the artist at the "Festival of Ideas", a discussion with the public organized at the International George Enescu Festival by the Aspen Romania Institute.
Profile David Grimal
After following the Conservatoire National Superioreur de Musique in Paris under the direction of Regis Pasquier, the period in which he received advice and encouragement from such renowned artists as Schlomo Mintz and Isaac Stern, David Grimal studied for a year at the Ecole des Science Politiques in Paris before meeting Philippe Hirshhorn, who changed his course of life.
David Grimal has an international career as a solo violinist, for the past 20 years which has supported concerts on the main classical world music scenes and prestigious orchestras such as Paris Orchestras, Philharmonique Orchestras of Radio France, Russian National Orchestra, Lyon Orchestra, Chamber Orchestra of Europe, Berliner Symphonicer, New Japan Philharmonic, Opera Orchestra of Lyon, Mozarteum Orchestra Salzburg, Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra and Symphony Warsaw, led by directors such as Christoph Eschenbach, Michel Plasson, Michael Schnwandt, Peter Csaba, Heinrich Schiff, Lawrence Foster, Emmanuel Krivine, Mikhail Pletnev, Rafael Frohbeck de Burgos and Peter Eotvos, and Chris Nelsons.

In addition to his solo artist career, David Grimal had to explore more personal projects.
The freedom he offered to collaborate with Les Dissonances allowed him to develop his inner universe through adventure in repertoires that are not accessible to solo artists.
Along with Les Dissonances, he founded "L'Autre Season", a series of concerts given for the benefit and together with the unaccompanied persons to the church of Saint-Leu, located in the heart of Paris.

You also have many master's courses and have been a member of the Paris International Long-Thibaud Competition in 2010.
Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres received the distinction from the French Minister of Culture in 2008.
David Grimal sang on a Stradivarius, "ex Roederer" in 1710, but also on "Don Quijote", a violin designed for him by French fighter Jacques Fustier.
David Grimal was present at the International George Enescu Festival this year with Orchestra Les Dissonances, in the program being Debussy, Enescu and Beethoven.
Les Dissonances also went on the stage on Monday, this time with cellist Xavier Phillips in the foreground, and the program was composed of Schnittke, Enescu and Brahms.
Cinema City is looking for "The Little Voice of the Great"
Cinema City launches the biggest challenge for children: dualization of two characters from the superproduction "Living 3D Zápezii"
Do you have a super-talented and spontaneous child who likes movies?
Give him a chance to get to see.
In September, as part of the newest campaigns dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, want to reach future stars and who are between 8 and 16 years of age, Cinema City is looking for "Mici Voci Mari", offering them an extraordinary opportunity to double two characters from a famous animation film.
If classical drawings focus on the actor's voice of the character's specific character, in the last period, the story creation is taken into account and those who are going to interpret the voices, and they are usually very well-known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that's why we start an unprecedented campaign.
We want to find the right voice and provoke parents to enroll their children in our competition.
They'll have a special experience, because the characters are nice and the replies are funny.
"Children will have a real chance to be part of a team of actors," said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, from September 11th to September 30th, Cinema City organises a screening to select 10 children (five girls and five boys) who will have the opportunity to give a test in a recording studio with professionals.
All you have to do is access the minilevocamari platform.cinema-city.ro, where to enroll the child in the competition and prepare it for the voice test.
Later, you have to choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is going to read and then, the child will register by interpreting his own version of the duplicate.
Four films about friendship, bassm heroes, magic and hope can choose competitors to support the test: "Pene Galbene 3D", "Mune: The 3D Moon Guard", "Blinky Bill: Koala the most famous 3D" and "Albinută Maya 3D".
In the end, the most talented two children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream come true and will double some of the characters in the superproduction "The Snow Queen - 3D Life of the 3D Nature", which will have the premiere in Romania in November of this year.
FedEx wins are mixed, due to tax forecasts for 2016
FedEx has stated disappointing results for the last quarter, the giant in the field of delivery, reducing profit estimates for the year as a result of low demand for transport services and increased costs for its terrestrial transport division.
The company also stated that it intends to employ around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
In the same period last year, FedEx announced that it would employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The company's shares decreased by about 2.5% in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the bell opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. stated that it is expected to earn between $10,40 and $10,90 for the fiscal year ending in May of the following year, with 20 cents less, according to a previous estimate.
Analysts recommended a $10.84 figure, according to a factSet survey.
The decrease is despite an increase in prices of 4.9% on average, with entry into force on 4 January and higher overtaxes for the land transport of large or large packages, which will apply in November.
The company stated that it is still expected to increase its profits over the previous year as a result of lower costs, higher revenues and the development of online trade.
President and Director General Fred Smith said that "the company is facing a significantly weaker economic situation than is expected, especially with regard to global production and trade."
The employment plans during the holiday period were announced one day after the UPS competitor stated that he intends to employ 90.000-95,000 additional workers, approximately the same number of jobs he made last year.
In the quarter that ended on August 31, FedEx won $692 million, with 6% more than the previous year.
The earnings per action were $2.42, under the average estimate of $2.44 per action made by 12 analysts who responded to the Zacks Investment Research survey.
Profit increased by 5%, up to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in Zacks' survey estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, leading to the stagnation of revenues recorded by its Express unit.
But the explosion in online purchases praised the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, the income of the Ground Division increased by 29%, but operational revenues have practically stagnated due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in revenues due to higher base rates, while revenues recorded by the Freight Division decreased due to the costs of increasing.
On the pre-market transaction, about an hour before the opening sound, FedEx shares decreased by $3.85 or 2.5%, at $150.15.
Tuesday to low closure with 11% at year level and 17% against the maximum record recorded on June 11th.
With the most anticipated meeting in recent years, policymakers in the Federal Reserve will spend two days this week around a 27-foot Mahon-Honduran table to decide whether the time has come to raise a key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Above all, at the end of the central bank's sitting room, there will be a wall painting in the United States.
The map is intended to remind you that Janet L. Yellen, President of the Fed, and his colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation above all.
The Central Bank has received a double task from Congress: maximising the employment rate in the US and maintaining price stability.
But since the great economic crisis, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be factor X in a decision too difficult to anticipate, which will be announced on Tuesday, and which will determine whether the US economy is ready to be dissipated by the unprecedented incentive offered by the short-term interest rate almost zero in force from the end of 2008.
Even if most data indicate a strong growth economy, the recent upheaval of global financial markets could frighten Fed officials already cautious about adding volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds - even with only one percentage point.
"Evidently, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main aspects to be pursued," said Lindsey M. Piezza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But if they were to seek an excuse not to increase the interest rate, the uncertainty growing on the world market is enough to provide them with arguments to expect more," she said.
There is no consensus on the decision that the Fed will take, in itself causing instability on the financial market.
About half of the economists recently questioned by Bloomberg anticipated an increase in the interest rate this week.
However, financial markets are expected to slow down by Fed, a key indicator showing that the probability of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a decline in the stock exchange if Fed increased the interest rate, except if policymakers slowed down the strike, promising that it would go a long way to the next increase.
On Tuesday, the industrial media Dow Jones raised 228.89 points, or 1.4%, up to 16.599,85.
The advance was triggered by expectations that the Fed decision factors will maintain the stable interest rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising for Fed to increase the interest rate at this time," Lonski said.
If the Fed decision factors do this, "they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in financial markets".
Other experts said that an increase in the interest rate would calm down financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about the time when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, Fed seemed to be about to increase the rate by 0.25% this month, the first step towards slowdown of monetary conditions that would confirm the US recovery force.
Yelena said in spring and early summer that she was expected to see an increase in the interest rate this year despite the objections raised by liberals as if more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, labour market growth was strong this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and almost the level considered by the Fed as total employment.
Wages have shown signs of growth.
And although inflation has continued to not reach the central bank's annual target, the Fed decision factors have said that a key reason was the temporary effect of the oil prices found in sudden decline.
The economy "can face higher rates and needs them, given the pressure on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, global financial markets began to fibrillate at the end of this month, after China devalued its currency.
The industrial average of Dow Jones fell by 16% below the maximum record reached in May, as investors feared that the slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow down global growth.
The market has decreased somewhat this month, the Dow indices now being about 10% below the maximum in May.
For Fed decision factors, market agitation is added to the complex calculation of the rate of increase.
"Without what has happened on the financial markets and news about the weakening of the Chinese economy in recent weeks, it would be more firm in the meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, an experienced researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and was officially Fed.
Now, he expects them to wait at least one month to manage the effects better.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy and almost no data to be based on subsequent events in China," Oliner said.
The well-being of the global economy is not one of the main interests of the Fed, so in practice it should not be taken into account in making decisions.
However, in reality, Fed has become a global monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been tremendous.
The President's simple allusion, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013, that Fed could "institute" monetary expansion has triggered a global earthquake.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly strained, it is to be expected that Fed officials not only monitor the progress in other areas, but also consult other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
Its decision-making process is "more art than science", said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy department of Investnet Inc.
Jeffrey Laker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that "The Fed has an oversized reaction history to changes in the financial market that seem to have nothing to do with economic bases."
Lacker, a member with the right to vote of the Federal Open Market Commission, a decision-making body that supported the increase in the interest rate, offered as an example the 1998-99 decisions.
A financial crisis affecting Asia has led the Fed to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% in three meetings, "in spite of the implications of limited identification for US development," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials came back to that decline.
The Fed should put financial stability first only in the event of a major crisis, as was the 2008 market earthquake, said Adam S. Posen, a member of the Bank of England’s interest rate fixing committee.
The last alarmed period is not rising to that level, he said.
"We certainly do not want to get into the situation of fearing an increase in the interest rate because the markets are angry," said Posen, President Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something changes in that sense, I do not think that it should take early action.

Seven's Sunrise dominates the polls, despite the attempts of the Nine channel to broadcast to Today Show about changing party leadership
The urgent move of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to convey on the subject the consequences of the changes from the leadership of the Liberal Party has not led to a significant increase in the audience for Today.
The morning broadcast of the Nina channel was broadcast from the capital after Tony Abbott's defeat in front of Malcolm Turnbull.
The competition, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was held in London as part of a series of broadcasts over the course of a few weeks, which included Dubai, New York, Niagara and Cancun.
This distance-crossing didn't seem to count too much for TV viewers Aussie TV, Sunrise with an audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today recorded a slight increase compared to the monthly hearings (317.000) and last March (283.000) but the figures were lower than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has minimized the difference towards Sunrise in the past few months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference varies between 40,000 and 50,000.
Currently, in September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that has happened throughout the morning.
This morning, Parliament is not only affected by the current change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

The main news was the stunning debut of the 800 Words series with him as the protagonist on the former Star Packed to the Rafters, Erik Thomson.
The new drama, with the subject of a widowed father soon to move along with his two children on the New Zealand coast, had an impressive average audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson was able to do a show alone, without the star of Rafters, Rebecca Gibney.
The hearing results for last night responded with a "yes".
The X-factor show transmitted by Seven was held in position, with 1,136 million viewers, easily taking over the show The Block (838.000) and TBL Families (726.000).

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss homosexual rights
In 2003, Mihail Hodorkovski, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under threat by gun at an airport in Siberia.
Because he provoked President Vladimir Putin, Hodorkovski was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was confiscated and his pro-democratic efforts were reduced.
4 people lost their lives after the police shot rubber bullets in the Nepal Protestants
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bullets in the crowd protesting against the country's proposed new constitution, an officer said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday night in Rupandehi District, about 280 km west of the capital of Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the chief of the district police, more than 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police section, and some of them threw away molotov stones and cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said police forces used tear gas after firing fires in the air before using rubber bullets.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill, are usually used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
This was the last event after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group said the new provinces established under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
Protests also existed in western Nepal, where the Tharus ethnic group wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in violent beatings launched on 10 August,
when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step towards a new constitution but an extremely controversial problem in Nepal, a centrally governed country for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution began in 2008, but legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
This week, in Kathmandu, legislators voted the clauses in the draft constitution and officials said the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We will not use wire guards, dogs, cops and guns
The Prime Minister continues the exchange of replies with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of the Government meeting on Wednesday, Ponta reiterated Romania's firm position against the refugee crisis.
We are making every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania does not agree and will not apply anti-democratic measures, watchdogs, wire guards or gunmen.
"It's a shame for 21st century Europe to apply methods in the 1930s," said Victor Ponta
"The Prime Minister said that all data and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and established at the CSAT meeting on Thursday," the Prime Minister concluded.
NHC announces 60% probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A wide, low-pressure front at about 560 km south of the southernmost point of Cape Verde is a 60% chance of turning into a tropical cycle within the next 48 hours, the US National Centre for Hurricanes said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure front at about half the distance between Cape Verde and Lesser Antilles also presents a 60% probability of forming a tropical cycle in the next two days, the meteorologist from Miami added.
Weight reduction surgery may be useful for diabetes patients with mild obesity
The benefits of weight reduction surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes could be maintained for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to say whether diabetes with mild obesity lives more after surgery of weight loss than those following non-surgical treatments.
"It takes a lot of time to centralise mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, who wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations, called bariatric surgery, use different methods to reduce the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the ability of the body to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have occurred in people with morbid obesity, with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or more.
BMI, a weight measurement unit relative to height, is considered normal in the range 18,5-24,9.
The BMI value of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and people with BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate the BMI by accessing: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at the General Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used strict data after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of barbaric surgery - gastric bypass and gastrectomy in mansions - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
The mean BMI for subjects with surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 until the end of the fifth year in the study.
In the meantime, BMI remained close to the same level, i.e. 29.
Among those who had surgery, diabetes was completely cured at 36% and partially at 28%.
In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, diabetes was completely cured at only 1% and partially at only 2% of subjects.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and "bad LDL cholesterol" "were generally better in the surgical group", the authors concluded.
Researchers have also monitored the blood haemoglobin A1c, which reflects the level of hypoglycaemia in time.
Researchers say that the optimal haemoglobin level of A1c is below 7%.
Following surgery, the mean haemoglobin of A1c decreased from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the group treated by medical methods, approximately 8% remained.
But this improved "glycemic control" - reflected by the improved levels of haemoglobin A1c - did not reduce the rate of mortality to five years, according to researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared with the gastrectomy group in mansions, the bypass surgical intervention group lost more weight (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), reported more significant reductions in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% versus 2.1%) and presented a higher probability of complete remission of diabetes (46.9% versus 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study conducted on people with high weight in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, says Blackstone, from Arizona University, Phoenix Faculty of Medicine.
In the Swedish study, obese people who had had bariatric surgery presented a probability of dying at about 29% less after 15 years, compared with a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a benefit in survival in patients with surgical intervention, Blackstone said it was an optimistic aspect for people with BMI under 35 interested in the procedure.
"This is the point where this work is critical, because it says that this surgical intervention is safe in the lower BMI group," she said, without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that their patients and doctors should start - take the patient’s BMI seriously when it reaches 27-30.
"I think we wait too long until we ask people to take this aspect seriously," she said.
I think once these genetic changes have been accumulated, which have reduced the body by predisposing it to obesity and diabetes, it is extremely difficult to return to normal.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not receive all refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current situation of the refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader sent a call to end the violence of the refugee mother countries.
Dalai Lama spoke about the current problem of the refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethical studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the United Kingdom.
He said that, in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail in the interests of each nation and even of each continent.
He also stressed that, although admirably, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
"It is great care for a few thousand refugees, but we need to think at the same time about long-term solutions to bring genuine peace and development, especially through education, in Muslim countries," he stressed.
Basically, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force has never solved these problems," he added.
Referring to the problem of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 11 September terrorist attacks, claiming that the violent response from the US generated an uncontrollable chain of events.
After the events of 11 September, I sent condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to solve this problem without calling for violence.
I know his motives were strong, but he used strength and caused unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have injected detergent in the last 4 years
According to the Anti-Pox Centre in Georgia, U.S. anti-pox centres have reported an increase of approximately 400% since 2010 in the number of children under 12 years of age who have swallowed hand detergent with a high alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Anti-Poxia Centre in Georgia, cases of hand detergent involvement in children under 12 years of age reported to anti-poxia centres rose from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"Children have more frequent access to these products and, unfortunately, one percent of them reach the emergency room," Lopez told the CNN.
Lopez said some children drink detergent and others do it to impress their friends or to respond to challenges on social networks.
YouTube can be watched movies that present teenagers as drinking detergents to create cheap drinks.
Adolescents seem to have mixed the detergent with alcohol to get a stronger drink.
The younger children may be attracted to the attractive scent of the detergent.
"A child doesn't think it hurts," says Lopez.
Many of the most attractive types (from hand detergent) are perfumed.
Hand detergents with aroma of goats, grapes, oranges are the most attractive for children.
The hand detergent contains approximately 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few ingestions can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's very concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the anti-infection center at the University Hospital in Kansas, for Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand detergents in accessible places and if the little ones get to them, this is a quick way to consume lots of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently immigrated to school the equivalent of four spraying hands detergent with hairy aroma, came to the emergency room to receive treatment.
He had alcohol 179, twice the threshold an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, a doctor in the emergency room who treated her at the Medical Centre Gwinnett outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was bluffing and couldn't walk when he got to the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital to identify signs of brain damage, as the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
He could have been fatal.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use products or services without alcohol and no longer leave the detergent at the expense of the children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with death.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand detergent containing an undeclared toxic ingredient.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth grade students in North New York agreed to poison their "bad" teacher by putting antibacterial products in class," according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand detergent and banned him in his gym.
The police considered the plan to be "unmarked" and put the disciplinary problem ahead of the school inspector.
Rumour Mill: There are no misunderstandings at Celtic
Griffiths disassembles rumors of Celtic misunderstandings, Deala admitting that Hoops are not at the best time but will return.
Hearts facing SFA on the charges of Neilson and Warburton are cautioned about the acquisitions in January that affected the unit of the team
Dons increase the difference to Celtic at five points
The punishment of Adam Rooney in the first time brought those from Aberdeen a narrow victory in front of those from Hamilton to Pittofrie, Dons getting a difference of five points between them and Celtic.
Griffiths disassembles rumors about misunderstandings
There have been rumors of misunderstandings in Celtic, disassembled by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his team should not be subjected to increased pressure because they are preparing to confront the leaders of the Dutch law.
I don't think we feel the pressure, I think the players are just waiting.
The absence of Scottishs in the race for title bores the Dutch - by Boer
The former middleman of the Rangers and former Dutch international player Ronald de Boer said Dutch football supporters lost interest in Celtic - because they did not fight for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, now ambassador of the Ajax, said: "In the Netherlands, I no longer transmit the summary of the Celtic games; why?"
Because there's no Rangers there.
Here, it's not just about the Rangers coming back.
It's about Old Firm.
It's about both other teams and there's interest.
The tension is high in the old firm games and not just the Scottishs want to see these games.
I'll change the situation, I promise you, Delilah.
RONNY Deala accepted that Celtic is fighting out of revenge, but the Norwegian chief promised to change the situation.
The defeat with Malmo and the subsequent elimination of the Champions League were followed by the defeat in front of Aberdeen who played in 10 people, now at the top of the class with a five-point advance.
But Deila said: "Celtic had periods before and will return".
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel the same way - but we have to move on.
We definitely need the support of the Celtics because so the players become better.
It's extremely important that we stay united now.
Warburton's claim for transfers from January
Despite comments just a few weeks ago that suggested that a few targets would have been identified for the January transfers, Rangers' chief Mark Warburton is careful when it comes to transfers, insisting that he does not want to affect the Ibrox team.
The former chief of Brentford said: "The period of transfers in January is very different from that in summer."
In the case of the players transferred in summer, there is a period before the season in which they can be integrated, which you could observe in this season in our group.
The team's doing very well.
Sometimes you get worse if you bring players that aren't needed.
Celtic targets Michu after withdrawal
Swansea striker Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested that he might withdraw at the end of the contract with Swans.
The 29-year-old player has struggled with the problems of the painting and has failed to leave the country of Wales in the summer.
Hearts facing SFA regarding Neilson's comments
Hearts drove with 2-1 when Paterson was removed and lost with 3-2, but the red card on the back was cancelled then - the third red card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statements, insisting: "I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance."
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastle
The invincible Hibee was taken over after he admitted to singing a song with offensive verses about the former Hearts player, Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014, in a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh before a derby with Edinburgh at Tynecastle.
"It was derby and it was the enthusiasm of the moment," said the striker, adding, "there is no need to say that I am not going back to Tynacastle unless I play for Celtic."
The Tannance Council trusts the management of Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that those in the Dundee United Board still believe that the management team will change the situation - but it is agreed that the decline on the ground must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll get the boys back in shape," said Donnellly.
McInnes is happy for "the dirty victory" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes recognizes that the Aberdeen team must be desperate for Hamilton Accies to win the seventh next victory in the league, which brought them five points in the face of Celtic due to the beating of the first coup executed by Adam Rooney.
McInnes said: “There is no team to win something, in the cup or league, and not to win such games.”
Unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged while Britain is growing
The unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged, being 164,000 in May-July, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom has increased by 10,000, reaching 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate of 5.9% in Scotland was higher than that of the UK, by 5.5%, according to the figures presented by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
In the meantime, the employment rate in Scotland has decreased by 12,000 over a period of three months, the number currently employed by 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell by 74.0% in that quarter - an average of 73.5 in the United Kingdom.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The long-term plan of authorities has laid the foundations for a stronger economy".
It's been almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen improvements in the labour market in Scotland, the employment rate increasing and the rate of unemployment falling.
Why I'm a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
During today's day, with the exception of a late legal intervention, I'll see how a man is sentenced to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in a room for observers in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary's executing room and see how Richard Glossip is running through the administration of the lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation came the first time in January, through his best friend, and, though I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day nears, I'm terrified of the idea.
So why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of the capital punishment.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists can be witnesses to executions in America and, because demands usually exceed the number of places available, there is a macabre lotteries to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for press representatives from 12 to five.
The electorate will look at the execution with impartiality.
I can't do that.
I'd be standing next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I also developed my own relationship with him over the months of phone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to have a book and a pix to note what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A reporter in Oklahoma accused me of compromising my impartiality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
He tells the prisoner's story as he wants, he gets access.
I cried to her.
He acknowledged that "it could have been better formulated", but it is still my opinion that I am wrong.
Richard Glossip didn't agree with some of the things I said and wrote.
Don't tell me what to write and I wouldn't do it if I asked.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list anytime.
But he wants to be present for an international report to write about the subject.
He thinks if he dies, publicity will help move against the capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, reporter at Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to find out more about the case, listen to the series of media files that I did.
I'm not coming back here for all the details.
I can't say for sure Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese make him guilty of complicity.
But I think it's very likely he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll watch him die from this perspective.
I can't claim to be completely objective.
For this, you can read the articles written by other reporters.
From me you'll find out what it's like to look at a man who likes dying in vain.
Peter Moody claims that the stewards tried to spy on him and threaten to withdraw from the race
Peter Moody claimed that the Stewarz Racing Victoria or tried to infiltrate a spy on his grades last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the race.
He launched an attack on the Stewarz and the Racing Victoria Department of Integrity, claiming that they are conducting a personal campaign against him, the pit that filled the glass being the removal of Lady Daddy from the race due to a treatment administered on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for the course field and that he is in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result of Leader's cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months he swallowed up his words about spy statements and did not want to sow with "the wolf that does not reach grapes".
"I wasn't going to say anything about that aspect and I kept quiet for a long time, but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that it all explodes all of a sudden," Moody said.
It's known that it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to bear the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep quietly.
I want to go with my head up and I want the owners I work with to see that you're trying to give them everything that's best.
Since they're starting to think it doesn't happen that way, I have to give up the coaching profession.
At that point, I'm gonna have to think about what I'm gonna do with my certification.
Earlier, Moody threw the bomb into a given interview for racing.com in which he said the Department of Integrity tried to spy on his grades.
"After eighteen months, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room next to a man - whose name I will tell him if I'm asked - and offered to hire him to my grades to provide information about the activity there," Moody told Racing.com.
Obviously he thinks I'm a trisser.
If so, then you should give up all because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of the RVL, David Moodie, current president of the RVL and Bernard Soundry, current CEO of the RVL, knew at that time and I know today.
Should I think it's something personal?
Is it necessary for RVL to start having a spine and can shoot people out of the coaches for what's going on in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
Is my influence on the industry so bad?
Maybe that's how I see the others.
Maybe you need to take my license and take me aside, and I don't doubt that the statements I'm making right now might decide to think about this variant.
But I got to the point where I don't care anymore, and that makes me sad.
I'm really thirsty.
I'll put pressure on and I'll decide to make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The trainee's frustration increased once with the long investigation into cobalt testing involving Leaders and the elimination decided to say that he could "put his license on the table".
Moody, whose name is most often associated with the training of the champion invincible Black Caviar, has labelled the day of the course as "residual" after applying to the legs of the horses a cotton or clay cataplasm, which violates the rules.
He violates the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he says.
One of my employees made a mistake on his feet.
Could have happened last night.
Could have happened yesterday, what happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody could have been disqualified for three months for the treatment of the day of the race consisting in the application of the cataplasm, for which the stewards opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that there is a need for rules, but it has gone too far," Moody said.
The driver who hit and fled from the crash site in Cobram was arrested
Police arrested a man after a collision with a biker produced in Cobram at the end of the week and followed by the escape from the crash site.
The biker was transported by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, badly injured after being hit Saturday morning by a car on Murray Valley highway.
Police officials say the driver of the car has not stopped to help the injured cyclist.
Monday, a 50-year-old man, surrendered to the Shepparton police.
It appears that he will be accused of fleeing from the site of the accident, of not offering first aid and other road offences.
The biker, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in a stable condition.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, responds to the opponents in the Wrestling charges.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, called the criticisms brought by his team's "denatured subjects" into discussion of the main two NRL favorites.
Coach Sydney Roosters, Trent Robinson, said the Arbitrators allowed Storm players to "take them across" the team in Storm's nervously won game at the end of the game played on Friday night in Sydney.
The coach of Brisbane Broncos, Wayne Bennett, made an easy reference to Storm after the victory of his team in the qualifying match with North Queensland Cowboys, played Saturday night, when that game was called a "demonstration" of the rugby league and said the two teams in Queensland did not get too keen on wrestling.
Bellamy jumped into the defense of his team's payroll tactics and said the players simply focused on "contact" when they liked.
Bellamy says he gained confidence after two important coaches criticized his team, which means they were worried that Storm would defeat them.
"And things don't stop here - we didn't hear Trent Robinson complaining about wrestling when they beat us with the 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that I have not changed anything all year round in our defence systems or techniques, only that in the last six weeks I have really put the emphasis on contact in investments and thus changed the situation.
Trent is in this function for three years and obviously has a great team so he's probably not used to losing and it was a shock to him.
We don't know how it always happens in this period of the year.
Bellamy objected to Bennett's idea to "simulate football", reminding his mentor St George-Illawarra Dragons of Bennett won the 2010 championship by playing "placing" football.
Wayne's talking about palpitating football.
And he argued by comparing his Saturday night game with our Friday night game and talking about how palpitant the game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St. George got a lot of criticism because he was a boring team and Wayne said he didn't care how much black under the nail.
But now he has a team that can play what we consider to be palpitating football, especially because of young rapists.
This kind of game you want to do when you have players like that.
He brought this argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his game style - not any team has two middle houses like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like this.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're kind of worried about the game with us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn't think about us when they were thinking about important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the match between Storm and Roosters was a more accommodating match compared to the match between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, haven't I seen him yet, how much was the score? 16-12?
Our game has ended 20-18, in our game there have been two more trials, that means a palpitating game?
Or is it palpitant to pause and not march?
It's plans for me.
If I'm talking about us, it means we could meet them at some point.
Storm is free this weekend because they won the right to play home either with North Queensland Cowboys, or with Cronulla Sharks, at the end of next Saturday's preliminarys, at AAMI Park, the tickets are being sold from the next March in the morning.
Steven Hogg used the girl's phone to ask the pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for pictures of abused children.
Steven Hogg took the girl's phone when she was asleep and then authenticated into an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of inappropriate images with children as a subject.
The girl woke up later and noticed the phone disappearing, which she found in Hogg's hand while he was sleeping.
He looked on the phone and found the disturbing messages that his mother immediately alerted him.
After arriving, the police saw the five photos and then analyzed the computers found at that address and found "anxious" searches on the Internet using terms to find improper images with children.
Hogg claimed he did it to " attract the pedophiles" on the Internet before "proclaiming he's a cop to scare them".
Prosecutor Eilid Robertson said to the Dundee court: “He said it is an addiction - that it is dependent on fear of people.
He admitted that he did the search on the computer but said he did it because he wanted to be a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations with the unknown person who sent the images and about the fact that he asked that person to send more pictures.
He said he did it to figure it out.
He said he doesn't think clearly when he drinks and wants to see pictures of rapes and crimes.
Robertson added: “When the girl found the messages on the phone, she called her mother and cried and cried.
The girl saw the indecent images on the phone and the defendant was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the accused used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who seemed much younger than him.
Last year, on 14 June, Hogg, at the age of 23, domiciled in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to the allegations that he had made or photographed indecent images with children, and violated the conditions of release conditional on 25 January of this year and did not appear before the court at the hearing of 24 March of the current year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be registered in the register of sexual offenders because it can be said that this offence "did not involve a significant sexual aspect".
Judge Alistair Carmichael delayed his sentence until October for reasons of social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in this file but remained in custody prior to viewing for other files.
He's been on the sex offender's record before he was sentenced.
Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, transmitted the wrong speech to Parliament
At the beginning of the year, Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
It wasn't hurt, but falling filming has become viral on socialization networks.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disturbed by opposition representatives who claimed that they would have received anonymous threats of death, threatening Mr. Mugabe not to be killed during his speech.
Last month he was killed during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The head of the parliamentary group Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on mobile phones, being warned not to disturb Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent by a hidden number but it is called "death," he told reporters after Mr. Mugabe's speech.
It warns parliamentarians that immunity applies only in Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity is no longer valid.
The leader of the parliamentary group said that the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "anxious" about the threats passed on to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will make 30,000 supplies
Hewlett-Packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 provision as part of the restructuring and cost reduction efforts in the service sector.
This year. HP will be divided on the stock exchange into two societies, separating computer and printer divisions from corporate hardware operations and services that are growing rapidly.
The proposed provisions will bring costs of approximately $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, the HP company said.
"These restructurings will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and sustainable structure with regard to costs," said Meg Whitman, president and CEO HP, who will lead the unit after the break.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more concentrated than HP now and will hold a large business portfolio that will contribute to the transition of firms to the new business-style waste," Whitman said.
Working as a separate society, we are better placed than ever to meet the growing demands of our global customers.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of over $50 billion and will "focus on providing unrivalled integrated solutions" to companies.
A company founded in 1930 by the graduates of Stanford University, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, with the purpose of producing electrical equipment and of which Palo Alto garage was called the Silicon Valley League.
HP went through a massive reorganization to adapt to the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The measure taken by HP, the second largest computer producer in the world and one of the largest US technology companies, is the most recent in the field, based on the idea that companies that concentrate their attention better in one direction have a better performance.
FriendsFest: Comedy series that taught us important lessons about friendship between men
The absence of similar characters in the series is evident, since the need for men to open is now more desperate than ever, suicide rates among young men reaching the top of the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the main cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the United Kingdom, and remained three times more frequent in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the problem, Campagn Against Life Miserably (CALM) designated 2015 as the Year of Man, wanting to put the cultural question that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
The friendship is at the heart of the struggle for the success of this challenge.
A recent study conducted in more than 2000 high school students with symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends "with a healthy disposition", his chances of recovery are doubled.
Similarly, for people who are not depressed, a circle of healthy mental friends reduces half the probability of mental disorders.
Of course, in order for the friendship to have an effect, it must first be accessible.
In this era of communication dominated by social networks, where emphasis is placed on style and not substance, the immediate nature of the response often has priorities prior to meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to distraction and success, even though isolation is actually the dominant.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - that affects and deepens our mental health.
The billionaire inventor of a video game recently explained that money doesn't even buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it focused on this idea.
The characters were not defined by the job but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The death of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, the moments when they look at football in comfortable pictures and Ross's passion for Rachel came from knowing that men can associate with this situation, even though they often dare to explore their feelings completely.
As one social worker explained to me: "My role in listening to people with suicidal and depressed tendencies has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference."
Often, people who appeal to us feel unable to talk to their friends.
The old saying to handle yourself alone is strong, as is the sense of being perceived as a weak person if you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to my mind when I try to offer more psychological adaptation mechanisms in the long term.
The series highlighted the little moments of friendship between men.
As much as it helps the objective, external intervention through the telephone, people who arrive in times of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
Thus, if you participate in this weekend's FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with the complete rendering of the filming plates to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, and better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - all 236 episodes - on the occasion #FriendsFest
Di Maria marches and helps PSG to give Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after marking against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored Tuesday in his debut game in the Champions League and helped PSG to face the Swedish team Malmo.
We continue to present you the game's chronicle and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their duty, Paris Saint-Germain starting the series of the Champions League games, with a calm victory 2-0 against Malmo in the game played on Tuesday at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of her debut game in the Champions League in the PSG team, bringing the French champions to the advantage although they missed a series of opportunities before securing their advantage with the goal marked by Cavani in minute 61.
Arriving in Group A along with Real Madrid and Šahtior Donezk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions because the goal of the French team is not only to qualify in the best but also to improve the course towards the final rounds in each of the last three tournaments.
However, although Laurent Blanc's students took the points, they were far from a perfect painting, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic who wasted the opportunity of empty after being replaced by the team from his hometown and the club that started his bright career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or in the Champions League, so victory with 2-0 creates problems for our opponents and establishes a comfortable difference between the following classes, even if there are other aspects we have to improve over the season," Blanc says.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did it, though I'm sorry we couldn't give one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after an accident to one of the three changes to the Paris team, with a 2-2 resignation from Bordeaux's home in League 1 in the weekend, but Di Maria took the light of the reflectors in four minutes.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine offensive middleman was named the man who will lead the PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he slammed Marco Verratti's foot behind Malmo's defense before moving incredibly across Johan Wiland, in the long corner on the right.
But if anyone is expected to get the victory from the fingers, they have been disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in play-off to reach this stage and entered the field with nine candidates on national teams, with a defense of five people and two defensive mediums, was a powerful opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, except by making Nikola Djurdjic's shot that passed the post of Kevin Trapp in 34 minutes.
Instead, PSG players have slowed down several times, giving some unnecessary passes and untering the interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed at least five trials only in the first time and was replaced by Cavani even after the game was resumed.
However, Ibrahimovic proved to be much more understanding in support of his colleagues, his interest being the one Di Maria sent in a shuttle over Wiland in minutes 52.
The second goal was recorded in a final after an hour of the match, due to Cavani, the Uruguayan who recorded the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic passed the center of Maxwell.
This goal has eliminated the hope of Malmo's people that they will rebalance the score and only a great stop to Wiland's remote rejection of David Luiz kept the final score before new entry Ezekiel Lavezzi cancelled a goal in the extension.
The Norwegian coach of the Malmo team, Age Hareide, later said that the PSG was with a class over and that "the last game we played in the Champions League was last December."
Since then, I've only played in the league in Sweden, which doesn't rise to the same level.
Qualifications aren't enough.
Down the hat for PSG.
They made an excellent game.
Glencore string $2.5 billion in stock sales
The Swiss miner Glencore, hit by the decline in stock prices on the commodity stock exchange, narrowed $2.5 billion in the sale of shares as part of a comprehensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore, quoted on the London Stock Exchange, said he sold new shares worth 1.6 billion pounds of sterling to buy the debt.
After having lost 57% of its market value this year, the company is on the move with the falling prices on the commodity market, because the decrease in China’s economic activity affects demand and causes disaster in the markets.
The preferential subscription right increased the price of Glencore shares on the London stock exchange in the Wednesday morning transactions.
The shares increased by 2.77% to 131.60 elingi to the FTSE 100 index, which opened to a value of 0.69% higher.
Glencore has discovered the sale of $2.5 billion as part of larger plans to cover nearly a third of the 30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at the price of 125 shillings per share, with 2.4% less than the closing price of Tuesday.
He took 1.3 billion shares out of the company, accounting for 9.99% of the group.
The concern over the increase in the Chinese economy in long-term stagnation led to a substantial increase in iron mining prices, with approximately half, and coal, copper and other goods decreased by 20-40%.
Xi calls for a wider global expansion of the economy
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with reforming that the economy should open up further to the outside world to feed growth.
"China must commit itself to attract investment and expertise abroad and improve opening policies," Xi said during the 16th Meeting of the Central Leadering Group for Deepening Overall Reform.
Promoting openness and encouraging reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and will lead to economic growth, Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list of market access regulation, relaxation of customs control policies, encouragement of state enterprises to absorb private capital and reorganise the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and areas of activity where investments are not allowed.
The system will be tested gradually and improved by testing programs.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will provide the market with a more important role in the allocation of resources, providing a legislative environment and providing a wider opening to the market.
The State authorities will also weaken control over the powers they delegate to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to manage their business.
According to the declaration, China will also allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an attempt to open state-controlled sectors, several sectors will be open to private investment.
"The State authorities will not change their foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign investment-based companies and provide them with better services," said the statement.
In addition, it will be easier for foreign citizens to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called "green books", optimising requirements and liquidating the process of filing applications.
The meeting also discussed guaranteeing the exercise of lawyers and educating judges and prosecutors.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also participated in the meeting, in accordance with a statement made after the meeting.
Education unions, unmistakable by the Government's proposal to increase wages by 10%
Negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the leaders of the Education Unions have not achieved any results, the government is proposing a 10% salary increase from 1 December to 1 January 2016, and the unions have wanted a 15% increase from November, or a 20% increase from December.
The discussions took place at the Palace of Victoria on Tuesday evening, the prime minister being accompanied by the Minister of Education, Sorin Cimpeanu, the Minister of Finance, Eugene Teodorovici and the Minister of Muncia, Rovana Plumb.
The Government's proposal today did not thank us, otherwise we would not have been able to summon the leaders of our federations.
The 10 percent that we have promised today is less for us than we expected.
"In fact, these 10 percent are the money we have stipulated in our agreement with the Government last year for 2016," said Anton Hadar, President Alma Mater, at the end of the discussion.
Bridge: In the future, health and education will be the areas where we will invest all the money we have
According to this, Thursday, there will be a FSLI meeting to be attended by representatives of the Government to present the country's confederations with a proposal for wage increases, following which trade unions will decide if they accept the Executive's offer.
The prime minister told trade unionists that the government was trying to send the Law of Remuneration as quickly as possible to Parliament, so that it could enter into force on 1 December.
The normative act provides for a 25% increase in the education system's salaries, with a 70% increase, which is foreseen in the document to be extended over the next four years.
Victor Ponta also promised trade unionists the acquisition of all sentences in 2016.
Immigrant Crisis: Tragedy in the Aegean Sea
At least 22 immigrants drowned in Turkey's territorial waters on Tuesday after the ship they were on board.
Among the victims are 11 women and 5 children, reports AFP, according to Yahoo News.
The boat was located in the Aegean Sea and headed for the Greek island of Kos.
Turkey's Coast Guard has reported that it has managed to save 249 people who were in the shipwrecked boat, but their nationality is not yet known.
Earlier, months, two other people died while trying to cross the Aegean Sea.
Also during the weekend, 34 immigrants, including 4 babies and 11 children, drowned off the Greek island of Pharmakonisi, located 15 kilometres from the Turkish coast.
The situation was similar: the boat transports more people than its capacity, so it sailed.
The route has become a popular place recently for immigrants who want to escape war and heavy life from countries such as Syria or Iraq.
Over 100 stewardesses, fired because they were too fat
The air carrier Air India is releasing approximately 130 stewars and stewards because they are overweight, the company announced at the end of last week.
The state company announced that the decision was taken for security reasons and recent government regulatory reasons, but critics say the measure is "ridical" and "socitant of sexist", writes The Washington Post.
Mass release is the most recent of a ten-year battle between the company and the most full stewardess.
Weight limit for these dates from the 1980s, when Air India began to use graphics with the ideal weight and height.
In 2006, Air India granted new stewardesses considered "exceptional overload", meaning "may have an effect on reflections and may prevent the necessary agility to carry out emergency measures".
The Stewardess gave the company to the court, won and were remanded, but they were remanded in 2009.
"All efforts to determine how weak they are have failed," a spokesman for the company then explains.
A star footballer from Gigi Becali's lesson: What decision did he make?
A star footballer gives Gigi Becali lessons about promoting young players.
If the sponsor of the championship decided to close the Academy of Football in which he invested a considerable amount, the foundation of Paul Papp opened a football school.
The Paul Papp Academy will operate in the city of Dej, deserts from the locality waiting for a first selection.
I'm extremely happy to be here at this stage, to give the start of the Football Academy that bears my name.
For me, it is extremely important to find talented children, who can play football without having material concerns at training.
They have to have one care: that's to play football as best.
Technical details don't have to be their care.
They have to value their talent.
This is what he wants to do at the Football Academy 'Paul Papp'.
"I also await Prime Minister Costan Morar at the first selection of children, to show them that he is with them," said football player Papp for the dejean.ro.
Children under the age of 11 are expected at the Academy of the Background.
The whole party wants to go to government.
PSD interim president Liviu Dragnea said Tuesday that the whole party wants to remain in government, and, if the prime minister wants, the PSD Congress will formalise this decision.
I understand that Mr. Ponta is waiting for this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants to rule, the whole party.
If he wants us to formalize by a decision of Congress, we will do this too.
There won't be any emotion about it.
"There have been no elements, voices in the party, opinions in the party that give someone insecurity to the government or give someone the impression that someone in the party does not want the PSD to remain in the government, in the current government, with the current prime minister," Dragnea said at the end of the PSD's National Standing Bureau meeting.
PSD announced when it will do Congress - what will be decided then
Prime Minister Victor Ponta said Tuesday that it is important that, at the PSD Congress, beyond the election of leadership, a clear message be given if the government wishes to continue or if the party decides to go through the opposition.
Dragnea: I'll announce Monday if I run for a function at Congress
On the other hand, Liviu Dragnea will announce next month if she runs for a leadership function at the future Congress.
I will sing on Monday, after the Executive Committee, if the date of the convention is set.
"I'll announce if I run for a party leadership function," Dragnea said at the end of the Tuesday session of the National Bureau of the PSD.
Asked if the hesitation regarding the nomination announcement is related to his file, Dragnea said he did not have this problem.
I don't have the problem to mention, but I think it's fair and honest for all my colleagues in the party to announce to me or not a nomination when the Congress date is formally established.
"It's the only motivation," Dragnea said.
The vast majority of the social-democratic subsidiaries proposed an extraordinary PSD Congress on 11 October, and the Congress's exact date will be decided by the party's Executive Committee months.

What's going on with Coach Darren Cahill?
Simona Halap is faced with a crucial decision for her career, and she needs to choose whether to continue or not to work with Coach Darren Cahill.
The two worked this year under the Adidas Player Development program, the Australian technician being beside the novel only on important tournaments.
Simona had only words of praise to Cahill, who seems to be the only coach who has managed to impose himself on the capricious sport.
The Adidas programme will end at the end of this year, and Halep must decide whether to offer a consistent contract to Cahill or whether to give up the collaboration.
We don't know exactly what's going to happen yet.
We talk and see.
"After Singapore I will be able to give an answer," Simona testified at a press conference.
Darren Cahill is one of the most expensive coaches in the current tennis season, requesting a contract of about a million dollars a year.
In addition, the Australian is also a sports commentator, a job he would not want to give up at the time of the girl.
The last meeting Simona and Cahill will work together is the Tournament of the Championships in Singapore.
It wasn't normal. I wasn't respected.
Victor Piturca devalued how Romania's national team split up in the fall of last year.
The former elector testified that he did not understand the FRF president Razvan Burleanu, after taking Mircea Sandu's place, and thus decided to leave the country.
Finally, he proposed to the head of the Federation to substantially increase his salary to remain, but he was refused.
I'm not sorry I left the country right now.
Then I felt bad, leaving a job behind.
So I thought then it was good for me and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a breeder, wasn't normal, I wasn't respected, I didn't respect my job.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came with a preconceived idea, he didn't know me, he found different opinions from the press about me.
It didn't change me because it was very difficult at the time, with the results I had, plus that it was the financial situation in the middle.
I continued my work, everything went very well and probably changed his ideas too.
But I wanted to go.
If she wanted to stay, then I proposed a bigger contract.
We have around 400 and some thousands of euros a year, so we're going to have about 600 thousand euros.
I didn't talk to Burleanu, but to his right hand.
"It was agreed, but only if we finish first in the group," Victor Piturca said at Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from Romania's national in the fall of last year, although the team had good results in the Euro 2016 preliminary.
The technician accepted the proposal to train in Saudi Arabia, he immediately took over the Al Ittihad group.

Rare disease that a man suffers from
American Nick Hess was moneyed by his family that he was drunk, his wife even filming him when he was drunk, could barely keep his feet and his words were hard to understand.
Although 35-year-old man said he didn't consume alcohol, he was clearly in a state of drunkenness.
When he first accused me of being drunk, without being drunk, I thought she was crazy.
"But friends and family thought 'maybe drinking alone, it's a secret alcoholic," she says, according to Mirror.
When he saw his wife's films with him, the man in Columbus, Ohio, simply didn't admit, "I looked in my eyes and wasn't there."
'It was terrible, I didn't remember anything.'
In addition, his wife, who, although in a while suspected of him, eventually went with him to countless doctors, reminded him of Nick's smell of alcohol.
The moment that put Nick to the test was when, after a minor accident, when he was hit by another car, he found out he had a three-time alcoholism over the legal limelight, although one night before he only consumed one beer.
After years and countless investigations, it was discovered that Nick was suffering from an extremely rare disease, Auto-brewery syndrome.
Practically, the body or makes all the carbohydrates consumed to fermented, turning into alcohol.
The one who guessed that this might be Nick's disease was actually his wife.
The disease doesn't have a cure yet, but since he gave up the carbohydrates, Nick never had such episodes again.
Destroyed a Mercedes with a golf cross
A man in South Korea destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, in protest against the services he had taken from his dealer.
The man "attached" his car with a golf cross, causing enough damage to get the car out of use, transmits BT.
The whole scene was filmed, and the video came on the Internet, to the fun of those who watched it.
The man claimed that the car has defects that endanger his life and his family.
His argument turned out when the dealer who bought the car didn't solve the problem, as agreed.
The government approved, on Wednesday, "The National Strategy on Immigration for 2015-2018" and "The Action Plan for the Year in progress", documents considered to be "a further step that Romania is going through in its efforts to modernise the immigration management process in the national territory", according to a press release.
The source indicated that the strategy aims to effectively manage the phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and action directions that reflect policies set at European level adapted to national realities.
Given the problems faced by the states in Romania's immediate vicinity, measures have been taken to manage the unity and consistency of situations identified by the possible emergence of an outflow of illegal immigrants in Romania, generated by situations of political, social, economic or military crisis.
"Roman authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time will pay particular attention to citizens from countries with potential migrationist states or who may affect national security," the source added.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that may affect immigration and asylum, including the maintenance of the conflict situation in Syria, the reactivation of the Iraq conflict, the maintenance of an unstable situation in the border areas of Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), the perpetuation and increase in the intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document sets out a number of general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, more rigorous control of the legality of third-country nationals' headquarters in Romania and the proper application of removal and restrictive measures, improving the national asylum system.
The national strategy shall also include specific objectives relevant to the transposition and implementation of the general strategic objectives.
These include: facilitating access to third-country Romania for third-country nationals who meet the labour requirements, promoting third-country nationals' access to higher education institutions in Romania for areas and professions identified as deficits.
Regarding the 2015 Action Plan, the Government appreciates that it is "a means of establishing concrete activities leading to the creation of a flexible system for stopping the migratory phenomenon in growth".

TVR management activity report, rejected in commission: Stelian Tanase risk of resignation
Parliament's cultural commissions rejected on Wednesday the report of the Council of Directors of the Romanian Television Society in 2014.
To reject the report, 17 MPs voted, one against the rejection ( Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report will be forwarded to the permanent offices.
They'll decide, probably next week.
The next plenary session will be debated.
"I believe that having this situation in mind will be done relatively quickly," said Senate Culture Commission President Georgica Severin.
He added that "it was a good feeling" that TVR leadership should also be present at this meeting, under conditions where no representative of TVR leadership was present at the meeting of the Cultural Commissions.
It was good to be here with TVR because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or anything like that.
The invitation was made to CA members yet tonight, about an hour we didn't even know an hour, but today, after the meeting of the Offices, I personally sent a fax to the TVR leadership inviting her.
I think at the time you're summoned, you've been paid a budget, paid public fees, and you're summoned to a board meeting even if you don't like live.
"Because it's your duty to serve, you're in an institution under Parliament," Severin said after the Committees meeting on Parliament's culture.
He added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed during the meeting on the basis of the negative opinion of the Committees on Budgets.
We also saw debts as they continued, came up with the idea that this year would have been a day, but they didn't pay out of history.
"I remind you that not from my fault or from someone else in these commissions has lost that agreement with banks and fiscal, there are clear management problems," Severin said.
He added that once the activity report is rejected by the joint plenary they will follow the elections for a new Board of Directors and he will elect the head of the institution.
I don't know who will be proposed for this function.
Fines won't be done.
It is important to make political decisions for this institution to function.
I'm not the man to lie to you, to tell you that there will be a genius who will stand in line here and fight.
I hope that those who decide, the plenary of Parliament, by their vote will choose with great appreciation the people who will lead the TVR.
There must be people who know what's going on there, have experience and have a lot of correctness and respect for the girl of the institution and tradition.
I don't know who it will be, if you ask me what qualities I have to feel in the attitude of the employee because he's a bastard of the little ones coming from the employees, the claimants, the dismissals.
"When you get such seizures 50, 60, 70, something is powerful and we talk about the financial situation that is a disaster," the president of the Senate Committee on Culture concluded.
Although not presented to Parliament, TVR CEO Stelian Tanase sent a letter to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Valerius Zgonea, asking that Parliament take a number of measures that could lead to the saving and guaranteeing of the economic and political independence of public television, including the numbering of the TV tax.
In a letter, Stelian Tanase requests, in addition to the indexation of the TV tax, the modification and completion of HG 978/2003 on the public service tax, in order to update the provisions at the level of technological changes per day, as well as the regulation of the control procedure in the area of the TV tax and the detection of contraventions and the application of penalties and penalties.
It also wishes to issue a provision that presupposes the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become SRTv’s agents for the collection of TV tax, by involving ANRE in regulating this activity.
In his view, it is necessary to establish a maximum ceiling of 5% of the Board of Appeal.
Stelian Tanase requires a reduction of the VAT rate for the specific activities of the public television station and the contribution to the CNC from 15% to 3%, but also an amendment of Law 41/1994, in order to obtain the budget/financing allocation for the purchase of licences for major cultural and sports events - the World Football Championship, Cerbul de Gold, Eurovision.
He argues that SRTv will be unable to pay in the following months, considering that labour law requires the employer to implement the judicial decisions, even if they are not final, and wage rights are given priority over any other obligation.
The TVR administration has made constant efforts to reduce staff costs and TV production.
"This has reduced relocations and other cost-generating activities, a number of commercial contracts have been renegotiated, and by the end of July TVR News post has been closed," said TVR President.
Tanase appreciates that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied only by his own efforts.
"Without the support of the state institutions - the Government, Parliament, the Presidency - the Roman Television will, sooner or later, be in a position to carry out its public mission further," he said in writing.
The lead of the Chamber of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Committee on Culture.

He set up a security firm Axis Corporate Security SRL, his mother's side, in April 2009, one year after he married Vasile Blaga, Agathe.
The investigation reiterated the fact that, for the purpose of the deduction from the payment of taxes and taxes to the state budget, representatives of a company specialised in the provision of security services would have created a criminal circuit, consisting of several commercial companies, which would have shown fictitious transactions.
"In fact, the company's accounting would have registered fictitious purchases of services, which, in fact, were not provided, the state budget being thus damaged by around 600,000 euros," the Roman Police explained in a press release.
The Securits have established the fate of Sanmartean
The Al-Ittihad Club's sect established the fate of the middle Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press announced Sanmartean's division of Ittihad is imminent, former printer Ladislau Boloni, Arcadie Zaporjoanu, says this will no longer happen.
Boloni is very grateful for Sanmartean.
Lucian plays game titler and does it well.
They realized that he was the best and that it would have been wrong if they had given up on him.
It would have been the option to bring another player, much better, but nothing came out.
"There have been more discussions, such as that with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing has been achieved," Zaporojanu told Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad at the beginning of this year.
Ilie Sarbu was voted Vice-President at the Court of Auditors
Parliament's plenary voted on Wednesday, the appointment of PSD Senator Ilie Sarbu, Prime Minister Victor Ponta's cousin, as Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, 290 votes were recorded for and 108 against.
The vote was secret, with ballots.
The PNL representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, Digi24 reports.
Otherwise, the Liberals criticised Sarbu's name in this function and announced that they would challenge the CCR, under conditions where he had a DNA file, but did not have the necessary preparation and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new function of the Court of Auditors does not allow her to do politics anymore.
The PSD Senator will serve as Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors, remaining free after Ioan Anton was revoked, as a result of a decision of the Constitutional Court in September 2014, which found him to be unconstitutional.
Surprise from one of the sexiest actors: I grew up in the kitchen
As Bradley Cooper was going to play the role of a chef in Burnt's movie, the actor made a devaluation that his fans didn't expect.
In a recent interview, he said he grew up in the kitchen: "I've worked most of my life as a cook."
He devalued that he had worked in the kitchen for 15 years, when he worked for a Greek restaurant, because then, in college, he continued the same way.
The actor explained that his mother had Italian origins, so the entire childhood was cooked with Italian grandmother, related to ContactMusic.
Asked what future plans he had at that time, Bradley Cooper said he was never the kind of man to make plans for five years, "not even two."
"It's no reason for me to have a map," he said.
"I dream, things you'd love to tell you," he further said, saying that what he wanted from his childhood was fulfilled.
At the age of 40, the actor acknowledged, however, that he was in the near future directing, following Clint Eastwood's model, which became king at that age.
Ponta, accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational allegations
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto condemned the statements made by Prime Minister Victor Ponta on Wednesday morning in accordance with Hungarian political decisions are "nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries where refugees flee".
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, through his irrational statements, narrowed the whole of Hungary," Hungarian Foreign Minister transmitted in a communication.
Civilised European politicians do not say such uncontrollable lies.
"His comments have one explanation: he has lost his total support in Romania's internal policy," the Hungarian diplomacy chief, according to the MTI, added.
On a Tuesday evening post on Facebook, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wanted to attract attention and sanction the behavior of senior Hungarian government officials, who, in his opinion, "are a shame to the culture and values of the European Union".
I do not want to respond to the challenges that have come from some Hungarian government representatives.
"Accession is a shame for the culture and values of the European Union; and in anti-Semitic attitudes, and with regard to the treatment of minorities of all types, and now during the refugee crisis!" said Ponta on Facebook.
The Roman Prime Minister added that it is the will of rational and sustainable solutions in the case of the refugee crisis, considering that brutality and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
The gimmata, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, politicians are determined with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which those refugees fled!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and above all European values - what we see in the last few days in Hungary is in total contradiction to these goals and values!" stressed the chief executive of the Roman.
Earlier Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto described as "simple lies" the remarks of Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta regarding the management of Hungary's refugee crisis, appreciating that these statements are inappropriate for a 21st-century leader, according to MTI.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy also mentioned Tuesday as the "extreme and false rumors" of the Prime Minister of Romania's domestic politics crisis and stated that Budapest is waiting for an apology from the Roman side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I've always said and said is that they're against Xenophob speeches the idea of closing the grenades, that all those who come are terrorists, are the fools of the Middle Ages, and I totally oppose this approach.
If we can get more, we're going to get more, the problem is our logistics ability to treat those people like some people, not the way they treat our heroic neighbors, with bat and stick.
"I don't agree with this," said the chief of the Roman executive, at a press conference in Targu-Jiu.
Every Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Government of Budapest has decided to start preparations for the expansion of the border with Romania of the guard it is building on the border with Serbia to face any changes in the route used by migrants.
Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said Hungary's decision to raise a border guard did not solve any of the refugee problems and "scattered Hungary from Europe".
What's the connection between Osama bin Laden and Macca's macara?
The Saudi authorities announced that the Saudi giant Binladin Group, belonging to the family of Osama bin Laden, is "partially responsible" for the macarala's destruction, on Friday, on the Mecca Mosque, an accident that killed 107 people.
According to a committee of inquiry, the company "did not respect the security rules", the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported, BBC reports.
The company's directors were banned from leaving the country until the investigation was completed in this case.
The signature will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction company is owned by the family of the former leader of the Al-Qaida terrorist network, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father 80 years later and is currently led by the former terrorist leader's brother, Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for 4 years on the extension of the Mari Mosque, so that it can host more pilgrims.
The accident took place on Friday night during a storm, when a macara, probably unbalanced by the strong windmills, collapsed on the eastern side of the Mari Moschei roof in Mecca.
As a result of the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How Hagi closed the mouth of the contestants
Considered by many of the world's greatest Roman footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labeled after withdrawal from the activity, as a weak coach, which cannot be able to perform in the new position.
After the unfortunate experience on the national team, Stara or Galatasaray, Hagi took over a year later the role of coach at the Constanta Future, the team that sponsors it.
After I fixed a year from taking the team, the King demonstrated that he is capable of transforming a team that was fighting for rescue from regression into one of the tops.
Thus, after a year, the Future recorded, with the Coach Hagi, 16 winners, 11 remands and 11 offenders.
The balance sheet is one of a top team, which fights against European couples.
Things took a turn and better for the Future this season, the team set in place two in League 1, with 19 points, one less than the leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (equal to Astra), more than double than Stara.
On the other hand, even if he brought more experienced players to the team, Hagi continued to promote young people, and in the last period in the team started names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea.
The club's policy made from the Future a team of followers for foreign teams, so Hagi sold 1.5 million euros this summer - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
Next to Staraua, The Future is the only profitable team in League 1, according to data from the Trade Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has so far played as a small country.
It is a legitimate strategy, but after that you cannot ask to be treated as the EU's seventh country.
The big tariffs come with solutions for the EU as a whole, says Christian Ghinea, a member of the college director of the European Centre for European Policy.
In an interview given by Ziare.com, Christian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and the pure police will not function in this crisis: "We may have doubts about the quality of the values that these people come with."
But there are masses that have started and we can't go back to history.
Migration is a reality to which we need to adapt as best we can and adapt to them.
In the opinion of Christian Ghinea, we are at an extremely emotional moment, when politicians feel they need to show their muscles.
Once it passes, Europeans will not be willing to give up free circulation, but the rules in the Schengen area need to be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created at a different time and has not been adapted for the situation from now on."
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JAI council that actually didn't solve anything?
It is clear that the EC Presidents, in agreement with Donald Tusk, did not want to force a vote in the Council.
All the predictions said he had the necessary votes.
Before the Treaty of Lisbon, the JAI shall apply the principle of unanimity and any state may block any decision.
That is why things were very little integrated in the area of justice and home affairs.
According to Lisbon, the normal procedure, in which the EC has the initiative, and the Council approves it with the vote of 55% of the states, i.e. 16, representing 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said the votes existed.
But they didn't want to go ahead.
Because it is a sensitive issue, rejection reactions have occurred in Germany against Chancellor Merkel's opening policy and did not want in many countries to appear to be a "EU sending us migrants on the run".
They have soared, but the problem remains because, obviously, this valley creates a huge problem for the Schengen governor and we will probably be seeing major changes there in the next period.
So the mandatory rates weren't really removed, but the subject was just allowed to grow?
Yes, on the other hand, it is talking about a greater involvement of Frontex in the management of external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of the members on the Schengen external border to the responsibility of the Community agencies.
Greece's granite with Turkey is also Germany's granite with Turkey, in fact, and this wave of migrants has set the limits of the old Schengen system.
Perhaps he will give up the Dublin principle, according to which migrants are the responsibility of the state in which the first hour comes, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece is capitulating, you can't tell infinity that it's Greece's business.
Problem and common.
Just because the problem is common, is it possible to solve without a specific mechanism, perhaps even mandatory, to make the receiving effort?
No one knows exactly how mandatory quotas will work if they reach them.
Because there's a problem: what are you doing with a man who doesn't want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don't think European states are going to pick up migrants: you're going to X or Y.
It is likely that it will reach some single filter centers, in Greece or Turkey, where asylum applications will be processed.
They're working on solutions like this.
But the problem doesn't have a simple solution.
There are countries that have ten years of experience in trying to integrate migrants, there are countries without any experience, such as Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase the current xenophob.
Of course, we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, who are in pre-war camps and who have just begun to go to Europe.
One estimate says that only 10% have managed to leave, winter is hard past the Mediterranean, but we were expecting next year at a wave maybe even bigger.
What are we doing with these people?
My prediction is that we're going to get used to this problem, we're not going to look at it as a media disaster anymore.
Talk about countries with smaller or larger experience.
Do you think there is any place where it has truly succeeded in integrating large groups from an extra-European culture?
I look at the Maghrebs in France, the Turks in Germany, they're still enclaved.
I wouldn't go to radical statements.
Of course, their integration is more difficult than in other migration waves, but that does not mean that it does not integrate at all.
An unintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, Germany, the United Kingdom.
But the pure police will not work.
To create Europe's strength is illusion.
It must be followed by integration mechanisms in European societies.
There were some mistakes here.
We need to be more assertive.
To ask these people to learn the language, to try to take the values, not to stay with one foot in Europe and one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of the family, including through the couples of convenience.
However, the future problem of these people's long-term integration problems must be separated.
If others have failed to integrate in the long term, it doesn't mean we have to look at them as they sink into the Mediterranean.
Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come with.
And if there's an intervention in Syria, what I don't think, doesn't mean it's going to get back over the night and you can take them back.
Until solutions appear, we see strengths in Europe.
Borders are closed, walls are raised, border controls are reintroduced into the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project like this no, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimally and by arranging the rules so that the pressure was too high on the lands where I put my foot for the first time these migrants.
I mean, we're walking around free of charge, but everyone's in trouble.
In the face of such a wave, it can't be that way, because some countries don't make a girl.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to look like they're doing something, but in the long run, it doesn't change much.
After the attacks in France, we do not have much more draconian anti-terrorist legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It's a wave of public emotion that is installed in both ways.
And it's so unstable from one week to the next that you can't make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of friendship, a lot of military statements from politicians at home under pressure to be men.
And then, you have a dramatic case of the child being killed in Turkey and the public opinion is excited.
After the public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people but also for goods.
This is the only real European plate.
And I don't think Europeans will abandon this principle of freedom of movement.
That there will be other rules is something else.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era that was not adapted for the situation from now on.
How did Romania play in this crisis so far?
Like a small country, which thinks, if she pulls the bag on her eyes and spreads her ears, the theme disappears.
In the face of the reality of migratory waves, you can choose to be part of the solution or say it's not your little country problem.
We have done this, it is a legitimate strategy, but then you cannot ask to be treated as the EU's seventh country.
You're not, you're not playing big-country.
The big tariffs come with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we are not now discussing their quality.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the Roman appetite for Schengen will decline very much.
President Johnnis says it may be good that we haven't already entered.
So we move from the despair of entering to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
Of course, there is a risk that Romania and Bulgaria will enter Schengen to see us as an alternative route.
Which doesn't mean there's a reason not to enter Schengen anymore, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed in the sense that external borders will become common responsibility, will be the only rules for accepting migrants, the only rules for deportation for those who do not receive asylum, the only rules for safe tariffs.
The Ukrainian president said after Russia moved attention to Syria in Ukraine no one died.
Is there a connection between the two seals, a Russian game?
Russia has a frustrated power behavior.
She believes that being strong means inducing Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a link.
Without the military and financial effort of the Putin regime, the Assad regime would probably have collapsed long ago.
And it was good to pass before the main or the opponent to be the Islamic State.
For about two years there was a struggle between the Assad regime and the secular and moderate Muslim armies, supported by the Gulf and Western lands.
Then the Islamic state rose and now we don't know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia could complicate things, but it can't participate in the solution.
It creates a seal of instability and chaos that cannot be closed.
But you're very powerful only if you have solutions.
The game off-side is just a strategy to win time.
Maybe Putin's waiting to make offers, press him on the buttons to solve the situation.
Offerings do not come because the world is not convinced that it can solve in one way or another all the things created by it.
But I don't agree with the theories that these people are being manipulated by an invisible hand.
Let's not see a little bit stronger than it is.
What button will appear soon
Millions of Facebook users are used to the "Like" button, and now the socialization network representatives are preparing another opposite, the "Dislike" button.
Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and executive director of the company, announced on the account or that this button will soon be available, reports New York Times on the blog.
Zuckerberg stated that the "Dislike" button will look better than a nineth of what a user feels than a simple option.
However, the announcement or raised the problem that Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wanted to avoid the moments when someone posted on the account or an important event in life, and someone else would give "Dislike".
Network users, who have reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long asked to be able to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg also said it is not very comfortable for people to give "Like" current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the case of a death of a family member.
"You may not feel comfortable giving Like that post," said the Facebook representative.
The variant of a new Facebook button was not well received by everyone.
"There is already enough hate on Facebook and socialisation networks," said Atiq Haneef from Afghanistan, on the New York Times Facebook page, where he posted an article on this subject.
"I'll give 'Dislike' the 'Dislike' button," he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist from Atlanta, has argued that there is nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, a social analyst at eMarketer, mentioned that it is hard to imagine that a single button can transmit a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she supports the campaign in America, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary accepted only 70 migrants on Tuesday, a handful of thousands of arrivals in mass at its southern border with Serbia, government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi announced.
Hungary has declared state of emergency during the day in two Thursdays along the border with Serbia due to the refugee flow, closing a main point of crossing the border and announcing that it will build a fence at its border with Romania, the DPA recalls.
The measure has attracted a sudden reaction from Serbia.
Even yesterday they said they'd seal the border for those who want to pass, but not for those who want to have a seat.
"As you can see, this is completely different," said Serbian Refugee Minister Aleksandar Vulin.
Before the new immigration legislation was imposed, a record number of 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, the police announced on Monday.
More than 170,000 Middle East and Africa immigrants also served in Hungary, Serbia, in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and try to reach the West, especially in Germany.
The "New" headquarters of the Jewish Council is standing by.
Two builders, insolvent
The massive investments that have been made here in recent years for the purpose of the institution's move are expected to fail because they have been stopped several times.
Two important builders who worked here entered insolvency during the work.
The headquarters of the Jewish Council in Vasile Aleksandri Street will be able to break down on its own.
In one and a half years since the construction consolidation and refurbishment work had to be completed, the work had not reached half.
A final stage of the building's epoch was consumed last day, when the National Dispute Resolution Council (NCSC) rejected a complaint from the firm that wanted to take the contract to carry out the technical project for the remaining work to be carried out.
The initial project was initiated by Impex Romcatel SA.
Following the insolvency of the manufacturer and the termination of the works, negotiations were started without the publication of a notice of participation with Impex Romcatel, the company intended to update the technical project, and then a new tender for works was organised.
"The negotiations did not end, however, through a contract, the CJ appreciating that the proposed form would have benefited the institution," said Rázvan Timofciuc, representing public relations within the CJ.
The CJ decision to terminate direct negotiations was attacked in court by Impex Romcatel.
The Court of First Instance referred the complaint to the CNSC, which rejected it, as a matter of urgency.
This does not mean, however, that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to attack the CNSC decision at the Court of Appeal, only after a final sentence of it can be taken into account when finding another designer.
Thus, the building consolidation work could be resumed early next year.
Our intention is to resume the work as soon as possible.
In principle, the restoration of the technical project should not take long, but we must reach the conclusion of a contract.
"We are waiting to see whether or not the CNSC decision will be attacked," Timofciuc said.
The consolidation of the former Police Office began in 2011.
A first contract of work was concluded in April 2012, after works of 4.5 million lei were carried out.
The tender was renewed, the contract being awarded by Moldovaconstruct SA.
However, the firm entered into insolvency, and this contract was settled after payment of 1.5 million lei.
The work has been done so far in proportion to approximately 50%.
Originally, the work of consolidation, re-reconciling and mansaging the building was evaluated at 7.7 million lei.
"Stop, I say it all!" - a statement that could incriminate the former head of the Department
One of the employees involved in the scandalous file from the Office of the Treasury has signed an agreement to recognise the facts, against imprisonment with delay.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the other accused, in front of the former chief, Narciza Nedelcu
A councillor from the Office of the Cadastral and Real Estate Advertising (OCPI) accused of DNA in a corruption file admitted his telefon.
The agreement on the recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru Dascalu was registered yesterday at the Iaşi Court, the judges deciding to give a solution in this case on 29 September.
Dumitru Daniel Dascalu was accused of continuing intellectual fraud and agreed to execute two years in prison with delay, as well as work on behalf of the community.
With regard to the actions brought by Dascalu, prosecutors have stated that he, as a councillor of the Office of the Cadastral, together with other colleagues, " has entered into a number of verbal processes of acceptance, with the acquisition of service service contracts in previous keys by O.C.P.I. Ia and the administrators of SC Gauss SRL, SC Group Five SRL, SC Topo Euro Cad SRL, SC Castra and Topography SRL and PFA Lipsa Stefan, who in fact testified that the services contracted were carried out in full, under conditions where they were not carried out and were not deposited at O.C.P.I. Iaşi".
In the past days, the former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, but also other former or current employees of the OCPI were sent to trial in this file, the charges were deposed of services to the companies mentioned, although the works were not carried out.
Before the trial, it's over 300,000 lei.
Adventures in Stone Age
In the opinion of FRH President Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and the preparation of the national women's handball to qualify for the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
The president of the Romanian Handbal Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said, yesterday, in a press meeting, that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the League of Champions.
With regard to Romania's national women's handball team, "the main goal is to qualify for the Rio Olympics, but for this it has to pass two stages of the hot tubing, first the World Championship and second the pre-qualification tournament," Dedu said.
We really want to qualify for the Olympics.
There are some fantastic requirements on the part of the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
The staff that will be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants second coach, doctor, two masori, porter coach, physical trainer, head of delegation.
They asked us to get some things, more precisely material for physical preparation, which we've never heard of.
All this to get to the Olympics. And I'll do whatever it takes to have them.
We're talking about a massive investment, there's a lot, a lot of money.
But this is the way to perform.
Because at the moment we're in the stone age with the preparation.
"The teams we fight with have these materials and have them for a while," said Dedu, who mentioned that he was trying to get the amounts needed to buy these products from MTS and COSR.
The President of the FRH also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility of our country hosting a major handball competition.
We don't have a room in Bucharest.
It is an infrastructure problem and it is embarrassing to be asked about a European Gymnastics Championship.
Let's not forget that in other parts of the world Olympic districts have been built entirely within two years.
Before 1992, in the current Barcelona Olympic area, there was a pile of garbage, and now there was a beauty trail.
The same happened in London, where the 2012 Olympics were a success and investment in terms of investment.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition," Dedu said.
He added that international handball organisations are willing to grant Romania the organisation of a major competition.
For me, it is a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Gatzu went civilized with a project, people agreed in principle, but they soon realized that the hall will never be built.
I also had discussions with the EHF, I told them that we want, that we are able to organize and they said that I agree and invite them to the first match in the new room in Bucharest and then discuss concretely.
"So we have the whole opening, both in the EHF and in the IHF, but we don't have infrastructure," said official FRH.
The former great handballist avoided evaluating the chances of women's teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach Final Four: "I have asked all coaches to be reserved in predictions, that if they don't meet back against them".
Good way to the World Cup
Romanian Rugbys begin on September 23rd, against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said, on Tuesday, in a press conference, that all members of the Romanian lot are prepared for the World Cup matches in England, where he hopes to win two victories: "We are ready".
Both I and my colleagues are with the engines at maximum speed.
We've trained to give the best performance in the four matches.
Everyone will have great expectations, because our goal is to win in two matches against Canada and Italy.
All groups are heavy and ours is the same.
Let's take it easy, first with France and then we'll see.
But if we win with Canada, the game with Italy will definitely be our final.
I can't describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, it's the announcement of so many years of work.
I wish I didn't disappoint anyone in the rugby family and come home with nice results.
"We want you to be proud that some players, a small family like rugby in Romania, are proud of the tricolor," Macovei said.
Romania's national team selector Lynn Howells, who is in the first experience as a World Cup coach, hopes to make Romanians proud of the rugby selection: "It is a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup".
I'm sure the players are ready to take part in the tournament.
It's an extraordinary experience for me.
It's very important to me that every game I make Romanians proud of the national team.
The president of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitras, believes that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in the past few years in rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made on the national team.
I wish the athletes success and I am convinced that we will be at the forefront of the event.
"These guys started playing in Romania's teams at 18-19 years of age, so there's cohesion, it's a band of friends, who's set up a dream," Dumitrasch said.
At the World Rugby Cup in England, Romania will evolve into Group D with the following events: with France on 23 September in London; with Ireland on 27 September in London; with Canada on 6 October in Leicester; with Italy on 11 October in Exeter.
The competition starts on Friday, at the Twickenham Stadium in London, with the England - Fiji game in Group A.

14 million lei given to the hospital "St. Spiriton" in Iaşi at budget correction
What will be purchased with this important amount of money?
The hospital "St. Spiridon" received about 14 million lei from the Ministry of Health following the budget correction.
The money received by the medical unit to use it by the end of the year will be invested in the modernisation and management of clinics, but also in medical equipment and technology for which the hospital has already begun the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the health unit will be equipped with a new tomographic computer, with a new radiology device, with six screws used for surgical interventions, six ATI beds equipped with appropriate ophthalmographic microscopes and other devices necessary for the implementation of the medical act.
On the other hand, 5 million lei from the money received from the hospital will be directed towards the construction and management of the "Great Ars".
From the budget correction money, UPU will receive 500,000 lei to finalise the modernisation works in the main throne.
"In addition, the following days we will receive the works from the gateway linking UPU to cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology clinics to ensure transportation under decent conditions of the UPU patient in neighbouring clinics," the medical unit manager explained.
The hospital will soon have in court and the Dermatology Clinic in the State, which will organise it in the outpatient hospital, in the same form as it currently works.
The clinic will operate in the area where it is allergology, haematology and endocrinology from the outpatient clinic and will have approximately 30 beds.

Fishing of a tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iaşi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After my experience, neither my wife nor I ever want to walk in your city again.
Without wishing, they hit the wrong information out of the envelopes, the lack of feeling of RAPT controllers and, bonus, an amendment "as the law says".
The husbands arrived in Iaşi a few days ago, settled in a hotel in the center and asked for tourist tours.
They also received a envelope in which the RATP routes were passed.
"Armed" with these maps, the husbands visited the dock.
But, two days ago, you were in Copou, they wanted to get to Palas Mall.
Since she wasn't tuned with tickets at the station next to the Copou Park, they were based on the information typed on the envelope: that I can get a ticket via SMS.
No one told them that this service no longer exists.
Reliable in the envelope, they got on a bus and tried to send a text message according to the envelope instructions.
Unfortunately for them, he made a team of RATP controllers appear.
They said there was no service for 2 years and that it was announced in the press that it was cancelled.
How do I know what was written in the local press, I'm coming one night before I visit the city?
I talked to the controllers, I explained the situation, they said they don't care, that's not their job.
The attitude was very challenging.
They said that all I can do is give us one amendment instead of two (May and the wife).
"I paid, I didn't want to ruin my day of visiting the gendarmerie and giving the statements there!" Ovidiu relates.
In conclusion, the family was amended because of misinformation on the envelope and the controllers who "applyed the law to blood".
It's not right, and I've made a sit-in at RATP Iasi to get my money back.
It's not about money, I'm not too much, but the idea is I felt wrong.
Ghinion for Vaslui rapists.
They had an accident and remained in preventive custody
The trial of the seven rapists from Vaslui moved, yesterday, to the Court of Appeal Iaşi.
The judges of the court tried the first term of trial at a non-public meeting where the seven young people accused of beating an 18-year-old asked him to be released.
Before the trial session began on its own day, one of the judges who had been assigned the file, Viorel Monteanu, made a request for abstention, which was admitted by his colleagues from the court.
The magistrate activated until this summer at the Vaslui Court, where he was the president of the Section on Nale, who, on 9 April, admitted a complaint made by four of the defendants, having them placed in custody.
Currently, the file is judged by a complete one of which is part of the Magistrates Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Earlier, in the file, Judge Dan Anton also made an abstention, because his daughter was in a relationship of co-conjugation with one of the offenders' lawyers.
The two judges decided that Vaslui's rapists continue to remain in preventive custody.
Your blacks will remain in prison for at least 30 more days, when the Jews will regain their freedom.
Following the term of judgment, it will take place at the Court of Appeal on 6 October.
Before reaching the Court of Appeal Iaşi, the van with which the Violators were transported from Vaslui was involved in an accident produced in the Păcurari district, the car entering Iaşi on the center.
The Iveco car driver with whom the seven rapists were transported hit a Volks wagon car that came out of Canta Street, and the driver tried to turn left.
Duba circle from the end of Easter.
The car entered Iaşi here because the employees of the Penitentiary Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to Iaşi to Graduri, then the seat belt.
They so shorted the road a few miles away.
Immediately after the impact, the arrest escort called for another transport to take over.
Shortly after the accident, a car was sent from the Supreme Security Prisoner Iaşi, who took the seven detainees and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
As a result of the accident, none of the arrests were injured.
To transfer them to the other van, the guards surrounded the back of the nipples, and the arrests came out fast, two or two.
"The incident has not been reported to the police, because drivers of two cars have been friendly about the damage to be paid," said Commissioner Mádălin Tăranu, within the IPJ.
Large migration
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what is to come.
What about Europe?
I say this from the outset, clearly and reputedly: neither the 7,000 refugees that should and should naturalise Romania is, in itself, a small but huge number compared to the capacity of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, in the amount of about 1500 souls, is far more than the good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in the past few months.
Of course, if those migrants will even agree to settle in our localities, their chances of quickly integrating them into Romanian society are extremely small.
I'm sure they'll be the first to lose their patience.
Paralysed and paralyzed by a venous political class, the Romanian state is impotent in all areas.
The inability to integrate the gypsies is just a banal example.
In addition, governments of any color have not been able to absorb European funds, make roads, gardens or modern schools, provide decent medical care, make a living on the street, create decent paid jobs or keep their own young generation at home.
Why would refugees be established in another country from which they flee?
But what makes a lot of wonder is the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is treated.
We are first hit by the warlike ferocity of the EU's powerful states, which give us the highest degree of generosity when it comes to sharing the troubles with the smaller countries.
Then comes the fearful hypocrisy of Romanians who, although they have millions of reds scattered all over the world, still do not accept it in another language, another religion, another blood.
He's probably afraid he's not stealing from any national being.
Finally, there is a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although only invoke war horrors as a reason for their departure, do not accept the exodus destination other than Germany or the Nordic countries.
But not all refugees are Syrians, and there is no war in Pakistan.
Also, the simple way in which the crisis is analysed can only be taken seriously.
Causes must be eliminated, supported by some and, by placing strict emphasis on the book of political correctness, demand for peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
But in Romania there is peace and even more, from time to time, something foreign capital in the national economy - but this does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why is she leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself to us as an ankylosed, confused and overcrowded building.
I regretted that Romania is not capable of inventing a country project, but that neither does the EU have any future plan.
And improvisations and threats don't help at all.
Then, what else does the EU use if the only advantage that Romanians enjoyed - the right to free movement - could be discussed because of the waves of refugees crossing the border as cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will end.
Not even the migrants' crisis.
Over the next few decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource exhaustion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants from Asia and in particular from Africa to a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is neither and will never be prepared for what is to come.
7,000 euros a year to rent the Pogor Club.
Destination, practical, imposed
The concessional tender shall be for a period of 10 years.

Two brothers from Tomeşti swallowed sleep.
They were taken to the hospital
Two 9-year-olds, 11-year-olds from Tomeşti, brothers, swallowed more Diazepam pills.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother followed a treatment, and the medications were not hidden.
The children were taken urgently to the hospital "Saint Mary" in Iaşi.
They're stable, as doctors say.
EXCLUSIV: A meeting that breaks your heart.
At the age of 20, she received a brave gift: biological parents
Lost in a hospital in a state of neutral conditions, in the early 1990s, when he had only two months of life, small, sick and helpless, and then adopted by an established family in Italy, in the same years when adoption was vaguely regulated, a young woman, now a blonde and beautiful girl, reunited in Iaşi with biological parents from a village of the Jew, after almost two decades in which no one knew anything about the others.
Crina will fulfill these 20 years, and her adoptive parents in Palermo thought to offer their beloved daughter a bold and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, Iaşi, to get to know her dark past.
The day of Iaşi, who attended the efforts of the family of origin after a few extremely vague indications, was witness to these meetings that practically break your heart.
Reporting to reporters, moments emotions, statements of those involved, their reactions are of moving and compulsive law.
The story of China begins 20 years ago in the exit village of Ruginosa, when it was only two months old.
Then, due to a health problem, the girl had to be hospitalized in the city.
Home they began to have misunderstandings between parents, and Mother was forced to leave home.
He decided to keep the girl and send me home.
She stopped the girl, and since then I've known nothing.
"When I found out that she was in the hospital, it was too late," recalled Alina, the girl's biological mother.
Crina was hospitalized with her grandmother at the municipal hospital in Pascani, and still then the daughter's father, Costa Rican, went to work in the city of Alexandria, Judge Teleorman.
Their lives were to be cut off permanently.
They didn't find Crina at the hospital anymore.
After boarding, the father of China went to work in another location, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iaşi, and the father, when he came back, no longer found her.
I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"I should have thought she was abandoned," she told a niece of the family.
Because of financial problems, Grandma was unable to come with Crina to Iaşi, and the girl remained in the care of the doctors.
Because no one was interested in the fate of the child all this time, it was taken over by the Directorate-General for Social Assistance and the Protection of the Iaşi Child, who then took care of the Bucium Investment Centre.
It was years when abandonment and adoption were more regulated than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center was found by the Italian Salvadoran and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted their child but did not succeed.
They fell in love with the Crina blond, and after a while it would definitely move with them to Italy.
The small has already been done for nearly two years, while the adoption formalities have lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt she was our girl.
"As if my wife had given her life," says Salvadore, the adoptive father, smiling at us, while he catches the girl's hand in the palm.
In the country, the parents of China, Alina and Costa Rica, continued their search separately, wherever they could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginosa, but he didn't get any answers where his child might be.
The police then reported that it is possible to die, but Iaşi's parents found out what really happened to their girl.
When I looked for her here, they told me to go to the Court in Italy, to Palermo.
And the conditions for me to look for her were gone.
We prayed to God to be good.
I've been thinking about her all the years that have passed, but there's been no way to walk, find her.
"It's hard," she tells us with tears in the eyes of the biological mother of China.
But even though the years have passed, Ruginosa's parents have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and her wife explained to the girls where she came from and that her past was a link from Romania.
I was small when I found out.
I think I was five or six years old.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to meet my parents from Romania," confesses Crina.
And her dream was about to come true.
In March of this year, Commissioner Ichim, the director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Anti-Drug Counsellor, was contacted by a knowledge from Italy, who explained Salvadore's desire to find the biological family of Crete.
And the search only started with a name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.
We only got a name, the Costa Rican Balkans, then the locality, Ruginosa.
In a short time I had an activity with the primacy from there, and I could ask if there was through the locality the name received.
Then they gave me a few clues, just that the person found wasn't the one that was looking for.
"It took about a month for us to find the girl's biological father," Roman Commissioner Ichim explains.
In total, over three months they took the authorities to find Costa Rica and Alina, especially that each had its own home in another location.
We started taking steps somewhere in March, and in June-July we completed the identification of biological parents and discussions.
"Then we decided that a first meeting would take place in September," said Romica Ichim.
Last weekend, Alina and Costa Rica saw for the first time the girl who was lost at the hospital in Iaşi, 20 years ago.
Father, excited, could hardly master his tears, and his hands were constantly shaking.
He can barely change a few words with those around him.
A week before the meeting, she couldn't even sleep.
He was all excited, scared.
"To see your child after so many years, it's something," says a niece, who came with Costa de la Ruginosa.
Meeting with the mother and the biological brother
In his discussions with his daughter, who is going to study at a well-listed university in Italy, Costa Rican said, among other things, that if she ever wants to come back to him, in the village, come quietly: she can give him something sheep, goats, to find a boy in the village and bury a household.
Mom is also excited, crying, and she finds it hard to believe that such a thing can happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I didn't think that could happen.
I've seen such cases on TV, I've been thinking these years, I've been hoping, but I didn't think I could be like that.
They're very big emotions.
If he could forgive me.
I hope we visit in the future.
"I hope we can keep a link," she tells us with great tears on Alina, the mother of Crine, while holding a service in her hand.
In it he hides his tears, happily, because in a short time he'll see her face after so long.
On the other hand, Crina, who will meet in just a few days, this month, 20 years, is trying to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn't know what to expect, but she has a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they're young, but now before he meets, he's trying to collect his thoughts, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to complain about.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are finally the ones who raised me.
It'll be a beautiful meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope I have a nice memory with them, because there are so many things to say now," Crina confesses.
First family meeting in Iaşi
In the Union market, under the early autumn sky, the family in Ruginosa reunites its destiny with their daughter in Palermo.
Crina is 20 years ago, finishing high school, after the Italian school model, but can start a new chapter with Alina and Costa Rica, her biological parents.
They no longer divide borders or countries, but only one barrier: the language.
Over which, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in the center of Iaş, they passed easily.
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first event of this kind, and that in the future, if the opportunity comes again, they will.
It's the first event in this way organized, such an emotional charge, and I'm glad it's a success.
We, at the Centre, have various activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution that only deals with consumers, drug-dependent people.
But we're trying to restore society to something good back.
"If I have been asked for such an event, I will do it with great pleasure," says Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Center for Prevention, Evaluation and Anti-Drug Counsellor.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, is getting away with history.
I understand: they have a lot to tell each other.
Armistice with weapons at the foot, yesterday, at the PSD.
Everyone-sucks their soul
The pillars of the PSD's exit branch have completed an armistice at the foot.
After successive rounds of discussions, held Friday to Sunday, the first and most tense, the PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend the hostilities.
Pressed by the party's executive president, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, outgoing social democrats will send him a full list of potential candidates for the party's functions.
Apart from being finished, the party's internal war seems to have only taken a break to allow fighters to shoot their souls.
Dragnea didn't give an ultimatum.
He has launched a very simple and very current message in the conditions now: try to find a solution not to put the party in danger.
On October 3rd, we have a party election.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," said interim mayor Mihai Chirica.
The two days of the weekend discussions led only to the conclusion that nothing was certain.
In the elections in October, excessive competition is expected for the office of President of the Jewish branch of the PSD.
On the short list of potential candidates for the main function of the party's exit branch is the Secretary of State, Senator Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazár, Jewish Counsellor Vasile Câtea and interim President of the Judezian Council, Victorel Lupu.
These could also be added to the mayor of the municipality of Schiitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache.
A variant taken into account is also the candidacy of the leader of the Jewish councillors of the PSD, Cristian Stanciu, where Lupu will no longer be in the race, coming from the party claiming that he is not interested in the operation.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is that of the former subsidiary leader, Mayor Gheorghe Niita.
The list of candidates is open.
In accordance with the statute, including in the election day, no one would be surprised if it happened.
"It is important that we remain united, and we will remain after 3 October, when we have a new Executive Bureau, a new Permanent Jewish Bureau and all new leadership structures," Câtea said.
Until the internal elections are organised, the leadership of the judicial branch of the PSD will be provided by Victorel Lupu, a close associate of Niita and Stanciu.
Lupu, however, is on leave until 29 September, preparing the elections to be practically assured by the executive secretary of the subsidiary, Jewish adviser Mihail Popescu, in cold relations with the Nichita camp.
Contacted by telephone, Christian Stanciu has appreciated the discussions in recent days as leading to "a partial consensus".
There is a wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
A partial consensus has been reached in support of a uniting team to deal with the trial.
"On the other hand, there are several options on the application intentions for the PSD Iaşi presidency, the list remaining open," Stanciu commented.
An exit judge refused the file of Vaslui rapists on the basis of concubination
The seven young men in Vaslui's trial convicted of rape arrive today at the Court of Appeal Iaşi.
The Vaslaws sentenced to imprisonment between five and eight months and eight and four months will present their arguments today on their release after the Tribunal, the Vaslui Judge, has determined their imprisonment immediately after the sentence has been passed.
The file was registered at the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, Magistrate Dan Anton making a request for detention, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton appealed that one of the defendant's lawyers, Bogdan Luca, was his daughter's concubine, attorney Dana Anton.
Luke defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, the one who received the greatest punishment in this file.
How Judges Motivated Judgment
At the end of last week, the judge of the Vaslui Court who sentenced the seven young people motivated the sentence.
For reasons, the judge is talking about the challenging reaction of the accused, but also of those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation among the public.
"The Court finds that after the time of the imposition under preventive judicial control, a restrictive measure of freedom but not a private measure of freedom, under the influence of the accused, their families and local supporters, a strong sense of anger was felt at the level of the local and national community as to the fact that persons accused of serious crimes are judged under a less restrictive measure," the reasoning of the Vaslu Judge shows.
The magistrates also disassembled the main defense of the seven accused who in the course of the trial invoked that the girl they raped would not be a "door of the church".
"The Court underlines that the moral quality of the injured person is irrelevant, the aspect that the accused have wanted to highlight through the defenses they have formulated, as a person's physical and sexual freedom cannot be violated under any pretext," it further states in the explanatory statement.
Corbyn, Brexit and Europe's future
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity enjoyed over the past ten years cannot continue the same in the following years.
By Saturday, probably a few people in Romania knew who Jeremy Corbyn is.
Even today, after he has become the new leader of the British Labour Party, many wonder how we can be affected by the choice of a politician who is ultimately not in a decision-making position.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical left-wing slave leader since the war.
Marxist stated, anti-monarist (at a given time Tony Blair, then prime minister, asked to take the royal family out of Buckingam Palace), a ferocious anti-American and Vladimir Putin's sympathizer (was otherwise regularly invited to comment on political events by the television channel "Russia Today"), and the terrorist movements Hizbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to give up nuclear weapons and leave NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who at that time considered the killing of Osama bin Laden as a real tragedy, ISIS is almost preferred by the United States.
After the model of all populist demagogies, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things about the kind of people he was saying and promising and Tsipras in Greece until he got in touch with the real world and economic legitimacy.
The economic programme of the new Labour Leader provides, among other things, for massive renationalisation and for the printing of money as a solution to finance development projects and to cover very generous social benefits.
Of course, some might wonder why the solution to the printing of money is not unanimously adopted on the globe, we would then have a global prosperity!, but who else would prevent such details.
Of course, we can charge bankers with blood, you become some kind of left-handed enemy, but since you have seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of Mitterand's and Holland's mandates.
The additional amounts are quickly swallowed by generous promises, without coverage, made by populist demagogies.
As Margaret Thatcher rightly pointed out, "the problem of socialism is that at some point the money of others ends."
A little bit gives Jeremy Corbyn a real chance to ever get to the prime minister.
In the early 1980s another radical left-wing leader, Michael Foot, who was still not as extreme in conviction as the party's fresh leader, failed in the elections.
And then there is still a working class in Britain, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were more powerful than they were now.
Under the conditions of the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant in the workforce as a whole, and extensive automations have made it necessary in industry to have a high-skilled workforce, Corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
But even from the opposition, he can influence important developments that can affect us directly.
In its last issue of the Financial Times, Corbyn considers that Corbyn's election increases Brexit's chances of leaving the EU, namely the UK.
The new Labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership in the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left, Brussels is an agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that has led to the austerity of the poor.
When you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with rhetorical anti-immigration and look at the crisis of refugees emerging from the EU foundations, it comes to an explosive mix.
And not just for Britain.
However, if the British decide after the referendum, which is to take place by 2017, to leave the Union the symbolic loss of capital for the entire European project and the deep flaws created within its Euro crisis and now therefore the refugees, between North and South, between East and West, leave room for the most worrying scenarios.
As much as for a whole series of Member States, London was a counterweight on the French-German axis (in which Berlin is becoming increasingly the dominant actor anyway).
It is true that the British business environment, the City, is a strong lawyer for the stay of the country in the EU.
But Europe today is no longer the past.
There are many reactions, which increase in intensity even in these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, we have just had a sample in Jean Claude Junker's speech, tends more and more to make major decisions over the heads of the great majority of the Member States by consulting only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And this happens under conditions where electoral support for anti-system formations, anti-immigration which are at the same time Eurosceptic increases spectacularly throughout the continent.
In other words, the emotional climate with negative loads has reached higher rates than ever before.
Where and the conclusion drawn by the Financial Times when assessing Brexit's chances.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that goes from national interest.
If voters want to make the brain decision, then the UK will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in the current policy.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as is expected, we will attend a more pronounced integration of the euro area, which will push most of the countries in the region and on the periphery of interest and that of the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States are feeding her populist rhetoric from the frustrations accumulated in Western societies.
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity enjoyed in the last ten years, the generous social benefits, cannot continue the same in the coming years.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro-Immigration Zone, both of the decisions that have not taken into account only the integrationist political ambitions, not the ability and availability of peoples and governments in Europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, the internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and may affect Romania more.
And it's hard to exclude something from the perspective of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our chief political leaders are able to deal with such complicated situations.
Constantine Brancuşi, the god of the country.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Bracelet: "Take and measure the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to be famous, to hear about him in all the world.
But behind his fame is something almost forgotten today, when millions of successful stories are delivered to us, written for success in life.
That thing has a name.
It's called hard.
What do you write about Constantine Brancushi?
What else is there to say, actually?
The figure appeared on the banknote.
And recently, a well-known bank in Romania hired an actor to play it in a commercial.
Branches have been producing and delivering money for almost 60 years since it's no longer among us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards that bear his name.
Otherwise, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he comes out with the grown-up, he hears the following instructions: "We're going to the park, at the branch."
The country is scattered by its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known by so many people, from children to adults.
Brancuşi's infiltration capacity is a huge one.
Communists have not been able to extract it from Romania's memory and culture.
Its cities are spreading the Internet today, receiving hundreds of thousands of Likes and Shares.
And then, again, what else would I say, write about this man?
Looking at a bunch of books and articles that are trying to reconstitute their destiny, Brancuşi's life seems almost fantastic, totally unlikely.
You know, it's those people who tell you that if you didn't have the luck of being born in a big city and in a family as hard as you could, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
Brancusi's life is the perfect counterexample.
And maybe there would be a key here.
Maybe this is where the next text should begin.
With a sentence, however abhorrent they are.
Look at the success stories that are delivered to you every day in the newspaper and on TV.
Look carefully at this man's figure.
Do you want to know how he managed to live, how today he heard a whole map world of him?
It's simple.
He worked all his life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantine Brancuşi was born on February 19, 1876 in Hobbita, a small village in the municipality of Peștișani, Gorj County, in the Carpathians' pools.
He is the fifth child of Mary and Radu Nicolae Brancuşi.
Although he came from a family of established countries, Brancuşi led a modest life, but one of which was to collect his pieces that would guide his later artistic vision.
Remembering the childhood and the places where he grew up, the artist had to confess, at a meeting with Peter Tützea, from Paris, 1933: "At that time life was beautiful and harmonious."
For millenniums, people have been leading, happy, a patriarchal life.
Everything passed quietly from one time to another.
And you know why things changed?
The civilization of the great city has reached us.
Brancusi's childhood, however, was far from an idyllic one.
One of the moments spent in these early years of life is extremely suggestive of the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor of the years spent in the home.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Brancuşi. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantine Brancuşi was 3 years old.
In the fall of that year, when the tug was made "the casino", following those who tasted the liquid to see if the process was going on properly, Brancusi caught a moment of general care.
He fills his palm tree with tea and drinks unsweetened.
He's falling asleep almost instantly.
The first people just observe in a few minutes.
Mom panics, then her wife thinks her son is dead.
At night, when the father, Radu, comes back from life accompanied by praisers, he sees from a distance the desperate signs of those waiting for him with his soul to his mouth.
The party is turned into a mess immediately.
The father is already thinking about the funeral.
However, someone thinks it's good to call Baba Brâduça, the dothoroi and the servants of the Brâcuça.
The frog checks the baby's breathing, then puts it under the horse's nose, gathered around.
The strong alien child.
The world's blaspheming.
While the boy is allowed to sleep further his bee, rejoicing, the party with laurines continues with more and more strength.
The second day, the father and son meet alive.
Radu Brancuşi puts Constantine to collect some nuts and bring them to them.
The father puts the child's head down and, with the nude brought by the boy, beats him to remember.
And while he feels the shock of the hits, the little Brancuşi has the revelation that the world can be seen from another perspective and that things around him can be turned around.
Especially the position of the sun, different from that of the well-known one, makes him wonder as to how he should recognize old age, unless the star himself participates in his disturbance.
Should the sun be as upset as his father was about what was happening to him?
At the current time, the city is not working
A parliamentarian calls on politicians to remember those who voted.
Independent MP Viorel Blajuț appealed to the PSD and PNL to stop internal fighting and reorient the agenda to the electorate.
What we now see on our political scene is a big mix and so on.
I haven't seen any of the 2012 USL projects to continue.
Neither the highway, nor the Regional Emergency Hospital, you see only how politicians compete with their possible locations according to their real estate interests.
Let's just leave politics a little off, let's get together and talk.
At the current time, the city doesn't work.
"If you're busy with the internal war, you don't have time for the ones who chose you," Blajut said.
He appreciated that the current political class had derailed the outgoing electorate, the result being a very low presence in the future local elections, around 30%, representing practically the faithful party's electorate.
The honourable Member also believes that voters will continue to focus on traditional parties, expressing their reservations about new political initiatives, such as the party "For Iaşi" that will be launched today.
Local parties have very small chances and will only break the law, not the PSD.
Such parties are based on civil active people, who are usually right.
"It's getting even more straight, which is not good for anyone, nor for the PSD," Blajut said.
He stated that he is not interested in a candidate for future local elections, denouncing his intention to enter the race for the Prime Minister.
I said I don't want to run for any local function.
I wonder if you will continue as a Member in the future.
I tried to appeal to the unit for Iaşi and in the discussion of the halls, with the other parliamentarians, and I was accused of wanting to imagine.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like this anymore.
"If people voted for us, it doesn't mean they're stupid to vote for us if I don't see anything," Blajut said, who appreciated that the main reason why the voter is no longer interested in politics is hypocrisy of his own.
A colleague from Dadarashi said he couldn't get the money and he had to take the bus.
Let's not be hypocrites.
There's no little money.
Sometimes I'm ashamed to raise the money from the cash register.
At the end of the term of office, I will make a report on all that I have spent, in addition to the salaries of the staff from the office and its maintenance.
It happened to rise in one month and 30,000 lei, with all the transportation, accommodation and other bills.
"Let's say a MP doesn't get his money is pure hypocrisy," Blajut concluded.
